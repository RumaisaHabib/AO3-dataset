I can't believe that I let him invite his friends.  Gryffindors, the lot of them, and in a few minutes, they will invade my house.

""Don't frown.  I promise they'll leave after the cake,"" Harry tells me with a smile.  ""You'll see, it'll be all right.""

I shake my head.  I've let a twenty year old run my life.  ""You didn't have to invite Black.""

He snorts.  ""Of course, I had to.  Don't worry he promised to behave.""

""You're more nave that I thought.  You still believe in miracles.""

He steps out of the shadows when I reach the door of my lab.  ""You're not going to hide all afternoon.""

""I'd like to think of it as obtaining some peace.""

His shoulders drop and the light disappears from his eyes.  ""You're right.  I shouldn't force you to spend time with me.""

The little brat is better than a Jewish mother with his guilty trips.  ""You would be more convincing if I didn't know what you were doing.""

I pretend not to understand.  The little tease has spent the entire party licking his lips, swaying his hips, pressing his arse against my groin when no one was looking - sometimes because someone was looking.

The worse part is that it's working.  I just want everyone to eat the bloody cake so I can have him, naked, lying over that table, licking him like the icing on his cake, until another type of cream covers him.

Hot and sweaty, head thrown back, neck exposed in subconscious submission.  He's beautiful when he rides my cock.

My orgasm surprises me; I come inside his willing body.  Only then I close my fist over his erection and pump him to completion.  His muscles clench around my softening member and I groan.

He slumps against my chest.  ""God, I love this.""

I snort.  ""It's just sex.""

""It's not.  I love you and you love me as well.""  He kisses my forehead.  ""Thank you for the party.""

""You're welcome,"" I concede.  ""I do love you,"" I whisper as he falls asleep."

""I'm thinking Triwizard-era Harry, I am a fan of the 90's grunge and the hair!"" 

Harry is thankful for the door to his office when he puts it down on his desk to scream in despair. The office was getting ready for the annual Harry Potter Day party, held officially by the Ministry of Fucking Magic. This year's theme, apparently, is to dress as all the various ""eras"" of him. Harry truly, and he means this sincerely, doesn't know what the hell that was even supposed to mean. 

""What about you, Shah?"" 

""I'm thinking post-war, travel Harry,"" Shah says, ""I really liked all of the unironic Hawaiian shirts."" 

Harry finally couldn't take it anymore and opened the door to his office suddenly glaring at the two junior Aurors. ""Or maybe, you could consider dressing as Aurors and do your jobs."" 

""Yes sir,"" Shah squeaked. 

Harry ran a hand through his hair. He's not normally a hardass boss, he's actually known in the office for being a huge softy. He enjoys mentoring young Aurors starting out in their careers, and his door is always open to talk to them as they deal with how hard and terrible human beings can be to each other. He wants his employees to be happy, goddamn it. He wants them to have work-life balance, he wants jokes in the office. 

It's fucking Harry Potter Day that he doesn't want. 

""Yelling at the babies, Potter?"" Solicitor Draco Malfoy says as he saunters up to Harry in the bullpen. 

""Please do me the favor of shutting up, Draco,"" Harry replies. They've worked together closely on hundreds of cases at this point, and they had long ago ceased with any real hostility. Besides, the semi-regular, semi-casual sex they have doesn't hurt. 

Draco, of course, doesn't shut up. ""I'm thinking new-Auror Harry for my outfit, back when you actually wore the uniform.""

""I do look fetching in red,"" Harry replies dryly. 

Draco wrinkles his nose, ""you do, but alas, I don't. Back to the drawing board, I guess. What are you coming as?"" 

Harry gives him a long, sarcastic look, and turns back to his office while saying, ""perhaps the only time in my life I didn't have problems when I was very briefly dead. Corpse Harry didn't know how lucky he was."" 

Harry hears Draco follow him, but Draco doesn't respond for a moment, before he very quietly says, ""don't joke about that."" 

Harry turns around and sees Draco standing in his office with a pale look of horror on his face. 

""I-- I mean, it's my death, I can joke about it if I want to."" 

""You didn't have to see your body,"" is all Draco says, simply. ""Are you even planning on going this year?"" 

""Of course not,"" Harry scoffs, he almost never goes. Occasionally, Hermione, who is planning to run for Minister of Magic one day, will bully him into attending so she can ""leverage his powerful national image."" 

Harry is so glad he's not a politician. 

""Why not? They're doing trivia this year, and I have a sneaking suspicion you'll win, the prize is a brand new MiriPhone."" 

""I have a MiriPhone, thank you,"" Harry says, referring to the new mirror technology that works the same way Sirius's two-way mirror did but allows you to call anyone with the charmed mirror. ""Besides- what trivia would there even be?""

""Which of the following dangerous creature did Harry Potter survive being bit by? A.) Acromantula, B.) Basilisk, C.) Sphinx, or D.) Inferi."" 

""Charming,"" Harry says dully. ""I can relive my childhood trauma, but at least I'll be able to write my grocery list on my phone. Why are you here anyway?"" 

""Need you to sign a few statements for the Aberdeen case,"" Draco says, pulling several roles of parchment out of his satchel. 

Harry looked them over, and they seemed fine to him so he signed them quickly. 

""So what will you be doing then?"" Draco asks, ""on your birthday?"" 

""I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I do not exist,"" Harry says with a sense of irony. ""So proud of the wizarding world for accomplishing what even my relatives couldn't do, and finally made me hate my birthday."" 

Draco looks at him and says, ""no."" 

""What do you mean, ""no""?"" 

""That is a terrible way to celebrate your birthday, and I am not having it."" 

""I suppose I wouldn't say no to a birthday shag,"" Harry says with a leer that makes Draco chuckle. 

""I mean, obviously, but I'll figure something out. Regardless, I'm off- Some absolute idiot in my department accidentally filed everything from a case in, and you will not believe this, Madagascar.""

Harry looks at him, stunned, ""How?"" 

Draco looks just as helpless as he shrugs. 

Harry pushes the thought of his birthday out of his mind and focuses on the work instead. In proportional response to the general Wizarding community's love of Harry Potter day, dark wizards tend to view it as the perfect time for a large strike against the government or against Harry himself. He's even come to be amused by some of the more far fetched assassination attempts. 

The one that featured a sexy treacle tart that was meant to seduce him into taking a poisoned bite was strangely charming. 

Still, he knows it takes a lot out of his department, especially the young ones who weren't really politically conscious during the war. It's sweet how many of them become incredibly protective of him as his birthday rolls closer. 

Including, Preety Shah, a young Ravenclaw who just joined their ranks. She was on death threat duty for the past week, and Harry can see it wearing on her. Still, he realizes he should have said something sooner when he sees her in an abandoned hallway crying. 

""Hey, Shah,"" Harry says casually, and slides down the wall next to her on the floor.

She gasps audibly and says, ""Sir, I'm so--"" 

Harry put his hand up, ""it's okay. It's hard, they say some pretty gross stuff in those letters.""

""How can you stand it?"" she asks miserably. ""I can't wait until none of this bothers me anymore."" 

Harry shakes his head, ""hey, no. That isn't the point. The best Aurors never lose their sense of horror, of injustice. If you stop being hurt by these things, you start seeing people as victims or perpetrators. You forget that they were probably funny, or had friends. I know most bosses don't tell you this, but my favorite Aurors are always the ones with thin skin."" 

""But how do you stand it then?"" 

""You remember that you're lucky,"" Harry says with a shrug. ""I'm so lucky that I have the skills and tools available to help people, to protect people, to help people find closure. So many people worry about the people they love, but they have no means to actually protect them. We do, I would so much rather know every death threat about Hermione, because then I can protect her. I'm lucky I see them.""

She looks at him like she's never seen him before, ""I can't believe you've done this your whole life."" 

""I guess I got Stockholm Hero'ed.""

She gives a wet laugh.

""Head home, we can keep looking through the threats tomorrow.""

She nods and goes to stand up when her face turns bright red, ""Solicitor Malfoy!"" 

Harry turns to see Draco with an unreadable look on his face. Shah scampers past him.

""How long have you been standing there?""

""Long enough to hear your pep talk, very sweet,"" Draco says. ""You... That really is what it's all about for you, isn't it? Keeping the people you love safe.""

""I've lost enough loved ones for a lifetime,"" is all Harry can say in return. 

Draco offers his hand to pull Harry from the ground. ""Busy tonight?""

Harry smirks, ""I have a feeling I'm about to be."" 

Draco's gaze turns feral, ""I do so love your smart arse. I wonder if I can send you in limping tomorrow."" 

""Promises, promises,"" Harry replies, walking out with Draco.

""Oh, and Harry,"" Draco says right before they floo out, ""I know what I'm doing for your birthday."" 

Harry just rolls his eyes.

He had almost forgotten what Draco said when July 31st rolls around. Because his birthday is a government holiday, he always has it off, which is nice in some ways. This year, the day fell on a Tuesday, causing the Ministry to give all nonessential employees both Monday and Tuesday off. 

He wakes up to a pretty fantastic blow job that almost makes the day worth it, but Draco has an evil smirk on his face. For the past several weeks he's clearly been plotting something, and Harry is slightly terrified. He hopes it isn't going to end in an orgy of Harry Potter lookalikes. 

Still, Draco doesn't actually make him do anything until five pm rolls around. Roughly the time one would get ready for the Ministry ball. Harry is immediately suspicious. 

""For the last time!"" Draco says with exasperation, ""we are not going to the ball. Now put on the outfit I picked for you."" 

It doesn't look like a party outfit, it's a plain t-shirt and, bafflingly, a pair of shorts. 

""Now,"" Draco says when Harry is dressed. ""Put this on, and give me your wand."" 

He's holding a blindfold in one hand and the other is reaching for Harry's wand on the dresser. 

Harry feels a spike of anxiety, ""you want... my wand?""

""Just trust me,"" Draco says, his voice is brisk but his eyes are a little nervous like he's not sure Harry really does trust him. 

But, Harry does. He would never give someone he didn't trust access to his home, after all. He hands over the wand and Draco helps him tie the blindfold. 

He feels Draco apparate him somewhere and it feels warm, he smiles, figuring out what Draco's plan was. Clearly, they were going to have a lovely beach vacation. That was even kind of romantic, even though technically Harry and Draco never said anything about their arrangement. 

The fact that Harry doesn't go out with or fuck anyone else, and neither does Draco seems beside the point. 

""Okay, you can take off the blindfold in 3...2...1..."" 

Harry rips it off right as a crowd of people yells, ""SURPRISE!"" 

Harry immediately reaches for his wand to defend himself, but then takes a look and sees... 

Everyone he loves. The Weasleys, Ron, Hermione, Teddy, Luna, Neville, just everyone. 

""Happy birthday, Harry!"" Draco mutters in his ear.

Harry glances around frantically and sees a table filled with hearty, delicious foods he loves, a no-fuss, but delicious-looking cake, and even a pick-up Quidditch pitch. 

And, without any warning, Harry promptly bursts into tears. 

""Harry!"" Draco says, alarmed. Harry isn't surprised by his tone, Harry almost never cries, and never like this but Harry pulls him into a fierce hug and weeps a little on his shoulder. 

""Are you okay?"" Draco says again, ""was this a bad idea? I can pack everyone off--""

""Don't you dare,"" Harry said with a watery voice. ""I'm just... This is just.. the most wonderful thing anyone has ever done for me."" 

Draco relaxes, ""oh, you big git. Stop sobbing on my shoulder then and go see your friends!"" 

Harry reluctantly pulls himself off and is immediately hugged by five more people. There isn't a single photograph of him anywhere, and no one makes a single joke about Harry Potter Day, not even George. 

And Hermione is here. 

""You! I thought the Harry Potter Day parties were too big a deal,"" Harry says, stunned to see her. 

""Don't be stupid,"" Hermione says fiercely, ""you're my best bloody friend, and we are going to have a good time."" 

And they do. They eat cake, and laugh, and play Quidditch. Teddy shows Harry that he can make his hair pink now, which fills Harry with a painful, but happy nostalgia at the thought of Tonks. Harry tears up again when he realizes they are on a beach vacation, Draco has rented a beach villa on Ibiza. Harry bloody loves the beach, which Draco knows. 

And later, once he's properly tipsy, he even dances. 

He even slow dances, surrounded by his friends, in the arms of a man he loves. 

Another gift to himself, he supposes. 

""So, you had a good night?"" Draco mutters into his ear as they slowly dance in the warm summer air. The scent of salt water fills Harry's sense and mixes with the smell of Draco's expensive cologne. He can't believe that this man did all of this, made this perfect day, just for him. 

""This was the best birthday I've ever had in my entire life,"" Harry says, looking up at Draco's gray eyes. ""I love you too, by the way."" 

Draco rolls his eyes a little but his face splits into a beam, ""of course you do, Potter. As you should, here I am slaving over birthday parties for you--"" 

Harry laughs and leans up to kiss him. They had never really kept it a secret, but they never really told anyone either. Still, no one seems surprised, and he even sees Ron give him a thumbs up. 

""I do, you know,"" Draco says softly when they pull away. ""Love you. You didn't exactly let me say it."" 

And at that moment Harry Potter felt just like everyone else: glad, for the first time in many years, that it was his birthday."

It had been going on for some months, their affair. Draco would come over drunk and fuck Harry when ever was convenient.

 

There would be no Christmas morning for him and his lover. Harry was certain that the memory of him in Draco's thoughts wouldn't be possible. Draco told him once that he was just a fuck.

 

He saw Draco with Pansy while browsing through the shops in Diagon Alley.

 

""Draco, look there's Harry Potter,"" she said.

 

""Potter.""

 

""Malfoy.""

 

""See you later,"" Draco whispered.

 

* * *

 

Pansy didn't miss the look exchanged between the men as they left the shop. Pansy walked into Madam Malkin's and ordered several new expensive dress robes to punish Draco for what he was doing. He was turning them into a laughingstock of pureblood society.

 

Her motto with Draco had always been, smile in public; bitch in private. As soon as they arrived back at their home, Pansy turned on him.

 

""HOW DARE YOU!""

 

Draco raised an eyebrow and took off his winter cloak. ""How dare I what?""

 

""Draco, I know you're fucking Potter.""

 

""You can't prove--""

 

""I've seen you.""

 

 

 * * *

 



Harry was surprised when there was a knock on the door. He planned for a quiet Christmas Eve curled up in his favorite chair, flipping through channels on the television. He stood and walked over to the door.

 

""Who is it?""

 

""Malfoy.""

 

Harry sighed and thought, 'For fuck sakes, it was Christmas Eve.' He had declined Molly and Hermione's offer to spend the holidays with them and their families. He just wanted to be alone this year. His hand drifted toward the doorknob and turned it.

 

He was greeted with the site of a disheveled Draco Malfoy.

 

""Hello --""

 

""She's dead.""

 

* * *

 

Harry blinked and stammered, ""I'm sorry, I thought I heard you say she's dead?""

 

""She is dead. Pansy is fucking dead.""

 

""Malfoy? Why is Pansy dead?""

 

Draco pushed past Harry striding into the flat. He threw himself down in a chair and put his hands over his face.

 

""Draco, What's--""

 

""Don't fucking Draco me, Harry. She found out!""

 

""What do you mean?""

 

Draco sighed and said in a choked voice, trying to keep his emotions in check. ""The bitch had someone following me. She threatened me and I-I killed her.""

 

""What curse?""

 

Draco shook his head.

 

""What curse?""

 

* * *

 

Harry watched Draco sleeping in the chair he had been occupying earlier that evening. The former Slytherin had demanded a bottle of alcohol and proceeded to drink until he passed out. If someone had told Harry that he would be spending Christmas with someone he cared about, he wouldn't have believed them.

 

He sat on his sofa and thought that Draco couldn't have been very comfortable in the chair. Harry stood and retrieved his wand from his pocket. He spoke the charm and levitated Draco into his bedroom, placing him on the bed. Harry lay down gently next to him.

 

* * *

 

Draco stirred in his sleep when he felt hands on his sides, gently caressing him. He moaned as the hand skated across his abdomen, pulling his shirt from his trousers. He felt something firm pressing against his backside and Draco's eyes flew open.

 

""Potter, what are you doing?""

 

""Shhh, I'm just trying to help you relax, Draco. Doesn't it feel good to relax?"" Harry whispered into the man's ear and then squeezed Draco's half-hard cock through the material.

 

Draco tried turning around but found that Harry was holding his wrist together with his other hand.

 

""Fuck.""

 

""Oh, I plan to.""

 

* * *

 

He slid his hands up and down Draco's torso after securing his wrist to the headboard with a pair of dress socks. Harry carefully positioned Draco so that he lay on his back, then straddled the other male. Draco looked up at Harry expectantly.

 

Lowering himself onto the distended area of Draco's trousers Harry started rocking back and forth, eliciting a small groan from Draco's throat. Harry smirked and began rubbing harder. He could gauge that Draco was very close to an orgasm so he stopped.

 

""Potter,"" Draco whined.

 

Harry patted Draco's cheek, ""Don't worry, I'll make sure you come, soon.""

 

* * *

 

Harry took Draco's rumpled clothing off carefully, discarding it. The bound man was glaring at his assailant as if daggers could come out of his eyes and fatally wound Harry. Fingertips slid gently up Draco's legs and he squirmed.

 

""That tickles,"" he said with a tight voice.

 

""Would you rather it hurt,"" Harry said, as he none too gently pinched Draco's inner thigh. Draco moaned at the jab of pain and then the pleasure as Harry kissed the red area.

 

Harry undressed and then positioned himself on the bed again. He placed his hands on Draco's thighs and pushed up.

 

* * *

 

The differences between Harry's lovemaking and the way Draco fucked were apparent. Draco always had Harry kneeling on all fours. If it struck the blonde's fancy he could reach forward and pull on those tar-coloured locks of hair or have his pale fingers dig into Harry's hips, leaving bruises the next day.

 

Harry prepared Draco carefully. There was a hitch of breath as the muscles surrounding Harry's length gave away and allowed him passage. Draco squeezed his eyes closed as if he could block out the pain.

 

""Harry, I--""

 

""Shhh, it's okay.""

 

""Didn't mean to kill her-Oh Merlin.""

 

* * *

 

Harry lay on top of Draco, still inside him, panting. His black hair was plastered to his forehead and his lips pressed against the surface of Draco's collarbone.

 

Draco could feel the wetness of Harry's release. He could smell the faint odor of sex. He tasted blood and bile rising in his throat. He wanted to cry but being a Malfoy meant you were never allowed such a luxury. He lifted his head to see green eyes looking back at him.

 

Draco was surprised as he heard his own voice saying, ""I used The Killing Curse.""

 

""It'll be sorted out."""

Somehow, in spite of that fact, he'd imagined that his 19th birthday would be different. Last year, on his 18th birthday, when they'd spent the day rebuilding Hogwarts, Harry had reflected on his many terrible birthdays and told himself that 18 would be the last bad one. He'd told himself that on his 19th birthday there would be a party, he'd have his friends around him, and maybe just for that one day, they could forget everything bad and just have fun.

But now he was single, living in muggle London, without any friends nearby, and without any happy plans in place. He decided that he had to do something today, there must be something that could make his birthday not quite so glum.

He set off toward a coffee shop a few blocks from his house and ran smack into a door as a woman was coming out. She apologized but Harry was too distracted by what he saw inside of the store. From where he stood he could see reptiles, and birds, and he thought he could make out cats in the corner, and somewhere there was the faint sound of puppies yipping.

Waving the woman off he entered the animal shelter, feeling like might have found something good after all. He wandered in; first past the birds, then the reptiles, then to the kittens and full-grown cats. He paused with the cats for a little while, trailing his fingers along their cages and talking to them softly. Then he moved past them to the dogs and puppies.

There had to be about 10 altogether, different breeds and types, some sleeping, some playing together, some just wandering about sniffing. Several came charging over to the edge of their pen when they saw him, wagging their tails eagerly and he just knew. He looked up and waved to a sales associate who was straightening some pet supplies. ""Sorry, I just wonder if I could meet some of the dogs?""

""Oh, sure!"" she replied brightly. ""Draco is on the dogs today, I'll call him over. Just a mo.""

That was an odd name, Harry thought, it must be a coincidence. Surely Draco Malfoy wouldn't be working in a Muggle Animal Shelter of all places. It was preposterous. Yet a moment later he heard a voice he'd recognize anywhere, ""Sir, is there something I can help you with?""

Harry's jaw dropped and he turned to look at the boy who had been his nemesis for several years, ""Malfoy?"" he asked incredulously, yet somehow he couldn't find it in himself to be surprised. It was his birthday after all.

""Potter? What in Merlin's name are you doing here?""

""Oh, you boys know each other?"" Annie asked with a wide smile.

""Uh,"" Harry said inarticulately even as Malfoy said, ""Yes, we went to school together.""

""Oh, it's always nice to run into old friends!"" she exclaimed. ""Well, I'll just leave you two to catch up and to find this young man a puppy!""

""You're here to adopt a puppy?"" Malfoy asked incredulously.

""Or a grown-up dog,"" Harry replied defensively, feeling like this sort of luck was quite typical of his birthdays.

""And you just happened to show up at the one shelter in all of London that I work at?""

""Well, it's not like I knew you worked here. It's my birthday and I just wanted one happy thing-""

""A dog is a big commitment. It's not just something you decide you want one day then discard the next.""

""I know that!"" he protested. ""And I want a commitment. I want something to love and take care of, something that loves me in return. I want something that is there all the time.""

Malfoy stared at him for a long moment. ""Alright. What kind of dog are you looking for?""

""I don't know. I thought maybe I could meet them and then I'd know which one was the right one.""

""Trust me, Potter, if you do it that way you'll take home 5 dogs.""

""Maybe I want five dogs,"" Harry said stubbornly. ""It's not like I've got anything else on at the moment.""

Malfoy snorted, ""Have you ever owned a dog, Potter?""

""No,"" Harry replied. ""Have you?""

""No,"" Malfoy said. ""For one thing I'm not allowed to have them in my flat and for another, I don't have the time and energy for a dog. Dogs are a lot of work and I'm not saying you can't do it,"" he said, as Harry opened his mouth to protest. ""I'm just saying, maybe you should start with one dog.""

Harry frowned but it did make sense, he supposed.

""Come on, Potter, tell me about your ideal dog and I'll still let you meet all of them,"" he said as he started toward the back. When Harry didn't follow he said, ""Come on, you can't meet them out there.""

Harry followed him through a door that led behind the glass.

""So, when you imagine your perfect dog, do you think you want a dog with a lot of energy or that's a little more lowkey?""

""Umm,"" Harry said, imagining that he'd like a dog who wanted to play but also thinking of how hard some days were. ""Maybe a little lower energy, but one that would still like taking walks and want to play a little bit each day.""

""Well, most of our dogs will want to play at least a little bit here and there,"" he replied. ""So meet Artemis first,"" he said, as he went into the area all of the dogs were in and led one dog out. ""She is not for you,"" he said as the dog bounded over to Harry and Harry knelt down to pet her. She licked his face and put her paws up on his shoulders to sniff his hair.

""Why isn't she for me?"" he asked, tipping his head up to avoid being licked in the mouth. ""Hi Artemis,"" he said. ""Hello, beautiful girl,"" he said as he stroked her sides, combing through her soft fur. ""You're a lovie, aren't you?""

""She is,"" Malfoy confirmed, rubbing her head between her ears. ""But our Artemis is part Australian Cattle Dog which means she is very high energy. She needs to run every day regardless of the weather and she needs a lot of stimulation. She is a very smart girl and there will be a perfect home for her, but you aren't it.""

""But I like her,"" Harry said, wrestling with her a little bit.

""You'll like lots of them,"" he said. ""I promise."" Then he added, ""And if she is your favorite, there's nothing saying she can't come back out so you can have her.""

""Alright,"" Harry agreed reluctantly.

""Alright,"" Malfoy repeated. ""So that's Artemis, you can meet Pontus next,"" he said, before calling Artemis back to the playroom where the other dogs were. ""Pontus isn't completely trained yet, we're still working with him on basic commands, so I'll just have to go in and get him.""

Harry nodded and sat back on his heels to wait, a moment later a huge dog came out, panting and dragging Malfoy behind him.

""Pontus,"" Malfoy said reprovingly.

Harry couldn't help but laugh as the dog barreled into him and knocked him off his feet with a couple of raucous barks. He pinned Harry's shoulders to the floor and licked his face quite thoroughly, butting his glasses completely off his face. ""Hey, boy,"" Harry managed, pushing at his broad chest so he could sit up.

Malfoy was tugging at the dog's collar, seemingly to no avail. Finally, between the two of them, they got him enough off of Harry that he could sit up.

""Well, hello to you, too, handsome,"" Harry said with a chuckle as he scratched behind his ears and Pontus tried to sit in his lap.

""Pontus is very sweet but he is an oaf,"" Malfoy said as he brushed his hair back out of his face. ""He is part American Pitbull and part something huge and dumb. We can't quite figure him out.""

""He's a nice boy,"" Harry said as Pontus tried to chew on a bit of Harry's fringe.

""No,"" Malfoy reprimanded the dog, tugging him back from Harry. ""Yes, he is, but he needs a firm hand, Potter, and you are too soft. Once he's trained a little bit he'll be a very good boy but you just let him eat your hair so you're definitely not his.""

""Yeah,"" Harry said, patting the dog's side. ""I think you're probably right.""

""Did you hit your head on the floor when he knocked you over?""

""Not really,"" Harry said as he reached back to rub the back of his head and Pontus butted him to get him to keep petting him, ""Yes, alright, you demanding thing,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Why do you ask?""

""Well because you admitted I was right and it didn't seem to hurt you even a little bit.""

Harry laughed, ""You're a git. I'll have you know it didn't hurt me one bit.""

""My, my,"" Malfoy said with a small smile, ""Is this what we call character development?""

""Yes, I see you,"" Harry said as Pontus flopped over onto his back on top of Harry's legs so he could rub his belly.

""He likes you,"" Malfoy said with a grin.

Harry looked up at him, ""He seems pretty friendly, Malfoy. I bet he likes everyone.""

Malfoy shrugged one annoyingly elegant shoulder, ""Not really. He's usually not too keen on men, in fact.""

""And you let him all but attack me?"" Harry asked in mock offense. ""I mean, I know you don't like me, Malfoy, but killing me seems a little much.""

Malfoy rolled his eyes, ""He doesn't attack people. It's a common misconception about his breed. It's all about how they are raised and trained, just like it is with every dog. Except possibly chihuahuas.""

Harry laughed, ""I don't know anything about his breed,"" he said honestly. ""I just meant that he tackled me to the floor pretty quickly.""

""Yes,"" he said, ""But when Pontus doesn't like someone he cowers from them, he doesn't attack them. He will do whatever he can to put as much distance and as many obstacles as he can between him and the person he's afraid of.""

""Well, I think he's sweet,"" Harry said, his heart in his throat at the thought of this poor dog being so afraid. ""Maybe I could adopt him-"" he started.

""Oh no you don't,"" Malfoy said and he leaned down and grasped Pontus' collar once more. ""His person will come and in the meantime, he will have us to look after him. He is not the dog for you; he will wreck your entire house and you'll let him. He deserves a family who will train him and teach him to be a good boy because he wants to be a good boy.""

Pontus stood up and wagged his tail at Malfoy, slapping Harry across the face. ""Ow!"" Harry said, shoving at Pontus' rear end, ""Stop hitting me with your tail. That hurts!""

""His tail is very strong,"" Malfoy said with a chuckle, ""Come on you,"" he said to Pontus, ""You can go back and play.""

A moment later he came back in, carrying a squirmy puppy in his arms. Harry reached out for it immediately, ""Hello,"" he cooed at it as the pup started to sniff him.

""This is Caerus,"" he said. ""He's a beagle mix, which is quite obvious by his love of sniffing and by his sweet floppy ears.""

""Hi Caerus,"" Harry said, holding him up so they were nose to nose, ""You are very cute. Yes, you are.""

""He's just going up for adoption,"" Malfoy said. ""He was a little touch-and-go for a while, his brother and sisters all died. He was in a very unsafe situation when we found him and we really didn't know if he'd make it or not, but he's a fighter.""

He squirmed to get down and Harry set him on the floor and he took off sniffing around the room they were in, following his nose.

""He will have no trouble being adopted. He is young and adorable, and people love puppies.""

""He is really cute,"" Harry said as he watched him run around. ""But he's not for me.""

""I agree,"" he replied.

""Why?""

""Oh, you're looking for someone who's a real rescue.""

""What does that even mean?"" Harry asked.

Malfoy watched the little dog walking around the room, investigating and sniffing as he said, ""It means that you have a hero complex, Potter, which I can't even blame you for because you were raised to have one. But you want to rescue a dog who's come from a rough life and knows it. You want a dog that will love you unconditionally and whose sun rises and sets with you.""

""Well-"" Harry started, feeling a little defensive.

""That wasn't a criticism,"" Malfoy said quickly. ""It's a good thing. It means that you want to really bond with your dog and vice versa. Frankly, you'll be a great pet parent.""

""Err,"" Harry said inarticulately. ""Thanks, Malfoy.""

""Don't mention it,"" he said with another one of those shrugs. ""Besides, you're not cut out to train a puppy.""

Harry laughed, ""I could learn.""

""You could,"" he conceded. ""Maybe. You don't like to be the bad guy and sometimes when you're training a dog you have to be able to say a firm no. Especially with puppies."" Before Harry could respond, Malfoy was bending over and scooping up Caerus, ""Alright, Mister. Back to the puppy room with you,"" he said, pressing a kiss to the top of his head.

When he came back he brought two puppies with him, both with curly, white hair. ""Meet Castor and Pollux,"" he said.

""Hello,"" Harry replied, petting both of them as they squirmed on the floor and started to tousle with one another, both yipping happily as they played.

""We are hoping someone will adopt them as a set. They've never been apart a day in their lives and they basically only socialize with one another, no matter what we do with them. They both cry inconsolably when they are separated."" He crouched down beside Harry and stroked one of their backs, ""They are also definitely not for you, but I told you that you could meet all of them.""

""Thanks,"" Harry said with a smile as Malfoy scooped them back up and carried them back to the other room.

A moment later he came in, walking slowly and leading a dog who limped along behind him. ""This is Molly,"" he said as he led her over to Harry. She wagged her tail happily at him and plopped down next to him. ""She is the sweetest, gentlest dog you've ever met.""

Harry stroked her head and she laid her head on his lap.

""She's a black lab mix and she is a love,"" he said as he crouched next to Harry once more, ""She has had a hard life and she would love you until the day she died, but she is also not for you.""

""What?"" Harry asked, looking up at Malfoy, ""Why not?""

""Well first because she is special needs, she's blind, her liver is pretty much shot, she's all but deaf, she can't manage stairs, and she is on a variety of medications.""

""I could learn how to deal with all of those things!"" Harry protested. ""Poor girl, she just needs a home.""

""That's the second reason you can't have her,"" he said. ""She's already been adopted. She's the owner's dog. He just brings her along because he can't leave her alone at home all day.""

""Oh,"" Harry said.

""Yes, oh,"" Malfoy replied. ""She's a good old girl.""

""Why doesn't her name match all the others?""

Malfoy flushed slightly and Harry couldn't help but find it a little charming, ""I named all of the others,"" he confessed. ""We just need something to call them while they're here and I like to give them new names if they've come from somewhere else to help distance them from their pasts. People can change their names when they leave.""

""That's sweet,"" Harry said.

""Shut up,"" Malfoy replied.

Harry laughed, ""What? It is.""

He rolled his eyes, ""Alright, Miss Molly, let's go. We have to find this prat a dog and you can't be it,"" he told her as he gave her a gentle tap and started leading her out. ""No, you cannot. Your dad would never give you up. No,"" he said as the door closed behind him.

Next, he came in carrying a tiny dog who was yipping at him, ""Yes, yes, Hermes. We all hear you.""

He set the dog down and he immediately ran over to Harry, still barking at him. Harry held out a hand to the dog to sniff, ""Hello there.""

Hermes yipped at him and then ran over to Malfoy yipping before returning to Harry once more.

""Hermes thinks it's his job to tell everyone everything. He basically never stops barking.""

""Aptly named then,"" Harry said as he reached out and stroked a hand down his back.

""He's part chihuahua, we're certain,"" Malfoy continued. ""And he is trained and housebroken, his only problem is that he doesn't stop barking.""

""Will a dog like this find a home?"" Harry asked, even though he knew it couldn't be with him.

""Oh, certainly,"" he replied. ""He's young and healthy and has his basic training. There are people out there who will not mind his barking one bit.""

""I'm not one of them,"" Harry said as he handed Hermes back to Malfoy.

""No,"" he replied. ""There are two more,"" he said. ""And while I think either of them could be right for you, I'm saving the one I think is perfect for last.""

""Alright.""

""I only say this so that you don't fall completely head over heels for the next one before meeting Penelope.""

""I'll do my best,"" Harry assured him.

A few minutes later he returned with a giant black dog ambling along behind him, ""This is Gaia,"" he said.

Harry's heart melted as the dog walked straight over to him and flopped down on his feet. ""Hello beautiful girl,"" he said as he stroked through her thick fur.

""Gaia is a six-year-old Newfoundland mix. She is house trained already, she's a very low energy dog but she'll go on walks and play with you. She is a very sweet girl.""

""Yeah,"" Harry said, he brushed his thumb along her cheek and she stared at him with her big brown eyes. ""Hi,"" he said softly.

""She would love you unconditionally,"" Malfoy said as he knelt beside Harry.

""Why do you think she isn't perfect for me?""

""More than half of her life is already over,"" Malfoy said. ""Which isn't necessarily a bad thing."" He glanced down at the dog and stroked her side.

""But..."" Harry prompted.

""But,"" Malfoy said before taking a deep breath. ""You've seen a lot of death,"" he looked up at Harry then, his eyes so clear and sincere that they seemed to pierce into Harry's very soul. ""Newfies typically live 8-10 years."" He raised one shoulder, ""She would be great for you, but she is going to leave you far too soon.""

Harry's eyes stung and he looked away from Draco and down at Gaia who had fallen asleep. ""Will she get adopted?""

""Yes,"" Malfoy said without even a moment's hesitation. ""She is a sweet, sweet girl and people love big dogs. I give her two weeks in here tops.""

Harry stroked her ear between his fingers, ""If I tell you to bring in the last one but decide I like her better?""

""You can still adopt her,"" he said quickly. ""Sending her back now doesn't hurt a thing.""

He nodded once, ""Alright.""

Malfoy nodded back, ""Come on, Miss Gaia,"" he said. ""Up you get, you sleepy girl.""

She stood up, turning to look at Harry for a moment and wagging her bushy tail at him, before lumbering after Malfoy once more.

When he returned he was leading a small tan dog behind him. ""This,"" he said as he scooped her up, ""Is Penelope.""

As Malfoy started to hand her to Harry she started wagging her tail so hard that her entire body wiggled with the movement. Harry laughed as he took her into his arms, ""Well hello little one,"" he said. She bumped her nose against his before licking his cheek. ""Hi,"" he said again.

She squirmed a bit, so he set her down, thinking this is where any that had gone wrong went wrong but she didn't walk away, she stood up on her hind legs and pressed her front paws against his chest so she could lick under his chin.

He laughed and stroked down her sides, she was super soft and he said as much to Malfoy.

He nodded, ""Yeah, our best guess for breed is a chihuahua-frenchie or chihuahua-pug mix. The pug or frenchie would account for the wrinkles that she gets in her forehead, how soft she is, her barrel chest, and the way her little ears look. Chihuahua would account for the long legs and slender build in spite of her barrel chest.""

She took her feet off Harry's chest and Harry held his breath to see what she would do. She turned away and he thought that his mind was made up but then she turned in a circle in between his legs, then another, then a third before laying down pressed against his body as close as she could get.

Something made Harry feel like he was choking as he watched her settle against him.

""She likes you,"" Malfoy said softly. ""Miss Penelope is almost two. She is potty and kennel trained already but will need a little help learning basic commands, she's relatively young so it shouldn't be too hard. She doesn't like going on walks when it's too hot or too cold, but when the weather is nice she enjoys them. She likes to play fetch and she really likes to chew things. But her favorite thing is a lap to curl up on under a blanket.""

""She's so small,"" Harry said softly.

""Fifteen pounds,"" Malfoy affirmed.

""Would she want to sleep in a kennel at night?"" Harry asked.

""If you wanted her to,"" he said.

""And if I didn't?""

""She loves to get up on furniture with people. I'm sure she'd be glad to sleep in bed with you if that's what you're asking.""

She lifted her head up from where it was tucked against her chest and plopped it on Harry's thigh, gazing up at him with warm caramel eyes.

""She would adore you,"" Malfoy said softly. ""I named her Penelope because I knew that whoever she chose as her person she would be unendingly faithful to.""

""Yeah,"" Harry said, stroking her head before running her ear between his fingers.

Over the earpiece Malfoy was wearing, Harry could hear Annie requesting back up on the sales floor.

""Why don't you two take a little more time together,"" Malfoy said. ""I'll go check in with Annie and then when I come back you can tell me what you've decided.""

Penelope lifted her head as Malfoy left the room watching him until the door closed before turning to look at Harry.

""It's alright,"" Harry said, stroking his fingers down her side. ""He'll be back."" He picked her up, holding her in his arms like an infant, and she huffed a little breath before settling her head on his shoulder, tucking her nose into his neck.

""It's alright,"" he said again, even though she didn't seem perturbed in the least. ""What do you think, then?"" he asked her. ""Hmm?""

She pressed her nose against his neck and gave him a tiny lick.

""Do you want to come live with me?"" he asked her.

Her tail twitched back and forth a few times.

""Is that a yes?"" he asked as he turned his head to press his face into the fur on her shoulder. ""Hmm? You want to come home with me?""

More waggles and Harry couldn't help but smile at her.

""Do you like the name Penelope?"" he asked her, shifting her so that he could see her face, he brushed his thumb over her black whiskers and she turned her head away, ""Well you don't like that, do you?"" he asked and he brushed his thumb under her eye to clear a little gunk. ""Sorry, little one.""

She let out a little huff at him and he couldn't help but chuckle at her.

He held her and pet her, talking to her softly. He fell completely in love with her in a matter of minutes.

When the door opened and Malfoy stepped back in, Harry said, ""Can I take her home today?""

""Yeah,"" Malfoy said with a smile. ""There's a whole bunch of paperwork for you to fill out first but wait until you get a load of their quills. There's no inkpot or anything.""

Harry laughed, ""They're pens, not quills.""

""You know about them?"" Malfoy asked incredulously.

""I lived with muggles after my parents died until I was 11. Yes, I know what pens are.""

Malfoy huffed, ""Why wouldn't you have brought them to Hogwarts? Why didn't you use them there? It would have been so much smarter.""

""You wouldn't have wanted anything to do with pens,"" Harry replied with a laugh.

""Well, that's probably true. But I was an idiot.""

Before Harry could say anything in response or even process that remark fully, Malfoy was reaching for Penelope, ""Let me put her with the others while we get you squared away.""

""No!"" Harry said quickly, clutching her tighter against him.

""I'll give her back, I promise,"" Malfoy said.

""Can't she just stay with me?"" Harry pleaded.

Malfoy looked at him for a moment, ""Yes, alright, but don't let her distract you from the work you have to do.""

""I won't.""

""Here,"" he said, holding out a contraption to Harry. ""Put this on her, she can't be loose out on the sales floor.""

""Err,"" Harry said as he reached for it. ""How do I?""

Malfoy rolled his eyes, ""Merlin, Potter. It's a harness,"" he said. ""Here, set her on the floor and I'll show you how to put it on her. It's so you can walk her on a leash.""

""Can't I just use a collar?"" he asked.

""No,"" Malfoy said as he lifted one of her front legs through a hole, then the other. ""Small dogs, in general, do better with harnesses than collars. Unlike larger dogs, she has a more fragile trachea so we put a harness on her instead.""

""Is she okay, though?""

""Oh, yes,"" he said quickly as he snapped the harness over her back. ""Right,"" Malfoy said, passing him the end of her leash. ""This way, I'll take you in to see Jeff and get her paperwork filled out.""

""Great, thanks,"" Harry said, ""Alright, Penelope,"" he said, ""let's go."" She wagged her tail and stared up at him.

""Do you have the things you'll need for your home?""

Harry shook his head, ""Can I get those things here?""

""Yes. After you fill out her adoption paperwork.""

""Will you help me make sure I get everything she needs?"" Harry asked quickly, afraid he'd miss something essential.

Malfoy gave him a smile and a small nod.

When they went to the office, Malfoy knocked on the door and someone, Jeff, Harry presumed, called for him to enter.

""Hi Jeff, this is Harry Potter,"" Malfoy said, gesturing for Harry to enter the room. ""He's here to adopt Penelope.""

The man at the desk looked up over the top of his glasses and gave Harry a warm smile. ""That is wonderful news! Come in.""

""I'll just leave you to it, then,"" Malfoy replied.

""Draco, you should stay. I've been meaning for you to learn more about the actual adoption process,"" Jeff said.

It took a while to fill out all of the paperwork, but once they did, Jeff said, ""perfect. Now there's just the home visit and you'll be all set.""

Harry looked over at Malfoy and Malfoy looked at him, both realizing at the same time what a bad idea it was to have a muggle come to his house.

""I'll do it,"" Malfoy volunteered quickly.

""Your shift is almost over,"" Jeff said, looking at the clock on the wall. ""I can take care of it.""

""That's alright,"" he said. ""I don't mind. We're old,"" he broke off, glancing at Harry, ""friends,"" he finished a bit awkwardly. ""I'm helping him make sure he has everything he needs anyway.""

The other man nodded, ""If you're sure.""

""I'm sure,"" he said, nudging Harry out of the office.

Malfoy helped him to buy supplies for her, laughing as Harry picked out far more toys and treats for her than he thought was necessary. The sales associate helped them to box everything up and Malfoy helped him carry everything out of the store. ""How far do we have to walk?"" Malfoy asked.

""Just a couple of blocks,"" Harry said. ""Do you want me to take that?"" he asked, offering him Penelope's leash in exchange.

He shook his head, ""It's fine."" He hoisted the box a little higher in his arms.

""Do you live near here, too?"" he asked, watching Penelope trot along tail wagging as she sniffed.

""About twenty minutes by bus.""

He couldn't help but chuckle, ""Draco Malfoy riding a muggle bus, who would have thought it?""

But the other man didn't seem to find that amusing, he frowned, ""I'm not the person you remember.""

""No,"" Harry said quickly, ""I know,"" he added. ""I wasn't trying to say anything unkind.""

""Sorry,"" Malfoy replied, shaking his head slightly, ""It's been a while since I've seen anyone from the wizarding world."" He paused then added, ""People from the past don't generally say kind things.""

Harry hummed, ""The wizarding world is full of hypocrites and people unwilling to see the wrong they themselves have done."" He shook his head, ""It's a lot. It's why I left.""

He nodded to the door ahead of them, ""This is my house,"" he added.

""It's nice,"" Draco said.

""Thanks,"" he grinned as he opened the door. ""Sorry, I didn't realize that I would be having company or I would have cleaned up a little more,"" he added as he let Malfoy inside.

He took the harness off of her and let her investigate her surroundings.

""Did you say that you aren't expecting company?"" Malfoy asked.

""Yeah,"" Harry said, keeping one eye on the dog as he started setting up her little bed and basket of toys.

""But it's your birthday,"" he said.

""Yeah,"" he mumbled.

Malfoy stared at him for a long moment before clearing his throat, ""Do you have a back yard?""

""Yes,"" he said, glad for the change of subject, ""This way,"" he added, nodding toward the back door. ""It's fenced in but it's not very big, I'll take her on walks,"" he hastened to add as he opened the door. Penelope wandered out and started sniffing around and something warm unfurled in Harry's chest just watching her.

The other boy glanced out the door and nodded, ""This is fine, it passes the inspection.""

""Good,"" Harry said, breathing a sigh of relief. ""Come on, Penny,"" he called and the little dog perked her head up and came dashing across the yard and back into the house.""

""Penny, huh?"" Malfoy asked with an amused little smile.

""For short,"" Harry nodded.

""I like it,"" he said as they turned and headed inside. ""Well, I'll get out of your hair-""

""Do you want to stay for dinner?"" Harry asked without really thinking about why.

Malfoy's brow furrowed, ""Do you want me to?""

He shrugged one shoulder, ""Only if you want to."" When Malfoy didn't reply immediately he shook his head, ""Never mind, it's silly. I don't know what I was thinking. I'm lonely, ignore me.""

""No. I'd,"" he swallowed, ""I'd like to stay for dinner, if you wanted. I just couldn't imagine that you'd want..."" he trailed off.

""We're not the boys we were,"" Harry said, holding out a hand, ""Harry Potter.""

After a heartbeat Draco reached out and clasped his hand, ""Draco Malfoy.""

""Do you like pizza?"" Harry asked.

He nodded, ""As long as you don't put peppers on it.""

""Done,"" he replied as Penny came over and put her paws up on his leg. He scooped her up and smiled, thinking for the first time in a long time that maybe everything was going to turn out alright."

Happy Birthday, Harry Potter


Harry trudged from the marquee to the Burrow, exhausted and ready for the wedding tomorrow to be over.  Mrs. Weasley had had them fetching and carrying for three days straight. The sun had slipped below the horizon hours ago and would be cresting the horizon again all too soon. He wanted a hot shower and bed. He would have liked to have seen Ginny, too, just for a few minutes, but she'd finished her tasks and disappeared thirty minutes ago. She was probably already in bed and sound asleep. Not to mention, he'd broken up with her.

""Thank you, Harry, dear,"" said Mrs. Weasley when he stumbled through the back door. ""Go on up to bed. You're the last one.""

""You, too, Mrs. Weasley. You need to get some rest as well.""

She smiled at him. ""I think, since you're of age now, you ought to call us Molly and Arthur.""

""That's right,"" agreed Mr. Weasley, his arm slipping around his wife's shoulder.

Warmth spread through Harry. They'd always treated him as part of the family, but this was just proof, he guessed. ""I, well . . . I dunno. Thank you, but . . .""

""No, buts. Happy birthday again. Now on up to bed with you."" She waved her hands at him and said, ""Shoo.""

""G'night, Mrs.--""

Mrs. Weasley tutted at him.

""Molly . . . Arthur,"" he corrected himself with a nod to each of them. ""See you in the morning.""

Ron's heavy snoring filled the room when Harry entered to retrieve clean clothes and his toothbrush. Harry was glad. After six years of being roommates, he always fell asleep much more quickly and easily to the rhythmic sound of Ron's snores.

Fifteen minutes later, he was clean, if a bit achy from all the manual labor he'd done. Stepping out of the bathroom, he smiled in pleased surprise to see Ginny leaning against her closed bedroom door. Long tanned legs flowed from beneath her over-sized Gryffindor tee-shirt which hung mid-thigh. Her breasts caught his attention, high and firm on her chest. He'd spent many happy hours fondling them, kissing them, licking and sucking them. His tackle reacted accordingly and he shifted from one foot to the other.

""Hey,"" she whispered, pushing herself off the door and wrapping her arms around him. Those wonderful breasts pressed into his chest with only two thin cotton layers between them.


Hel-lo. . . .


""Happy birthday,"" she said, her voice low and her breath warm, feathering across his ear. A tremor rolled though him. He never expected to feel her in his arms again anytime soon, considering he'd broken up with her almost two months ago.

His arms slid around her shoulders. ""Thanks again. What are you still doing up?"" he whispered in reply, nuzzling her neck and inhaling the scent of soap and flowers. How he loved that smell. His body--well most of his body--relaxed.

""Waiting for you, of course,"" she murmured, rising on tip toes and pressing kisses against his mouth, jaw and neck. Her tongue made wet circles on the slope between his neck and shoulder and his breath hitched a bit. She knew how much he liked that. What was she up to?

""Whatever for?"" His hands slid to her waist and felt the rough texture of her knickers through the thin fabric of her sleep shirt. Must be lace. Not that he'd seen or touched her knickers first hand. At least not on her. But he'd seen her clean, folded undergarments in the piles of laundry Mrs. Weasley delivered on a daily basis.

""To give you your birthday present.""

It wasn't what she said, but the way she said it. Blood trickled southward, causing a certain part of his anatomy to expand inside his clothes. He ignored it and said, ""You gave me a new set of seeker's gloves at breakfast.""

""That was for the benefit of the family. I have something else for you.""

His tackle continued to twitch and stretch, but he remained still. ""Oh?"" he said, his voice an octave higher than he would have liked. Warmth stole across his face.

The corners of her mouth tipped upwards and the look in her eyes sent a steam engine of desire roaring through him.

His full-fledged stiffy forced itself upright. ""I can't, we can't . . . I mean, you're not of age yet.""

She shut him up with a quick but thorough kiss that left him wanting more. ""Is that really your objection?""

He huffed. ""Hell, no."" Brilliant, Harry. Your ex-girlfriend is offering herself up to you and you're making excuses. ""It's just that there's no room in this house that doesn't have at least one person who's not us sleeping in it."" Not only were all the Weasleys home, but Fleur's parents were staying at the Burrow, as were he and Hermione.

She shrugged. ""So we'll go outside.  There are plenty of places we can hide.""

""Your mum and dad are still downstairs.""

She turned around and grabbed something from one of the many crannies along the staircase. He took the opportunity to adjust himself, but only gained a modicum of relief.

A moment later, his invisibility cloak hung from the crooked forefinger of one hand and a miniature bed sat on the upturned palm of the other. A sexy grin lit her face and a gleam sparkled in her eyes.

Harry was completely and utterly lost. And hard as an effing stone.

He was a fool. He'd broken up with her for good reason. Now was certainly not the time to make up and make her a target.


But who was going to know. . . ?


Cupping her cheek and brushing a thumb across it, he said, ""Gin, we don't have to do this. I appreciate the thought. I do. And I want you more than you can possibly imagine. But we both know that in a day or two, I'm going to be gone and for who knows how long.""


Another reason why he'd broken up with her. And she'd understood.


""Which is exactly why I want this,"" she murmured.

""Are you sure?"" He was mad to even consider it.

Her gaze bore into his. Her eyes darkened and she finally nodded. ""I'm sure,"" she said, her voice husky.

""Do you have your wand?"" he asked.

She nodded and grabbed it from the same cranny and handed it to Harry.

With a small tap, Harry muttered, ""engorgio,"" and the cloak grew by a couple of feet. ""Perfect."" He traded Ginny her wand for the cloak and swung it around and over himself, holding out one side of it. ""Come on. We'll have to go slow.""

Ginny nodded and tucked up next to Harry who enclosed them in the silky shimmery fabric.

Step by slow step they descended the stairs. Harry hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would stay downstairs for a few more minutes. It was tricky enough to pass people on the stairs when you could see them. It would be impossible if one or more people were trying to remain invisible.

He breathed a small sigh of relief when he and Ginny finally reached the ground floor. Now to get outside. Soft slow music floated in from the sitting room and Harry smiled when he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley slow dancing. He smiled even wider when he noticed the back door was still wide open. Just a few feet and a few moments later, they were free.

Harry hustled them a bit further from the door and out of view of the windows before pulling off the cloak.

""We did it,"" Ginny whispered. ""Come on. I know just the place."" She took hold of his hand and pulled him along. There was no moon and the further they went from the house, the less light there was.

""Where're we going?"" Harry asked.

""Well, I thought the orchard would be nice, but it's full of a marquee at the moment, so how about Dad's shed?""

He nodded though she probably couldn't see him and said, ""All right.""

The full measure of what they were about to do hit Harry. He stopped and tugged her to a halt. ""Ginny, wait.""

She turned. ""For Merlin's sake Harry. Do you want to shag me or not?"" she asked, testily.

He sighed in frustration and grabbed both her hands. ""It's not that. I just don't want you to regret that this isn't your wedding night or something more romantic.""

Her rigid stance softened and she threw her arms around his neck. ""All I need is you, Harry.""

Pushing open the shed door, she lit her wand. She murmured something Harry couldn't make out and the shed expanded, leaving a large empty spot on the dirt floor. Then she set the doll bed down in the center and pointed her wand at it. ""Engorgio."" The bed grew until it was slightly larger than Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's double bed. ""Put a few protective spells around us, would you?"" she asked.

After casting muffliato and confundo, Harry wasn't sure what to do next. They'd come here with the express purpose of shagging. Something they'd never done before. He'd always expected their first time to just happen as a natural progression from an intense session of snogging.

He shoved his hands in his front pockets and rocked back and forth on his feet.

""Harry, relax. . . ."" Ginny looped her arms around his neck again. ""Let's just snog for a bit, all right? If it happens, it happens and if it doesn't, it doesn't.""

""I don't have any Johnnies.""

""Any what?""

""Er . . . protection, contraception, something to keep you from getting up the duff.""

""Oh, not to worry. I've been taking the potion since we first started going out."" At his raised brow, she added, ""Just in case. It's no secret how I feel about you and I thought we'd have done it by now.""

""You must be disappointed then. I mean the Chosen One is going to face down the darkest wizard of the age, but he hasn't yet lost his virginity.""

""Don't be that way."" She pushed at his chest and he had to take a step back or lose his balance. ""I'm not disappointed at all.""

""Then why the last-minute plan to take it?""

""Harry,"" she chided. ""I love you. I've loved you since I was eight years old. You're leaving any day now to be gone for who knows how long. You can't even guarantee that you're going to live through it. Forgive me if I want to know what it's like to make love with you.""

Harry hung his head, reaching out for her and pulling her close, breathing in her smell again. ""Gin, I'm sorry. I'm on edge. I have to do this thing and I don't want to leave you. But I just don't think I can do this. Not like this.""

She tightened her arms around him, ran her fingers through his hair. ""All right. It's fine. Let's just lie down and snog and cuddle. That's it. I promise.""

He nodded and followed her to the bed, curling himself around her and burying his face into her neck and hair. He was going to miss that smell. More than any other scent, the smell of her hair meant he was home.

Ginny enjoyed the feel of Harry's warmth surrounding her, but she did want more than just a snuggle before he left. Rolling to face him, she pressed her forehead to his. ""I'm going to miss you.""

""I'm going to miss you too.""

""How long are you going to be gone?""

""I dunno."" He sighed. ""I dunno much of anything right now. Other than that I love you. If anything hap--""

""Shh. . . ."" She silenced him with kisses. Mouth, jaw, ear, forehead and back, finally coaxing him into an open-mouthed kiss. Her hands roamed his arms and back, memorizing the feel of his body, the burgeoning muscles and the smooth skin.

He touched her as well, trailing his fingers up and down her arm and along the length of her thigh. He cupped her breasts and she arched into his touch. Her nipples tightened as he rolled and tweaked them just the way she liked. Her soft whisperings of encouragement seemed to be doing the trick.

Ginny squeezed his bum and pulled him closer, smiling as she felt the hardness of his erection between them. Good; he was aroused and becoming more so as they kissed and touched. Her nightshirt ended up bunched around her chest and under her arms while Harry kneaded and suckled at her breasts. His stiffy poked almost painfully into her thigh. Her hands fisted in his hair, holding him to her, delighting in the sensations flowing from her chest to all other parts of her body.

""I think I've changed my mind. . . ."" he said around a nipple.

""Yeah, all right. . . ."" she whispered, pulling him up for another deep kiss. Her hands wandered his body again. She tugged at his tee-shirt and he obliged her silent request by yanking it off. Her mouth left a trail of wet spots as she kissed her way along his jaw and down his neck and chest.

Harry worked at committing the whole thing to memory, but it was exceedingly difficult. All his blood had fled his brain and was now concentrated in his mid-section. Sparks jumped along his skin as her tongue circled each of his nipples in turn and sucked on them before continuing lower. His toes curled at the humid heat of her mouth on his body. She licked the skin along the edge of the waistband of his pajama bottoms and both his stomach and his erection jumped.

Soon the ties of his pajama bottoms were undone and the tip of his cock was exposed. A hiss flew from his lips as Ginny's warm tongue laved the bulging head. His hands tangled in her hair as she continued her sensual assault.

At her order to ""lift,"" he raised his arse from the mattress so that she could slide his remaining clothes from his body. She stripped off her own nightshirt as well and tossed everything over the side of the bed. Then she took his length in her mouth, alternately sucking and licking. Heat and pressure built in his groin and his bollocks began to tingle. They'd never done all these things starkers and he was so turned on he could hardly see straight. The refreshing night air wafted over his fevered skin, doing nothing what-so-ever to cool his ardor. Ginny continued her task, cupping his sac, squeezing gently, her tongue swirling around his shaft.

""Ginny--"" he cried out in warning, tugging ineffectually at her hair. She'd sent him over the edge and his ability to do anything more than moan and buck into her mouth had evaporated. Her mouth remained on his member, lightly sucking until he'd relaxed and sunk back into the bed.

She crawled up and curled into his side, laying her head on his chest. He ran his fingers through her hair. ""You didn't have to do that.""

""I wanted to,"" she said, drawing lazy circles and swirls on his chest, brushing across his nipples.

""You never, um, swallowed before."" The heat rushed his face. ""That was, uh . . . nice.""

She shrugged. ""I wanted to try it. I can't say I'm overly fond of the taste, but if you like it better, I'm willing to do it again.""

Honestly, he didn't care. It had been nice, but if she didn't want to, he was all right with dribbling all over himself. But since she had, the desire to kiss her and taste himself overtook him. He tipped her head back with a finger to her chin and did so. He couldn't quite describe it, but it was somewhat of a turn-on and he deepened the kiss and explored her mouth thoroughly.

His hands traveled her body, tracing, touching, squeezing. He loved her tits and her arse. Both were small and firm and very shapely. His tackle re-hardened immediately and his breathing became labored.

As did Ginny's. Her murmurs and moans were doing things to him, making his blood boil, his heart pound, his bollocks tighten. He wanted her, wanted to plunge into her, feel her wet heat surround him, to find that ultimate little death in her arms.

He slid a couple of fingers into her body and she hissed in pleasure. She was so wet and warm as he stroked her. She responded immediately, arching into his touch.

""Harry, please . . . please. . . .""

His dick was so hard it was starting to hurt. He maneuvered her to her back and settled himself between her legs, the head of his erection pressing against her moist opening. ""Gin . . . oh my . . . fuck. . . ."" He took a long deep breath to regain a measure of control--a very small measure--and rested his forehead against hers. ""Are you sure you're sure?"" he asked softly. He thought she was, but he just couldn't proceed without checking one last time.

""Love me, Harry,"" she murmured, kissing him.

All thoughts fled and instinct took over. Her tongue danced along his. Her hands touched every place they could reach, sending ripples of electricity rolling through him. He rocked against her and it felt better than anything he'd ever experienced. Harder and harder, he pressed against her, his dick dipping deeper and deeper into her body.

Hooking her heel behind his knee, she nudged him forward. Tearing her mouth from his, she breathed, ""Fuck me, Harry,"" and tugged him forward, forcing him to completely enter her. A jolt of lightning zinged from his midsection to the tips of his head, fingers and toes. A groan tore from his throat and he stilled. His whole body tingled and if he moved, he'd explode. He'd barely heard Ginny's gasp beneath him.

""What's wrong?"" Ginny asked.

""N-nothing.""

She rolled her hips up, taking him in even farther.

""Gin--"" His jerked into her erratically once, twice and exploded. His head dropped to her shoulder, heat rushing to his face. Shite, he'd gone off before they'd even really gotten started. ""I'm so sorry."" But damn it had felt so fucking good.

""It's all right,"" she soothed with both her voice and her hands.

""No, it's really not...we'll do it again. Better. I promise. Just give me a few minutes.""

~

He lay in her arms, his head on her chest, listening to the steady thump of her heart. Their lovemaking--well, the second round--had been good, and he hated that it would be who-knew-how-long before they could do it again. But he had a memory to take with him now and he was thankful.

""We probably ought to go back in now. It'll be morning soon,"" Ginny said.

He nodded and reluctantly rolled from the bed. In moments, they were both dressed and the bed had been reduced to its original size. Ginny reversed the expansion charm and they tiptoed toward the house, which was now dark.

The moon had risen and its silvery light shone down upon the path back to the house.

""We'd better use the cloak again, just in case,"" Harry said. Ginny moved next to him and he whirled the cloak up and around them. When they reached the back porch, they stopped to listen, but it was quiet and they proceeded into the house and up the stairs.

Outside her door, he removed the cloak and pulled her into his arms. ""I'm going to miss you so much.""

""I'm going to miss you too . . . be safe.""

They kissed again, a slow bittersweet goodbye. He pulled away and moved to the stairs, foot on the bottom step. He looked back as she slipped into her bedroom. ""I love you,"" he said before disappearing into the dark stairwell.

~*~*~


Nine Months Later


A new day had dawned. The battle was over. Voldemort was dead.

Harry left Ron and Hermione on the bridge and headed back toward the castle. He wanted to see Ginny, wanted to hear her voice.

""Harry!""

His head jerked up and there she was, hurrying toward him, her copper hair glistening in the golden rays of the rising sun.

She launched herself into his arms and he whirled her around. It felt so good to hold her after all these months. The memory of their last night together had spurred him to keep going more times than he liked to admit. But now he was here and she was here and he was never letting her go.

""I missed you; so much,"" he said, burying his face in her neck. She smelled like smoke and sweat, but beneath that was a hint of flowers. Tears prickled behind his eyelids.

""Let's get you home,"" she murmured, hugging him just as tightly.

""Ginny, don't you know? When you put your arms around me, I am home.""

Professor Snape, Happy Birthday.Harry Potter.


Severus looked at the bottle that the small tag was attached to. It was a bottle of Ogden's Four-Wings blend. One of the last vintages of Firewhisky made the traditional way - with the magical fire provided by dragons. Two years later the Ministry had banished dragons from the Isle and Ogden's had resorted to wizard-created fire.  Which meant that this particular bottle of Firewhisky was smooth, exquisite and horrifically expensive.


Professor Snape, Happy Birthday.Harry Potter.


It was not as if this was the first time Potter had sent him a birthday present.  The presents had started arriving the winter after the boy had left Hogwarts, eighth year and NEWTS behind him.  Scarves, potion supplies, journals, dark chocolates - they all arrived in rough boxes, carried by random owls, or the odd toucan while the boy was travelling and all with the same tag.


Professor Snape, Happy Birthday.Harry Potter.


Severus didn't know why it made him so angry.  After all, the brat still sent him a gift, through an abortive attempt at Auror training, years of travelling and his return to England.  And now Harry was a colleague, and he still sent a present.  Severus had never given him anything in return.  Still, that tag!  Professor Snape.  Harry Potter.  He clutched the bottle in his hand and considered dashing it against the wall, much like he'd tried to dash a jar of beetle eyes against the boy's head ten years ago.  Then he realised that it would be a waste of very good whisky so he sat down and opened it instead.

Three hours and a lot of whisky later and Severus was considering how much of an insult it was to the honour of Four-Wings to drink it straight from the bottle.   Not that he was going to stop; since he'd accidentally duplicated his glass, drinking from the bottle was the only option.  He didn't actually remember duplicating the glass, and it was a pretty poor conjuration since his hand kept sliding through one of them, but there were definitely two glasses there and had been since he'd downed his fourth - or was it fifth? - drink two hours ago.

There was a knock at his door and Severus glared at it, waiting for it to stop.  

It didn't.

""Go away!"" he yelled, but the knocking continued.  He knew it wasn't a student - they went to his office - which meant it was probably Minerva.  Well, as soon as she saw him drunk, she would leave him alone.  He stood and staggered towards the door, but when he flung it open it wasn't Minerva standing there.

It was Potter.

He meant to tell the man to get lost, he really did, but the alcohol spoke instead.  ""Why don't you call me Severus?"" 

""Are you drunk, Professor?""  Potter shrunk away from him, nose wrinkling.  ""You smell like you went for a swim in whisky.""

Severus stumbled back to the table, picked up the bottle of Four-Wings and took a swig.

""Is that the bottle I got you for your birthday?""  Potter took it from him and looked at the label.  ""You know, considering how much it cost you could have tried to make it last longer than a night.  It's meant to be savoured.""

""Like you, Potter?""  He lurched forward, invading Potter's personal space. ""A saviour to be savoured?""

Potter's lips thinned as if he was holding back a laugh.  ""Professor, maybe you should go to bed.""

""Why don't you call me Severus?""

""You've never given me permission.  Why do you call me Potter?""

""Harry's too intimate.""  Severus lifted a hand and stroked Potter's chin, marvelling at the difference between the soft skin and scratchy stubble.  ""It makes me hope."" 

""Hope for what?""

""You.""

 

Harry knew he should step away and walk out the door, but it was too good an opportunity to pass up. He'd dropped in to wish Snape a happy birthday in person, and he had been expecting the same buttoned up Professor that he knew so well.  Instead, Severus Snape was messy.  There was no other word for it.  Messy and amorous, if the way he was draping himself around Harry was any indication.

Still, the look of naked need on Snape's face when he said that single word brought Harry's guilt back.  It was one thing to have a giggle at a drunken Snape and perhaps needle him about a hangover the next morning; the man would be mortified if he knew Harry had heard those confessions.

""Come on, Severus,"" he said, the name bringing a grin to Snape's face.  ""Let's get you to bed.""

""You come, too,"" Snape said, and Harry felt his eyes widen.  ""Harry,"" Snape added and his voice sounded soft and seductive.  Harry groaned; he'd wanted to hear Snape call him that for years, and it was only happening because of an overabundance of extremely expensive Firewhisky.

""You're going to regret this in the morning,"" Harry murmured, lifting Snape's arm over his shoulder and beginning the stumble towards the bedroom.

""Nuh-uh,"" Snape replied, his hand sliding over Harry's arse. 

Harry took a deep breath and told himself it was the alcohol groping, and he shouldn't read anything into it.  ""Into bed with you."" He pushed Severus towards the mattress and laughed when the man bounced.

""Undress me?""

""Let's just get you out of your shoes, shall we?""

""A lover would take my clothes.""

Harry couldn't help but smile at Snape's pouty countenance.  ""Friends just take shoes,"" he said as he slipped shoes and socks from the man's feet.  He took a moment to stare at the long toes, fighting an urge to press a kiss to them.

""Like being your friend, Harry,"" Snape murmured.  ""But want to be more.  Wanna have breakfast with you."" 

Harry was about to ask how much more Severus was asking for and where breakfast came into it, but a gentle snore told him that he had all the information available tonight.

He bustled around the rooms for a moment and left a second present somewhere where Severus would see it in the morning.  Then he traced the stubble on Severus' jaw and quickly walked out before he could be tempted to do more.

 

Severus woke the morning after his birthday with a sore head, queasy stomach, and unsettling memories of the night before.  Had Potter dropped in?  His verbal diarrhoea came back to him.  Saviour to be savoured?  He wondered how hard it was to hit the man who defeated Voldemort with an Obliviate. 

""Wanna have breakfast with you?"" he murmured, fighting an urge to throw up.  ""That was the worst pick-up line ever uttered.""

Perhaps he should just Obliviate himself.

He slowly turned his head, breathing deeply as he did so to help stave off the rebellion in his stomach.  There was a vial on his bedside table, with a length of ribbon wrapped around it and a tag attached.  He ignored the fact it was gift-wrapped and just downed the contents, waiting for the relief only a hangover potion could bring.

Five minutes later he took a closer look at the gift-wrapped vial.  He blushed, then smiled.  Then he stood to wash the stench of alcohol from his pores.  Soon after he walked out the door, an unfamiliar smile on his face.

He left the vial, ribbon and tag on his bed.


Severus,Breakfast is on me.Yours, Harry.

All the stores were decorated festively. All the shoppers were flushed from the cold and wore merry smiles. You could smell the confections from Honeydukes and the spiced hot chocolate from Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop in the air. Harry found himself wondering how just the jingling of bells and a bit of cold air could make someone feel so... warm... on the inside.

Even before Harry had come to the Wizarding World, he had always felt the Christmas Spirit. Before, it used to be him secretly staring at the fabulous Christmas tree that the Dursleys' decked from the cracks in the door of his cupboard. The dazzling lights and glimmering ornaments always mesmerized him. He had always wished so badly that they would let him participate. Now, Harry knew Christmas could be so much more! Hogwarts didn't just have one Christmas tree but twelve! They were especially beautiful this year! The silver and gold ornaments with blinking fairy lights just made the Great Hall sing in excitement! And then add the snow falling from the charmed ceiling! Harry couldn't think of a more magical setting to be in for the Holidays!

Hogwarts had given him so much of what he desperately wanted when he was younger. Christmas was just one simple thing compared to everything else that he'd come to love since becoming a student here. He had the best two friends in the entire world, Ron and Hermione. He had an adoptive family, the Weasley's, that he loved with his entire heart. But they were just the beginning! He had Hagrid, Luna, and Ginny. His roommates Neville, Seamus, and Dean. There was Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore. Remus. The Order. Even the thought of his rival Malfoy put a smile on his face.

Harry made a funny face at the thought. Smiling because of Draco Malfoy, what a laugh!

Harry puffed out a cloud of warm breath as he stood and glanced back at the shops. He had finished his shopping all except for one gift. Harry Potter was going to buy a gift for The Severus Snape.


'Why?', you may ask.


It had not escaped Harry's attention that Snape was looking more pale and grim this year more than any before. Now that he was no longer the potions professor, Harry received fewer detentions from the Dungeon Bat. Harry had been given the opportunity to see his professor in a different light. For one thing, Harry couldn't deny that Snape had saved his life so many times no matter how badly Harry thought of him. He always seemed to give, even if he was a great git the entire time. He was rude, sarcastic, and completely unfair, but he was also Harry's so called Knight-in-Shining-Armor. Harry decided it was time he gave something to Snape in return. It wouldn't be as great as saving his hide from crazy jinxed brooms or jumping in to defend him from a werewolf, but it would be something!

Snape wasn't his favorite person in the world by far, but he was someone that Harry wouldn't be Harry without.


HP-MERRY-CHRISTMAS-SS-MERRY-CHRISTMAS-HP-MERRY CHRISTMAS-SS-MERRY-CHRISTMAS



Holidays.


The word left a bitter taste in Severus Snape's mouth. He found holidays to be quite distasteful. Never in his life had he enjoyed a holiday. Maybe in another life, when he still had Lily, he would have found some happiness in the ridiculous festivities. He scowled. Those brief moments had been so beautiful... a long lost dream.

Of course, Albus and Minerva attempted to engage him with silly gift giving or social gatherings. Severus tried to not think of the headache Molly Weasley had given him by trying to get him to attend a Christmas party for the Order. Heaven forbid the woman was stubborn. Even Poppy Pomfrey and Pomona Sprout tried to infect him with their holiday cheer. Severus always ignored their attempts, declined their requests, and always returned the cheer with a glowering glare before he slinked back off to the cold, damp dungeons.

He would never admit to anyone that it was lonely.

And it hurt.

He hated this time of year when everyone was happy with their family or friends. Their lovers. Severus had to stop his tracking through the hallways and snap at an inquiring portrait in frustration. The painted figure ""eeped!"" and ran off into another frame nearby. He didn't let up on his glare as he continued on toward the Great Hall.

It probably wasn't hard to tell he was angry. ""An angry, bitter old man."" Severus muttered to himself. How cruel it was for him to end up as he was. A man with nothing and no one but betrayals, manipulations, hatred, death, regret, and a reputation that would keep away any happiness for him. A reputation that he himself keeps close at heart so that no other could touch his heart again.

Severus Snape quietly entered The Great Hall. It was Christmas Eve. What was left of the student body and the faculty were all sitting joyously around a fine table full of wonderful foods and tasty desserts. He growled softly before making his way to the end of the table. His original plan was to relax in front of his hearth and indulge in some classic literature. That was before Albus meddled with his evening plans and threatened him with having to teach that foul, insolent brat another ""remedial"" course if he didn't show up and ""join in all the fun"". Damn Albus and his twinkling eyes.

Nothing on this earth could possibly tempt him to teach Potter Occlumency again. Ever. So suffering an evening with a group of his peers and hopeless students it was.

Dinner passed fairly well without too many attempts to converse with him. Minerva was particularly forceful with her attempt to be jolly with him. Severus shot her down with an arched eyebrow. He was definitely not one for cinnamon eggnog or peppermint truffles. After a decent helping of creamed potatoes, roasted chicken, and grilled asparagus was dined upon, Severus set his serviette down with the intention of calling it a night. War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy was waiting for him after all.

He didn't see the set of eyes glancing at him as he left toward his quarters.

And that set of eyes didn't see the set of twinkling eyes that sparkled as the first set of eyes followed Severus out.

Halfway there, he was halting in his path by the arrival of an exotic bird. A green and red eclectus parrot for that matter. It landed on his shoulder and looked at him quietly while it held its leg out. Attached was a midnight blue box with a simple silver bow. ""I believe you have the wrong recipient."" Severus said softly.

The parrot cocked his head to the side and gave an oddly voiced ""Here pretty boy"".

""How clever of your owner to coo at you like an imbecile.""

""Here pretty boy, pretty boy.""

Severus sighed and removed the package from the insistent bird before watching it fly off with its vibrant feathers. Obviously the bird was owned by some flamboyant store owner. It was all the rage to have Christmas gifts delivered by exotic birds these days. Severus disliked the frivolity of it. He turned his attention to the small package in his hands. It couldn't be from Albus or Minerva. They both liked to irritate him in person.

It did come as a small shock to see his name scribbled out on the small tag attached to the gift. Why would anyone send him a gift? Who would send him a gift? Severus felt a sudden bolt of anger. Someone was obviously sending him some sort of joke. They were probably just having a laugh at him, to rub it in his face that he never receives gifts during the holidays! Albus and Minerva had given up quite a few years ago. Severus huffed and stormed down the corridor.

But who sent it? The thought alone was enough to stop the potion master once again. He stood in an empty entranceway to the dungeons staring at the package. It felt heavy for something so small. It was wrapped with care. He scowled at the small pit of hope in his belly at the thought that maybe it wasn't a joke.

His hands shook as he slowly unwrapped the gift. He lifted the lid of the small box to reveal a necklace. It was exquisite, a delicate Lapis Lazuli caged bead pendant in white gold. He could feel the warm glow of protective charms radiating off it. It was stunning.

""Professor?"" a soft voice asked tentatively from behind him. Severus turned and found himself faced with the one and only Harry Potter.

""Mister Potter.""

""I... um... I wanted-"" the boy was taking forever to formulate his sentence.

""Spit it out. I don't have all day."" Severus interrupted. Potter glared up at him before huffing.

""Happy Christmas, sir."" He said, although it was said a bit defiantly. Severus did his best to return his typical Holiday glare. Unfortunately, the brat never seemed to respond to his glares quite like everyone else. How he found it an invitation to approach him, Severus will never know. But here Potter was, now standing about a foot away from him with an odd emotion playing across his features.

""Are you lost, boy? Do you need me to hold your hand back?"" Ah. The holidays were starting to feel quite nice. There was nothing like taking some of this anger out on Albus' Golden Boy.

""Possibly, sir. I did just follow you through a few hallways I'm unfamiliar with."" Potter admitted with a small smirk. Cheeky brat!

""Why are you following me?"" Severus towered over the Boy-Who-Lived, who seemed unaffected.

""I wanted to wish you a Happy Christmas, sir.""

""You've accomplished that task. Now leave me be, Mister Potter."" Severus turned to walk off, but a hand on his arm stopped him in his track. ""I am warning you, Pott-""

""Sir, I mean no offense."" Harry said before he jumped Severus.

Severus went stone still as he felt soft lips pressed against his. Harry had wrapped his arms around his neck and was tip toeing his way up to him. He didn't return the gentle kiss, which resulted in the brat yanking some of his hair at the base of his neck. Severus growled and grabbed Potter forcefully by his rear end and pushed him against the wall as he aggressively responded to the kiss. If the insolent brat wanted a kiss he would give him a kiss he'd never forget!

Potter gasped at the sudden attack which gave Severus the perfect opportunity to slip his tongue in to the defenseless mouth. He must have indulged in some of Minerva's peppermint truffles because the sweetness coated his breath and made Severus' mouth tingle in pleasure. Potter didn't seem discouraged from his rough technique and was actively participating. Their tongues twisted together in a battle of sorts. Teeth bit and worried each other's lips. Neither of them was giving up their battle. Potter moaned softly as Severus licked his bottom lip softly. A spark of pleasure curled in Severus' belly as the kiss slowly became more gentle. Soft chaste pecks were being pressed against his face and he could feel Potter's legs wrap around his waist. Finally, their breaths mingled as they broke apart.

Emerald met Onyx. Severus never hesitated in silently casting Legimiency. Oddly enough, there was no resistance. He felt himself being pulled gently into the green depths. He couldn't find any traces of Potter trying to humiliate him. No ill will intended. Just an honest want to give... him a beautiful necklace... Severus watched how Potter had taken his time in selecting his gift. He'd gone out of his way to have it charmed by Albus. Severus pulled back, finding Potter breathing oddly.

""That felt different."" he stated. Severus snorted at the useless statement.

""You willingly allowed me to penetrate your mind. Of course it will feel 'different'."" Severus retorted. There was a moment of awkward silence between the two, but neither of them pulled out of their intimate embrace against the castle wall. ""You gave me a gift."" it was not a question. Merely a statement he hoped the Gryffindor would elaborate on.

""Yeah, I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me.""

""I've done nothing for you-""

""You still helped me out a lot, even if you give me more detentions than all my other professors combined.""

""Ever detention bestowed upon you was well deserved."" Severus replied in a silky voice. Potter visibly shivered before ducking his face in attempt to hide the rising blush. The Potions Master arched an eyebrow. ""Are you experiencing discomfort, Mr. Potter?""

""Uuuuh-""

""You don't say."" Severus interrupted before leaning in and teasing Potter's enticing lips. The Gryffindor sighed and returned the gentle kiss. Severus mentally smirked at how snogging successfully quieted the brunette. Though a snogging Potter was also rapidly becoming a very desirable Potter... Why exactly were they snogging? It was a valid thought, but the raven haired man put off voicing it until he'd completed debauched his prey.

It was several minutes later before Potter emerged panting. ""Wow!"" he said breathlessly.

""Mr. Potter, may I inquire your sudden interest in...,"" a quick nip to Potter's neck, ""me?"" The blush was beginning to challenge the Weasley red.

""Yes, sir."" Potter replied, both parties of the snog pausing long enough to look into each other's eyes again. ""Look up.""

""Up?"" Severus turned and looked up at the entranceway. A large sprig of green leaves and white berries bound by a red ribbon suspiciously hung above them. ""Mistletoe."" Harry Potter, The Chosen One, was snogging his evil Potions Professor because of a bit of mistletoe. Certainly the world was ending and the Dark Lord was becoming partial to hot pink! Severus wasn't sure how he felt about the situation. On one hand, he definitely disliked the annoying Gryffindor. Then again... he was rapidly gaining ground with the kissing.

""Happy Christmas, S-Severus."" He was whispered softly.

Severus didn't dismiss the Gryffindor's wish this time. He took a moment to study the flushed but honest face. Potter really meant it. Severus felt... happy. ""Happy Christmas, Mr. Potter."" Severus returned. The boy gave a small smile and tightened his embrace around him. He had a few seconds to think about his options. He hated holidays. He hated the parties, the socializing, the gift giving... but he, daresay, liked this. Severus reinforced his hold on the Gryffindor before wordlessly started to make his way back to his quarters.

""Sir?""

""Mr. Potter, it is my pleasure to inform you that you talk excessively."" Severus quipped with a ghost of a smirk. Potter snorted.

Twinkling eyes sparkled with glee as the figures disappeared further into the dungeons.

Finally. Finally, Albus Dumbledore thought as he stepped out of the shadows. He finally successfully got Severus a Christmas gift that he loved. Minerva was going to be so giddy to hear the news. With a flick of his wand, the tiny sprig of mistletoe flew into the pocket of his robes. Now, on to his next victi-uh-recipient..."

Just understanding the social dynamics of the sorcerer world was a challenge and he had spent his teens struggling to wrap his head around concepts that were way above his age. The only respite he had from the busy schedule of understanding the challenging reality around him was the time he spent with his godfather. No matter how much stress Teddy felt, the soft and gentle Harry was always there for him. So, it was natural that as Teddy entered puberty properly and attended Hogwarts as one of the geniuses of his generation, he was finally awakened to his desires towards his godfather Harry. Unlike many other things, Teddy never felt any doubt when it came to his attraction. He was sure that Harry was the ideal sissy wife and that his love for Harry was real. So, Teddy was confident when he confessed his love to Harry without any warning in the privacy of Harry's private chambers.

 

''Harry, I love you. I have always loved you. You have always been there for me no matter how confusing life was at times. I know that you are a submissive little bitch and that you have a wife means nothing in the grand scheme of things. I want to make you realize your place in this world, just like you have helped me realize mine. I will fuck your sissy pussy with my true male cock.''

Saying that Harry was shocked would be an understatement. It was true that the little sissy bitch inside Harry had always desired Teddy ever since he grew up to be a tall, strong, handsome, and well-hung young man. But, none of this meant that Harry had any intention to act on those lewd desires within his lifetime. Harry simply intended to love and care for Teddy as a good Godfather should. Harry tried his best to pretend that he was a manly husband and he had never betrayed or failed Ginny. Even now, despite every single cell in his body screaming at Harry to kneel and beg Teddy for his gigantic stud cock, Harry stood straight and spoke with only his perfect hourglass figure, super fat ass, soft and bouncy sissy tits, and already wet feminine lips betraying his intentions of remaining manly.

''I-I will act like you never said that... I-I am honored that you have found me worthy of developing such an interest but... I-I am n-not a s-s-s-sissy or something like that... I-I a-am a m-m-m-man... I-I am married to my beautiful wife Ginny and I will just act like you never said that... Y-Your desires are normal b-b-but you should b-be with a real girl... A-a y-young man should not waste himself on such empty... useless... things... like... sissies... They are not even real women...''

Harry could not keep playing the role of a manly man after saying that Teddy should be with someone else. He unintentionally confessed that he did not consider himself a real girl and started crying while barely managing to speak through his intense stutters. He was bowing his head to hide his sad face while his tears kept falling on the floor. For the first time in his life, Harry was glad for his short, plump, and feminine figure since the tall and manly Teddy could not see his face like this. Yet, to Harry's absolute shock those burly and muscly arms gently yet firmly embraced his soft sissy flesh in a loving hug. Harry heard Teddy's calm yet caring voice whispering into his ear as if to comfort Harry that only the two of them would ever know of this.

''It is okay. I would never choose a 'real' girl over you. You being such a sissy is enough for me to consider you a woman. Even if the best beauties of the world were to line up in front of me, I would still fuck your sissy pussy every single time. I have loved nobody other than you, Harry. I just want to make your life better. I want to put my babies in your sissy baby chambers, something that your wife could never give to you. Something that I am certain you were born for.''

Harry's mind was racing, Harry was pondering whether or not if Teddy could love without regret. Yet, at last, Harry accepted Teddy's embrace and hugged back, pressing her soft and fat sissy tits against Teddy's rock-hard abs. Harry was ready to become Teddy's woman. So, Harry instantly stripped the unfitting official clothing and robes off of Harry's perfect figure sissy body. That was when Teddy saw that Harry was dressed in clothing that would be considered too lewd even for a

 

harlot. It was as if Harry had dressed her body for the explicit hope that one day Teddy would take her. She was wearing garter belts and super-tight undies that showed off even her extra small clit dick's super tiny bulge as well as the visible lewd wet marks of her fat sissy pussy. Her fat sissy buttocks were uncovered and her super fat and full sissy tits were contained behind a bra that was bigger than even what her wife Ginny wore. Her extra narrow waist was basically being displayed just to show off how desirable of a female this sissy slut was. Harry felt no shame as Teddy judged her body like a hunter would judge his game. Harry had completely accepted Teddy as her lord and master. Harry was in full attention when Teddy spoke.

''Bend over, bitch. Your sissy pussy should have been bred by my dick the day that I first got an erection. I will make up for the years that we lost. I will breed you with my true male genes today.''

Harry smiled with her fat, soft and curvy lips glistening with healthy moisture as she responded. ''Please show my sissy pussy no mercy! Pump me full of your superior seed!''Teddy hesitated no longer, he teased Harry's body with his burly fingers and rubbed the tip of his cock against Harry's dripping wet sissy pussy for minutes before finally plunging his supermassive meat rod into Harry's cheating, lewd sissy pussy. Harry was quick to moan, but by the time she moaned, Teddy was already in full piston motion to fuck that hot, tight, and fertile hole with his rock-hard dick.

''O-ooooh! A-Aaaah! S-Soooo big! Y-your dick is sooooo big Teddy! A-aaaahh... M-my pussy was made for this... B-being stretched by your stud cock feels so damn good! I-I can not hold back at this rate!''

Teddy knew that Harry did not say those words to beg Teddy to stop. Those words were simply meant to convey Harry's feelings. Teddy felt glad that Harry no longer felt the need to hide his feelings from Teddy. Teddy was in full flow as he fucked Harry's sissy body without mercy and listened to the heavenly melody of their flesh slapping against each other. Whenever Teddy felt like it, he used his strong and big hands to deliver a spank on Harry's fat buttocks and left his beaming red hand mark there. Harry felt the impact but only pleasure flowed through his brain instead of pain. Harry felt Teddy's cock pulse in her tightening and spasming sissy pussy. They were both close to orgasming. Teddy wrapped his powerful hands around Harry's neck, yet Harry somehow knew that Teddy would never harm her. As if to prove her right, Teddy was choking Harry only to make her sissy pussy tighter while burying his ejaculating super large cock into the depths of Harry's sissy pussy. Harry screamed with pleasure with the last of her breath just before Teddy let go of her neck.

''O-OOOOH! I-I AM CUUUUUMMING! AAAAAA-AAAAH! Y-YOU ARE FLOODING MY SISSY WOMB WITH YOUR FERTILE, THICK, HOT CUUUUUUM! C-CHEATING ON MY WIFE WITH THE BOY I LOVE FEELS WAY TOO GOOOOOOOOOD! I-I AM SORRY GINNY! I-I LOVE YOU TEDDY! B-BREED MEEEEEEEEEE!''

Teddy kept fucking Harry that day, not caring how many people heard Harry's cries and moans. Teddy felt no need to hide, he was too manly to fear public response. In turn, Harry was too much of a female to ever doubt Teddy's actions or hold herself back when not ordered to do so by her master, Teddy. Their loud, wet, sloppy, lewd sex kept going until the start of the next day's classes. Starting from that day on, any time Harry was not actively in class, she was fucked until exhaustion by Teddy. It did not take long for them to learn that Harry was pregnant with 3 of Teddy's babies at once.

 

Weeks passed, Harry had fully accepted her role as the mother of Teddy's children and did not attempt to hide her visibly pregnant sissy belly from her students or other teachers. Harry was finally truly happy in his life, spending every waking moment with the man she loved. It came to the point where Harry threw away her ring with Ginny and wore the sissy slave ring gifted to her by Teddy. The ring was an ornament lewd enough to be instantly recognized as proof that Harry was a sex slave. Harry felt proud of that reputation, openly wearing skimpy clothing and currently even considering getting Teddy's name tattooed on her body. Yet, Harry could never guess that Ginny would pay a sudden visit to Hogwarts to see how her husband was doing since Harry had not written a word through letters in weeks.

Harry was currently in class, all the students other than Teddy were doing their best to focus on what was being told. Harry was a precious teacher. There were only about a handful of teachers alive in Hogwarts that actually fought against black magic and survived. Yet, the lesson was impossible to understand. Whenever Harry said anything important, Teddy ordered Harry to stop and come give him a kiss. All the students knew that there was a relationship between them, as well as the fact that Teddy was better at magic than most teachers. They could not say anything to stop the odd situation even when Teddy slapped Harry's ass and rubbed her pregnant belly while standing behind her. Just at that time, the recess bell rang. The students were glad to escape the odd situation. Teddy knew that Harry might be in trouble if the students failed to learn anything so he shared his personally prepared ''How To Defend Against Black Magic'' notes that he compiled while spending hours in the library studying while Harry gave him teachings and a blowjob the entire time. The students were filled with joy while they fled out of the classroom.

Yet, while all of them were busy leaving, Ginny was watching the situation unfold in the hallway. She could see into the classroom. She was utterly shocked by the state of her husband. Harry did not notice her, she would not notice Ginny even if Ginny were to stand right in front of her. That was how much focus Harry was dedicated to Teddy during every waking moment of her life during the recent weeks. Yet, Teddy was quick to notice Ginny with his sharp senses. That was why Teddy spoke the following words:

''Hey, Harry. Do you remember when I told you about how you would experience happiness that your wife could never give you?''

Harry answered as her fat and soft sissy tits were being kneaded by Teddy's strong hands. ''Y-yes, Teddy... I-I am so glad that you confessed that day...''Teddy kept speaking as his rock super huge hard dick was freed from his pants and rubbed against Harry's pregnant sissy belly.

''Do you think I fulfilled my promise? That shitty marriage between a micropenis sissy like you and a woman that was too dense to understand her husband's true desire to become her godson's wife instead was never meant to last. Such a marriage between partners that were so unaware of each other was doomed to fail. Look at what I have given you instead. You have a loving husband and 3 incoming lovely children instead. You are the sissy slut wife you were always meant to be, Harry.''

Ginny felt like she would faint right then and there. She only used her willpower to stay awake and straight because she hoped Harry would deliver a negative response. That was why Harry's answer shocked her evermore.

''I already threw away my ring. I am sorry for Ginny since she was just naive but... I am thankful to you for giving me a life beyond even my wildest and happiest dreams. I am so happy that you

 

turned me into a mother and a sissy slut sex slave for your own personal use only... I can imagine no better outcome than the one where I am your sissy wife just like right now... I love you with all my being Teddy... Fuck my sissy pussy, please... I want you to use me before the bell rings again.................................... ''

Ginny could not stand after that. She held onto the railings of the stairs as she walked down and away. She could hear Harry's depraved and pleasured moans all over the halls as she walked away. Even as she was exiting Hogwarts, the sound of soft sissy flesh slapping against rough, hard, strong manly flesh was ringing in her ears. Ginny knew that Harry was truly happier this way. She even felt sorry for letting Harry embrace who he- no, she- really was up until now. Maybe Teddy and Harry were simply meant to be...

Ginny did not visit them again after that day. She only came to watch from the garden of a hospital in New York as Harry gave birth to Harry's triplets. She was just an observer in their happy life from that point on, she never disturbed their happiness. Yet, whenever Ginny felt lonely, she always had a letter in the mail from Teddy, thanking her for being the guardian angel and the godmother of his and Harry's children. Ginny accepted this new life as her new normal and lived a happy life watching the person she loved live the best life that she could imagine."

Yes, its eyes were a weird shade of grey. And there were dark patches on its front leg, resembling - possibly - a snake and a scull. Luna insisted it was the Dark Mark.

""Wouldn't Malfoy's Animagus be a peacock? Or a ferret?"" Harry chuckled.

""Oh no."" Luna cooed at the cat. ""It's him.""

Harry turned around. The next moment sharp claws wiped across his outstretched hand. Blood dripping from his fingers, Harry took the cat home with him. He couldn't well leave Malfoy with the Beast Division over the holidays.

The first snow was falling when Harry opened the door to no. 12 Grimmauld Place. Kreacher made a strangled sound when he saw the cat; the cat -  from a crate the Werewolf Capture Unit had provided - replied with a venomous hiss. Muttering foul curses, Kreacher warmed milk, cut ham and slapped a piece of fish on a plate.

After one sniff around the kitchen, the cat pounced on the food. It scoffed down everything within thirty-six seconds - Harry checked the old clock. A final lick, and the cat retreated with wobbly steps under the table where it promptly threw up.

 

3.
It was a bloody mess. Bits of fish were floating in a glassy puddle of milk; the cat was moaning pitifully. It allowed Harry to pick it up and settled carefully in his lap. Harry could feel sharp bones underneath soft fur and skin. He wondered if this could be Draco Malfoy, after all, and how thin and hungry he'd be when his Animagus form was starved. Harry fed the cat bits of ham, one every minute, and he dipped a finger into a new bowl of warm milk, to have the cat lick it off with a contended purr.

 

4.
For four days the cat hid in the nooks and crannies of no. 12 Grimmauld Place. It appeared in the kitchen five times a day, punctual to the dot, begging for breakfast, elevenses, lunch, tea and supper. At night, always just before Harry went to bed, it demanded a midnight snack. On the rare occasion when Harry was allowed to pet it, the cat seemed to have put on a bit of weight. The shaving soap in the bathroom had miraculously disappeared; some dusty ledgers from the library were in disarray. Other than that, there was no sign of Malfoy.

 

5.
On the fifth evening, Christmas Eve, the cat joined Harry in his bedroom, after a delicious meal of shelled prawns stewed in dill sauce. Not exactly cat food, Harry thought. But there was the cat curled up on his pillow, watching him from slitted eyes. Harry fell asleep with a soft purr close to his ear.

Pearly morning light was leaking into Harry's room when he awoke. A body, human, warm and male, was pressed against his back; a hand was draped over his hip. When Harry turned, he found Draco Malfoy, white-blond hair and all, asleep in his bed.

 

6.
The next morning, the cat did not appear for breakfast and not for elevenses, either. Malfoy was gone. Harry sent owl after owl, even his Patronus stag, telling Malfoy he was welcome in Grimmauld Place and that dinner was waiting for him. But Malfoy did not return. Instead, two days later, a memo was delivered to Harry in the Auror Office. The memo was wet as if it had been lying in the snow, and folded three times. The paper had obviously been ripped from a book, and the writing, while elegant, was done with a pencil and barely readable.

 

7.



Potter -
thank you; it was good not to go hungry over the holidays. But please keep your obnoxious owl away from me; I have no owl treats to bribe her with. I am looking for work, any work. In regards to that I have a proposition: from what little I gleaned during my stay at Grimmauld Place, you've done an astoundingly shoddy job of managing the Black Estates. Do you really mean to squander away the Black fortune by your careless ignorance? I am offering my assistance in exchange for board and lodging and the usual fees.
Sincerely,
Draco Malfoy

 

8.
Harry still had to get used to Draco Malfoy, quill in hand, a pair of silver-rimmed glasses on his sharp nose, pouring over leather-bound tomes in the Black library. Malfoy pride, he thought, was an odd, old-fashioned trait, and yet it had brought him this: a cat curled up in his lap before the fire-place, which meant Malfoy would join him later in bed, for the more pleasurable benefits of their arrangement. Harry was slowly falling in love with Malfoy's arse and cock, even with the cat's claws, and he couldn't help thinking that he was - finally - a happy man.

Harry was excited, Auntie Petunia and Uncle Vernon had always been angry when he got a star on any of his work so he was eager to show them his starless ""test."" Though if asked, Harry would say that the only reason he did so poorly was that sevens look a lot like ones and not because he was trying to do poorly.


 


He skipped to show Auntie Petunia first and was happy when she smiled... though Harry couldn't help but notice that it looked weird. It was all lopsided and un... uneven. (He would later learn that whenever Petunia makes that face he had better steel himself for what was to come, there was no way to escape it.)


 


""Look at that! The freak finally didn't cheat on his work. Vernon, dear! Come look!"" Although Auntie's voice came out all happy sounding, Harry couldn't help but feel that something was wrong. The thing in his chest was pounding again and it was so loud that he could actually both hear and feel it, it didn't help that he could also feel something cold trickle up his back.


 


Vernon got there only moments later with a grin so wide and eyes so red that Harry could help but want to cower away from the round man. ""You still got a passing grade; that's inexcusable!"" The man spits out.


 


Harry wanted to interrupt and ask what 'inex... inexcusible' meant, but Vernon continued before he even had the chance to open his mouth.


 


""It is impossible for a freak like you to actually pass at anything! Come here boy, it's time you start earning your keep!"" Vernon then takes Harry by the arm and drags him into the kitchen.


 


That was the first time that Vernon ever purposefully directly injured Harry Potter. He was only 5 years old.


 

 


It was a normal day for Harry, he was running from his cousin during recess when he spotted a random door open. Taking his chance, Harry went into the room. He was surprised to see that it was filled with books. Harry snapped out of his shock rather quickly and went further into the room, trying to hide amongst the shelves as he heard the pounding steps of those who were chasing him.


 


Eventually, Harry learned that he had stumbled upon the school library and that Dudley and his friends would never enter the room if given a choice. He started reading as a distraction (it was boring hiding after a while). He didn't enjoy reading, but he appreciated it for the escape that it allowed him.


 


Harry was eight when he had finally finished reading all of the books that interested him (including the ones that were long and had chapters!). At least he could now ""read above his grade"" and could get perfect grades in reading (if he wanted to).


 

 


Harry woke with a groan, he was only aware that today was his birthday because he had learned it in class. 


 


""Wake up, boy!"" The shrill voice of Petunia pulls him fully into the land of the awake and out of Morpheus' sweet embrace.


 


Harry was quick to get dressed and exit his cupboard (there is no bed, so it isn't a bedroom).  


 


""Good, you didn't lollygag. It behooves you to not become lazy like your stupid, drunk father was. Now, I'm going to show you how to make eggs and bacon. From today on, it will be your chore. If you burn or undercook anything, you won't even be allowed any leftovers. You need to earn your keep, you're lucky that you've gotten out of it for so long. Watch closely, I'm only showing you once.""


 


""Yes, Aunt Petunia,"" Harry nods and watches as closely as his seven-year-old brain would allow.


 


Harry started cooking breakfast for the Dursleys the next day. He learned how to climb trees to pick fruit (and hide) and how to conserve food that year.


 

 


""You're a wizard, Harry."" The giant man who had just busted into the... lighthouse(?) that he and the Dursleys were staying at declares in a booming voice.


 


""What?"" Harry asks.


 


""You're a wizard, Harry!"" the man repeats. ""I've come to collect you and take you shopping.""


 


""Prove it,"" Harry states, raising an eyebrow.


 


""Well,"" the man starts, pausing before continuing, ""have you ever done anything that couldn't be explained? Things that happened in moments of high emotions?""


 


""There's a lot in life that I can't explain that has happened when I was upset. Like thunder striking when I'm mad. I can't explain to you how a storm works; supposedly I'm going to learn about it next year in science class.""


 


""Ummm..."" the giant pauses. ""What about vanishing things? Something that has disappeared right in front of you even though there is no good explanation for it. Or have you changed something? Like making a kneazle turn into an owl.""


 


Harry's mind briefly flashed towards what he had taken to calling the 'zoo incident,' but all he asks is, ""what's a kneazle?""


 


""A type of magical cat,"" the man replied.


 


Harry turns towards the Dursleys only to realize that magic must be true if their horrified faces were anything to go by.


 


""Now, here's your acceptance letter to Hogwarts-""


 


""Hogwarts? What's that?"" Harry interrupts.  


 


""Why it's the school you'll be attending to learn magic,"" the bearded man explains.


 


""Are there other magic schools?""


 


""Of course, but Hogwarts is the best school that there is for learning magic! Why wouldn't you go there?""


 


""I just want to know my choices.""


 


""Harry Potter... not going to Hogwarts? Blasphemy, I tell you! It's the school your parents attended, of course, you want to go!""


 


""You mean my lazy drunk parents who never got a job and died in a car crash?"" Harry points out. ""Maybe I really should try and find out more about my different options.""


 


""Car crash!"" He exclaims. ""The Potters were heroes! Died protecting you.""


 


""Lazy drunks can be heroes?""


 


""They weren't either of those things!"" The man shouts, turning towards the Dursleys, ""What lies have you been feeding him?""


 


""Nothing that wasn't the truth."" Petunia replies, her nose up in the air.


 


The man, in a burst of anger, gives Petunia a pig's snout with a wave of his... pink umbrella.


 


Harry stares at his aunt in horror. That's what could happen if he angered this man? It is a good thing it seems like the man was already on his side, Harry would have to make sure that it stayed that way.  

Who knows what else the giant was capable of with magic and his obvious strength?

 Hoping to distract the man, Harry asks, ""You never gave me a name, sir.""


 


""Oh! How silly of me. I'm Rubius Hagrid, keepers of keys and grounds of Hogwarts."" The man- Mr. Hagird offered his hand for a shake.


 


""Nice to meet you, Mr. Hagrid,"" Harry responds, shaking the giant's hand.


 


""Nice to see you again, Harry. Please just call me Hagrid.""


 


""Sure.""  


 

 


Harry was bored, turns out getting fitted for clothes is exactly as boring as the books that referenced it made it sound.


 


""Are you here for Hogwarts too?"" The blond boy asks as he steps onto the stool next to Harry.


 


""Yes,"" Harry responds, keeping quiet about his misgivings.


 


""What house do you think you'll be sorted into? I bet I'll be a Slytherin, it's the best house you know. Way better than Hufflepuff at any rate.""  


 


""I think..."" Harry pauses, collecting his thoughts before continuing, ""that learning at Hogwarts would be worth it, even if one ended up sorted into a house that they didn't want to go to.""  


 


""You must be one of the right sorts."" The blond looks him over, ""I look forward to talking with you again on the train.""


 


And with that, Harry is being taken off of the stool and is getting redressed into his old clothes and going outside; he doesn't want to displease Hagrid.


I honestly didn't plan on making Harry scared of Hagrid... but it just happened.Oops

Seeing as all my favorite authors have decided to upload today, I've decided to spread the cheer and update this as well.

:)


""Potter, Harry."" Professor McGonagall calls.


 


With trembles barely hidden, he makes his way up onto the stool. The hat is promptly placed on his head.


 



Ummm, yes.... Quite the life you've lived so far...



 



'Are you speaking to me in my mind?'



 



Yes. You have loads of potential in Slytherin. Your cunning mind and resourcefulness will serve you well. 

The hat projects into the boy's mind, sad that there is yet another abused kid in this year.  


 



'No! Not Slytherin!'



 



Why? You could do great things if you went there.  

The hat points out, the 'and your abuse is more likely to be noticed there' goes unsaid.


 



'I can't' 

 Harry replies, his mind coming up with several things that Hagrid could do to him if Harry ended up in the house that he had repeatedly warned him against.


 



Fine, if that's -



 



'Wait, what's your name?'



 



What?



 



'You can talk and clearly have sentience, so... what's your name?'



 



I... don't remember.  

The hat softly admits

.



 



'How about I call you... Eidos? I think I remembering reading that it's greek for sort or kind'



 



Eidos, that's a wonderful name. Thank you, young Harry. Feel free to come and visit me anytime. Now, you better go join your new family in 

""Gryffindor!"" Eidos declares, hoping that Harry could become friends with the other abuse victim, Naoise or Niel he thinks it was, that he had to sort into a house that they wouldn't fully benefit from.


 

 


Harry is ready to spend the night before the first potions class reading the textbook and preparing (he doesn't want anything to explode!), but Ron is quick to pull him away from his studies with a game of exploding snap saying ""only freaks study without reason."" Harry is quick to put his book away and join in on the game that Ron and Seamus were already setting up.


 







""Troll in the Dungeon!"" Quirrell yells, racing into the Great Hall just as food had begun appearing. ""Just thought you ought to know.""


 


Harry stares as his teacher collapses. He looks towards Ron... who had left a girl crying on the second floor. He takes a brief look at the teachers, none of which seem overly concerned despite the crying girl being common knowledge.  


 


""Come on, we got to go save the girl whose feelings you hurt.""


 


""Why?""


 


""She doesn't know about the troll. Come on, you don't want to feel responsible if she gets hurt because you said something idiotic.""


 


""Fine,"" Ron replies, grabbing a turkey leg and standing up.


 


That night Hermione joins their friend group and Harry couldn't be happier.


 

 


""Couldn't get on the platform? What a load of poppycock."" Snape mutters as he leaves to pick up the Weasley boy and Potter brat.


 


When he arrives he has them both grab onto his robe and apparatus into Hogsmeade. If they wanted to skip the train ride thinking that they were above it or some such nonsense, then they could walk their way up the castle.


 

 


Harry screams when he comes across Ron still has a stone, his head still facing a mirror with eyes wide in horror.


 

 


Harry yells again when word reaches him that Hermione fell victim to the same thing that Mrs. Norris and Ron had. He will continue the research that they had started together and try to figure out all that he can about what could be causing all these petrifications. Now... if only he would stop hearing that voice that seems to come from the walls.


 


--


 


In his studies, Harry learns more and his grades rise to match his new understanding of the materials being taught. He starts with Defense, as that is his main strength (and with how much he enjoys it- even though he was currently learning nothing from the current defense teacher), but as is stuck in a dead-end with no more ideas he dives into herbology trying to find a plant that could cause this which leads to him learning more about potions, which in turn drastically increases his skill in potion-making. It even gets to the point that Neville asks him for help in potions and Harry agrees with Neville offering to help Harry in his research.


 

 


At the ""dueling"" club, Neville had already told Harry of the dangers of being labeled a Parselmouth, so when the snake is summoned Harry uses one of the spells he had found in a dueling book he had read and poorly transfigures the snake into a metal rod.  


 


At Christmas McGonagall sends Harry an anonymous gift of a book filled with her favorite transfiguration spells and neat tips and tricks for using them. (He spends the day having fun with Neville and the Weasley twins.) Harry reads it all in one sitting when a nightmare wakes him in the middle of the night and he doesn't want to go back to sleep but isn't ready to go back to his research. He finds some chapters more interesting than others and is quick to wish her a quiet thank you after her class the next day.


 

 


The stress of figuring everything out got to Harry eventually, but the twins (plus Neville) were there to help him. Neville teaching Harry meditation (and the beginnings of Oclomacy) and the twins teaching him the basics of potion and spell creation (though as a result of this, the number of pranks on Malfoy and his gang increase along with those on the teachers -Harry is never suspected as the source).


 

 


Neville is the one to talk Harry into bringing Lockheart along when they enter the chamber of secrets, the twins having been called away by professor McGonagall to be told about their sister. When a rock lands on Lockheart's head causing him to forget everything, Harry leaves Neville in charge of the newly amnesiac and races ahead to face what he hopes to be either a basilisk or undead gorgon. 


 


When Harry reaches the big opening of the chamber he is met with Ginny's slowly dying body and an apparition of a boy a few years older than him.  


 

 


When Harry exits the chamber, a transfigured sword in one hand and Ginny leaning on the other with an exploded journal behind them, Harry is content. He dealt with the danger to the school and saved his friends' sister.  


 

 


As a gift, the twins give Harry an old wizarding tent that they had bought in their first year off an old man to be able to practice magic in secret over the summer.


 


""You sure you want to give this to me. Don't you still want to practice over the summer?""


 


""Of course we do"" ""Silly Harry"" ""We just want to"" ""thank you for saving our sister."" ""Besides, we think we finally finished our potion that will get rid of the trace on our wands for us anyways.""


 


Harry eyes them both carefully before accepting the small bundle from the twins.


 


""To open it, all you need to do is touch it and say,"" ""wands at the ready."" ""We weren't the ones who put this together"" ""If you couldn't tell.""


 


Harry nods, ""Thanks. I'll be able to do magic in the tent without getting reported?""


 


""Yup."" ""The tent's a wizard space"" ""so no magic done inside it gets reported""


 

 


Later Harry finds out that the twins had left him a letter inside the tent and a crate full of food that had been put under stasis by the house elves from Hogwarts.  


 


Harry spends practically the whole first month of the break in the tent transferring all of his notes into different notebooks based on subject and doing the assigned summer homework.


 


The second month of break is spent learning how to make wands (and actually doing it) seeing as the tent had originally belonged to an American wandmaker and the tools for it were there (and Harry got bored).


 


The last two weeks are spent at the Weasley's, catching up with the twins and buying school supplies. (Harry ends up buying all of his books from a used book store so that they already have notes in the margins for him to learn off of. He also ends up buying himself some better fitting clothes at the twins' request, so in the name of ""revenge"" he also buys the twins a matching set of outfits as well.). 


 


Ron is disappointed to hear that he'll be repeating the second year and therefore will be the same grade as Ginny and takes it out on Harry by ignoring him. Especially when he finds that Harry will be taking CoMC, Runes, and Arithmancy instead of just CoMC and Divination.



          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


That year, Harry sits with the twins, Lee, and Neville on the train. It's the twins that give him some chocolate to help him recover (though it is pranked and Harry ends up with purple skin for the last hour of the ride).  

When Harry learns what those creatures are, he goes to the twins who agree to help him learn how to defend himself against them (and the murderer that is also apparently after him).   

Hermione approaches Harry about five weeks into the school year, she had been forced to restart the year as a second-year so he hadn't really had the opportunity to really talk to her yet.

""How's third year treating you?""

""Fine. I'm enjoying the overlap between Runes and Arithmancy. If you decide to take one of them next year, I highly recommend taking both. I am still being forced to stay on our Quidditch team. How's being a second-year treating you?""

""Well. Most of it is review so far, so it's been pretty boring.""

""I'm sure you've been getting straight Os.""

""Mostly,"" Hermione answers. She stares at Harry for a solid moment before softly admitting, ""I'm still getting nightmares from the b... from that night. I've been avoiding that hallway.""

""Is there anything I could do to help?"" Harry asks. He hadn't expected Hermione to go to him with this, seeing as she hadn't even stopped by to visit him on the train, but it makes sense. Ron and her never really got along and she is still finding her way into a new friend group of her own (which consists mostly of Ravenclaws).

""My parents forced Hogwarts to allow me to have a magical therapist, or a mind healer as they are formally called. My parents hired someone from the magical enclave in Persia. They are world-known and my therapist actually learned 13 different languages so that they could help more people. I was hoping that you could come with me to my next meeting? I plan on finally telling her about that night and I could really use your support.""

 Harry's mind reels at what his friend is telling him. ""Do you trust them?""

""Yes,"" Hermione responds without a moment's hesitation. ""They've been really helpful. They got me access to a sleeping aid potion and my nightmares are slowly decreasing in frequency. Why?""

Harry is saved from answering by the bell ringing to signify the end of lunch. ""I'll meet you in the common room after class today,"" Harry responds before racing to catch up with Neville who had already left for the greenhouse.

The twins are the first to execute a corporeal Patronus, saving Harry from the Dementors in the middle of the first Quidditch match of the year.

Harry does it for the first time two days later thinking of his friends fussing over him and making sure he was ok after the match was called.

The next week, Neville and Hermione team up in convincing Harry to form a club and teach practically everyone (most students in the twins' year or below -the house missing the most representatives being Slytherin, though a few in Harry's year and above do end up going) the Patronus charm with Flitwick as their sponsor. Of course, as a result of this Harry becomes the go-to guy if someone is struggling with a spell and has sort of become Flitwick's favorite student and his (unofficial) TA. Another added bonus is that some Slytherins who attend his lessons give him spell books ""so that I have paid my debt."" Harry doesn't care much about the debt, but he does end up learning loads from the books he is given, like glamour charms and more spells he could use in a duel... though he is also gifted a book full of ""Ordinary Charms"" which basically is chock-full of spells for daily life. (Once he has copied all the useful bits and spells, he lends it to Hermione who beams and sets to reading it right away. If they start earning more stares for looking nicer than normal, then neither of them mention anything.)

When the fat lady gets attacked, the twins introduce Harry and his friends to the Come and Go room and give him the Marauder's Map as a safety precaution.  

Their whole group (minus Hermione) ends up practically moving into the room. It becomes the place that Harry thinks of when the word ""home"" is mentioned.

Hermione introduces Harry to the idea of an evening workout/run as a way not only to wind down and get ready to sleep but also as a safety precaution seeing as a rampaging murder was after him.  

It is on one of the few evening runs that the twins aren't with him and are instead working on a potion for their end-of-year prank, that a dog bites Hermione's leg and drags her into the wild attacking tree.

Harry helps Neville get to the hospital wing (with Hermione beside him bemoaning the fact that she doesn't know any healing spells), one history now understood, and needs to come up with a new prank potion for his end-of-year finally to compete with the twins. (His original prank has a gas potion that he had made based off of veritaserum, which also made those affected act drunk. Though it turns out that the potion only lasted a half-hour, instead of the full hour that he had been aiming for.)

The death of Sirius makes it into newspapers the next morning, not one article published mentions the hippogriff that died protecting the ""criminal.""

All Harry can feel in response to this is sad that his instincts that it wouldn't last were right. The twins end up holding Harry together that night as he cries himself to sleep.  

That night isn't the first time that the twins sing lullabies for Harry (their little brother), but it is the first time that they harmonize and use magic as they sing.

His end-of-year prank ends up being a simple potion that he had the house elves slip into the food the dinner after exams were done that made all the Gryffindors have green hair and Slytherins have bright red hair. (The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs were left untouched.) 

Sorry, I couldn't help but add my own head-cannons to this.  Hope you don't mind Fred becoming Free.

Sorry, I forgot to publish this yesterday.

When Harry is invited to go to the professional Quidditch match with the Weasleys, he declines choosing to attend a wand makers convention that takes place the same day instead under heavy glamour charms and a made-up name ""Hermes Ranger"" -a name he picked out on the spot. (He had heard of the event through the Daily Prophet, which he had bought a subscription from the year previous at Hermione's suggestion.). He also awakens a personal gift from Magic on his birthday, the ability to see and sense magic (including people's cores).

He also gets (runs away from the Dursleys) to spend two weeks at Hermione's who ""force"" him to join her in her intensive ballet summer camp.  (His legs have never been so sore, but the increase in flexibility and control over his own body he considered well worth it... even if he denies it.  He may also continue doing the ballet exercises every morning even after the camp is over because he enjoys it.)--

When his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, he petitions to get removed, though his attempt is unsuccessful. At this news, Harry takes to the chamber and (after harvesting all the scales from the dead basilisk with his friends' aid) commissions one of his contacts that he made at the wand making convention (the son of one of the wandmakers who had been dragged along who got private tutoring instead of attending Hogwarts) to make him and his friend's armor, gloves, helmet, and boots out of the scales. (Basilisk scales are more flexible and more durable than dragons are. They even provide a bit of protection against minor spells.) The first set (Harry's) is done three days before the first event. The dueling club becomes more popular as Harry teaches the spells that he learned for the tournament to anyone who shows up. Teaching and reading become his escapes when it becomes too cold outside to go for a run.

""Mrs. Delacour, Mr. Krum, I've been learning languages for the Weasley twins' future business.""

""Oh?  Why are you coming to us about this?""  Fleur asks.

""I was hoping, seeing as I've taken the language potion for both of your tongues, if we could speak in them together at some point?""

 ""I don't see why not,""  Fleur agrees.

 ""I'll think about it.""  Victor huffs before turning and leaving.

 Before the end of the year, all of them have had several conversations in multiple languages, as it turns out that Fleur also knew Japanese and Spanish, which Harry also learned for the fun of it.  (By the end of the year, the twins have also learned those languages and they are working on making their own based on mixing all of the languages that they know.)

When Harry, under a transfiguration potion that makes him look like a mermaid (that he and the twins crafted together), gets to the center of the town to find Neville as his ""lost treasure,"" he is furious. People are not things someone should own or belong to. Harry stays with them and nods as both Cedric and Victor come to ""collect their prize."" At the surface with both Neville and Fleur's sister in tow, Harry throws up the hidden meaning of this event making him sick.  

--

Harry ends up going with Luna Lovegood to the ball. She had asked to attend with him because ""it seems that you repel the nargles"" and he was curious what she meant by nargles. Luna soon becomes Harry's friend. (The bullying that she had been dealing with miraculously stops only two weeks after first speaking to Harry... that has nothing to do with the fact that the twins are now running low on prank materials.)

--

It is the night before classes resume when Fred and George sit Harry and Lee down for a serious conversation.

""I'm pangender,"" George comes out first.  ""If you could please start using they/them pronouns for me, that would be much appreciated.""

Harry blinks, ""What's pangender?""

""It means that they identify as multiple genders,""  Fred answers.

""Cool.  Do you want to change your name?""  Harry asks, accepting his friend immediately.  

Lee scuffs and leaves, ""This is ridiculous, I'm leaving.""  (If Harry starts pranking Lee heavily as a response to his bigot behaviour, then that is neither here nor there.)

""Screw him.  So, are you changing your name?""  Harry asks, sending a stinging curse after Lee as he leaves.

George only shrugs their shoulders, ""I see no reason to.""

""Ok.""

""I'm agender.  So use it for me.  Also call me Free instead of Fred.""

""You got it.""  Harry nods, ""Dobby!""

Dobby appears, ""You called for me, Master Harry?""

""Could you bring us cake?  We need to celebrate.""

""Of course, Master Harry!""  Dobby bows and then leaves.

The next morning they wake up in a huge cuddle and no one in it could be happier.

--

When Harry returns with Cedric's body, eyes pouring with tears and still trembling from being hit by the crucio curse, the students are more prone to believing Harry than they might have otherwise been.

(Harry pays for Cedric's funeral with the winnings from a competition he never wanted to be a part of and gives the rest to Free and George to give them a head start on opening the joke shop of their dreams.  The twins thank Harry with loads of hugs and cuddles.)  

--

That summer Harry sends the twins money to secretly buy him a normal-looking owl; Hedwig stands out too much. He then uses that owl, which he names Noctua, to communicate with Neville and Hermione and buy more books and supplies to help him when he faces Voldie. He still uses Hedwig to contact the twins and to send letters out to almost everyone in his defense club (at Hermione's prompting) to see where everyone's beliefs lay in regards to the man who really ought to be dead with all the fake news that the Prophet is publishing. (The only reason he still has his subscription is that he paid for the year in advance. He has no plans on renewing his contract with them.) Lovegood's paper has turned out to be quite a worthwhile investment with all that he is learning from it. He also creates wands for each of his friends for ""just in case.""

Harry never runs into the Dementor that kills Dudley, being too busy to leave the house much besides his runs (which had shifted to the morning, trading with meditation which is now in the evening instead) and ballet camp (he had found the camp free once it was discovered that he was, in fact, a man and VERY interested despite having no money). The death of a muggle by the Ministry's own ""guard dogs"" leads to more people questioning if the Prophet was lying. (What else would explain why they weren't at Azkaban in the first place?) 

--

The defense club continues with all members taking a magical oath not to tell others about the new meetings and their changed location (outside of those who attend) and not to take the Dark Mark willingly. To Harry's surprise, the club size stays mostly the same and ends also covering even more spells and tricks which Harry learns from both books and hints that Flitwick gives him in notes on tests and homework.

Over the course of the year, Harry becomes even more of a figurehead with Neville and Hermione by his side. He starts supplying balms to those who have to suffer from detention with Umbridge.

--

The detentions start without prompting, and Harry is far from the only victim.  Harry, the twins, and Hermione all get really good at making certain healing potions/balms.  (Only Snape notices the reason for the increase of people wearing gloves.  He doesn't say anything, only purposefully never mentioning it when certain ingredients from his stores disappear.)

--

When Harry is sent to Snape to learn occumacy, Snape is carefully invited into Harry mind to have a chat when he tries to attack Harry mental barriers (which are only there because of the twins teaching Harry how to build them the previous year when he started feeling like simply meditating was a waste of time.)

""There is no one here to judge you or watch your every action. No one can take your memories of being in my head, so will you explain to me why you treat me like garbage in class only to constantly go out to save my life multiple times and give me warnings.""

""I'm a spy, Potter. I can't very well be seen getting along with the boy who lived if I'm supposed to be a proud Death Eater, now can I?""

Harry nods at the reasonable explanation, ""how am I supposed to tell if you're really on my side.""

""I've saved your life several times.""

""Yes,"" Harry agrees. ""But Tom wasn't alive then to force your alliance like Dumbledore was.""

Snape pauses at the unexpected, intelligent point. ""Then I guess you will use these lessons as an opportunity to see if you really can trust me. But, you should understand that I can't change how I treat you in public.""

""I understand."" Harry nods. Shapes core never had matched his actions, constantly reaching out to him and several other of his students.  As long as Snape continued on the path that he set towards, Harry could feel more confident in reading people's cores.

During the Hogsmeade weekend right before winter break, Harry convinces the twins to apparite him to Diagon Alley where he visits Gringotts in hopes of withdrawing more money with which to buy books and gifts. Harry ends up walking out of the banks hours after he predicted having learned that he's been emancipated, putting rings and signing papers to make things official, that the Black vault (that he as the heir has full access to) is full of dark artifacts that he has already paid the bank to destroy for him, and carrying shrunken, in his pocket: a letter that his mother had apparently left for Snape, a library trunk that was apparently his mother's, a potions trunk, a trunk full of robes that seem to be his size, a bracelet that he is planning to give to Luna, a new magic tent, a bag that will allow Harry direct acres to his vaults to pull out money, and a credit card for any future muggle interactions he may have.

When Harry gives Snape the letter at their next private lesson (though most of the work is independent with Snape giving Harry advice disguised as insults), Snape ends up crying over whatever his mother wrote inside. Noticing that the tears are a private thing, Harry respectfully turns his head and buries his head in a book from his bag, leaving Snape alone for the rest of the day.

--

Harry gets summoned to the Department of Mysteries by Voldemort through Lucius' mark.  

Harry walks out of the Department with Ron's last words ringing in his head.

The following night in Harry's mind Snape tells Harry everything that he knows (that pertains to the war). Snape makes it obvious that he knows that the war will eventually fall onto Harry's shoulders.

Harry doesn't argue and learns that Snape's animagus form is a raven.

--

Harry only spends the first month of summer break at the Dursleys, he spends the rest of it with Hermione, helping her lay wards down and practice dueling in the new tent, though he does still often go into the old one as he finds making wands (especially carving the wood) relaxing and useful. He ends up taking a Jazz & Hip-hop combo class with Hermione at her parents insistence. 

Harry learns that his animagus form is also a raven.

Hermione is made prefect (for the following school year) to no one's surprise.

Continues where left off.

Warning!  There will be loads skipped over, it is for one of the following reasons:

Harry was the first to notice Malfoy's new nature.  He seemed more hesitant, more defensive.  His complexion had turned a sickly pale and his viridian core had dulled and seemed to be fighting itself.  It was halfway through the school year, only a few days before the train was set to arrive when Harry decided to talk to the expiring Snake.

""You good?""

""Never better,"" Malfoy replied with a raised chin and wavering eyes.

""You're skin and core disagree,""  Harry points out.  ""You don't need to tell me anything.  I just wanted you aware that you can talk to me or whatever.  I am a viable option.""

Malfoy stares at Harry for a minute before staying, ""Only those blessed by Magic herself can see Cores themselves.  A skill like that would bring envy of many your way."" 

Malfoy leaves and Harry only watches.

Harry had been warned that Snape was going to kill Dumbledore, but that didn't prepare him actually seeing Snape murder him. Yay, even more, nightmare fuel!

Harry's takeover of the Order is pathetically easy with all the kids plus the teachers (minus McGonagall) on his side. Harry takes his role as leader seriously and before long he's on par with Flitwick and McGonagall. He leaves Neville in charge of the school, while he goes off soul piece hunting. Harry still makes all the main calls for the war while on the run, messaging others with mostly Noctua and Patronuses. The basement of the twins' joke shop because a place to leave tips and a secret safe spot among the Order Members. 

Harry looks over his army, his friends beside him, and smiles his hands permanently trembling due to the number of torture curses he had to endure to get to this point.  

When his hand raises, the hall instantly quiets. ""Today is the climax,"" Harry declares in the voice he has developed for times like this. ""Today we have our last big battle. We will win because we've prepared for this. All of Tom's little safeguards are gone so all that's left is his death. Our spies have seen to that."" Harry spends a moment remembering Snape who he had just started to view as a father figure before he had been brutally murdered not even two full months ago after having been realized a traitor and Draco having lost his wand arm killing Nagini not even a full three hours ago. (That Patronus message had been quite the shock.) the one in him had also been dealt with (dowsing basilisk venom onto the scar which holds the foreign soul can do that, though now his scar has just become a dent in his face (thanks to Fawk's tears) ). ""We've worked hard and now we are going to stand, not only for our own lives but those of our allies and for the brightness of our future. Those on the med-team, may your magic forever flow like the water in streams and lakes and let you reach as many fallen as you can before it's too late. To those on our defense team, may your magic stay strong and remain as unyielding as the bedrock far beneath our feet. To those on our attack team, may your magic flow as swift as the wind, and may your feet never falter. To those who are on the run team, may your brooms carry you where you are needed with the burning heat of the flames to power your every movement. Please check and make sure that you have everything and are in your groups. We're moving out in five!"" 

Harry gets off the podium and goes to talk to his family one last time. He already knows that there is a very real possibility that not all of them make it out of this fight.

""Don't worry about me, most of the creatures of the forest have been more than willing to help me take down those responsible for Hagrid's death,"" Luna says with a hug.

""You'll win, I just know it,"" Hermione promises, giving Harry a swift embrace before heading off.

""I'll make sure everything runs as smooth as can be. Don't spare a thought my way,"" Neville declares standing at his full height with hard-earned confidence setting his shoulders.

""Your parents would be so proud to see you now.""

Neville smiles and heads off.

""You haven't"" ""forgotten about us,"" ""have you?"" Harry's soul brothers ask.

""Of course not,"" Harry promises his dramatic twin brothers.

""Good."" ""Because we plan"" ""on inviting you"" ""to live with us."" ""We know how much"" ""you've always wanted to just live with your family"" ""and live a peaceful life"" ""if that is possible"" ""seeing you are"" ""the Chosen One.""

Harry has to fight back tears at their declaration. ""Of course I want to live with you."" He pauses and takes a deep calming breath before continuing, ""you're family and I'll want you close to me always.""

The twins smirk. ""We'll see you after this all."" ""We have just the prank to celebrate"" ""our future win"" ""and what comes after.""

The twins leave after a hearty hug that Harry secretly hopes will never end. He has never felt so safe as in the arms of his brothers.

Luna is the first Harry feels to die as he works his way through the Death Eaters. He doesn't give himself a moment's pause (to grieve a close friend lost to war which had already taken too many) using the spell Luna had created for him turning all surrounding flowers into angry fae, attacking Death Eaters with hard-earned precision.

In his rage, he almost doesn't notice when Neville also falls, but he does and the cry he lets will echo in the ears of everyone who lives to face another day for the rest of their lives.  That cry was one filled with agony and pain; it spoke of unmistakable heartbreak and woe.  

Just as Harry is about to reach his target, he can feel his brothers filling their bond with love and well wishes before they too join Luna and Snape in the afterlife (whatever that may be). Harry's heart drops, 'No, no! They can't be dead! They were going to finally get to live together as a family after this.'  In his state, Harry is unable to dodge the 'Tincidunt Quis Sanae' coming his way. The wash of the silencing magic brings Harry back into the moment; he has a war to end.  The feeling of Neville's revival is almost lost to the rhythm of the fight.

The cry that begs to leave his lips, trapped soundless in a cage that would shatter anyone's heart if they were to ever hear a whisper of it.  The call of mourning and sadness that never breathes in the world in which it was created to be in, echoes empty for there is no greater torture than knowing that your loved ones are dying and not being able to do anything.  (The fact that he was the one to let them be leaders and important figures -making them bigger targets- makes it hurt all the much more.)  The fact the Neville has now been brought back does nothing to change the fact that all is family is now dead.

The wand that Harry wields, the wand that he made, stands strong under the might of the Elder wand. The duel is more boring than Harry was expecting it to be with his red-eyed opponent only spamming the Avada and nothing else. The fight drags on until Harry spots a way to end it. He smiles, his family that he has worked so hard to build and loved so much is gone. He spares no more than a thought to the fact that this might also kill him along with his enemy. He knows that Hermione and Neville will be able to manage the pick-up and clean up just fine without him (though he knows that they will mourn him). He can leave everything in their trusted hands. Hermione and Neville both have one of his backup journals (written in a code that no magic spell can crack) that will help them keep Britain on the right path. It also contains his will and final well-wishes, along with the speech that he had already prepared for when the battle was over (there were two versions, one for if he lived, the other for if he died).

Harry somehow knows that he'll only be able to cast this spell once. He and Snape had worked on it together, though Snape died before it was completed. Harry, without any hesitation, grabs Voldemort's arms and jumps off the nearby cliff. Seeing as it is now impossible for him to dodge, Harry casts the spell, ""Ratio Confractus Maximus."" And although he is unable to utter the words due to the spell he is under, he can feel them reverberate through his soul as he mouths them.

What happens next is a mix of both expected and not. The expected is Voldemort's sudden burst into dust, proving him dead. What isn't expected is for the spell to rebound and hit Harry in the chest. His body vanishes in a burst of light with only Death Eaters there to see his ""final moments.""

Of course, Magic doesn't like the idea of Harry dying and she knows that continuing to live in this world isn't what Harry needs.  He needs family, needs love, and support.  So, Magic takes Harry away from his dimension and places him in one of her favorite worlds.  A world where everyone has unique-ish magic all to themselves which have become known as ""individualities"" or ""quirks.""  

And if she places him near where most of her favorite people in that dimension are, then that is only because of convenience, and not because she thinks that they'll make a cute family together... definitely not.  

I am well aware of how much content I skipped over.  Read notes at top for explanation.

Most of this was written between the hours of 1 and 4 (in the morning), if you spot a mistake let me know.

Questions for you to ponder: in what situation do you think Harry will land himself in when he lands in the bnha universe?  How do you thing certain characters (i.e. Midoriya, Aizawa, Bakugou, Todo, etc) will react to him?

Harry wakes up and potter luck strikes again.

Chapter title is not foreshadowing, I have no idea what you're talking about.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Harry opened his eyes (when had he closed them?) as soon as sound began registering in his mind.  It was a familiar sort of noise, one he had grown used to over the course of the year.  It was the sound of called orders, feet hitting the pavement, grunts of surprise and pain, and heavy breathing.  Being on a battlefield is nothing new, even if the sound had never reached him he would have easily recognized that he was waking up... the heavy charge in the air and blood lust not being something that could be faked or something that Harry could ever possibly ignore.  (Ignoring things like this was something that had cost way too many innocents their lives.)  Though waking up in one is not something he has personally experienced before.

The first thing Harry does is survey his surroundings using his magic sense.  Of course, the first thing he notices is the person in front of him.  With a quick glance is obviously Snape with his familiar dark, but reaching out core.  A wine red -wasn't it supposed to be a Dark green(?) core that spoke of roughly hidden kindness and a deep care for all around him.  

Harry, within the same moment, assesses who Snape is trying to protect.  There are only four of them, thankfully. (Why doesn't he recognize any of those cores?  Are they already graduated Slytherins?  But, then why aren't they all tinted in green?  Where did they come from? Voldemort pulling in more foreign allies?)  The cores are all unique and Harry has never seen such a wide variety of shapes and colors of cores before now... though there is one core that immediately draws his attention.  The core is a bright, vibrant turquoise, the color way purer than any other core that Harry has laid his eyes upon, although all of Snape's allies seem to share that trait (if not to the same extent, though the duality of the one that is blue with red and white flakes is interesting... So is the orange one, whose core seems to be split between the person's hands... And the lavender's one one seems to be pear shaped, the two focus points being the throat and the mind -are they some sort of siren?).  The color, and its luminosity, of the turquoise one is more than enough to garter his attention, but it's the sheer size and force of it that has Harry feeling like he dodged a bullet with its owner being on his side (currently, -you never knew when deals might only be a one time thing, though Harry doubts it with the ties between Snape and their allies).  The blue-green core was like giant well that its owner was currently spreading throughout his body (and if that doesn't show that person's skill than Harry doesn't know what will, even if he does notice that only a minority of is being spread out with the majority of it clumped around where their heart might reside.) 

With his allies noted mentally, Harry scans his opponents. (He doesn't recognize any of them either.  Since when had the Death Eaters expanded enough to have so many people that Harry has yet to meet a single one of the group of ten that Snape and four others are fighting, despite having gone undercover at their base a few times?)  

Within a few milliseconds after having opened his eyes, Harry already has a map of the field in his head (a trick Snape taught him during one of their occlumency lessons) and is getting up from his position on the floor.  He could worry about where he is and what really is going on later, but for now, he needs to focus his efforts on backing up his dad. 

He keeps his eyes in magic mode, not bothering to waste the effort on switching it back as he casts what has become a signature spell of his, the ""Physica magicis clypeus.""  This spell doubles as both a defense and an offensive maneuver.  The shield's unique pale green light, compared to a normal shield's blue, blocks both magic and physical attacks and if it passes through someone's core, can stop them from casting magic for an amount of time that differs per person.   Like most spells of his, Harry can easily perform this both wandless and without voicing the spell.

Harry's first targets are the three that seem to be trying to be attacking the lavender core, seeing as they are in a straight curve.  Using his magic to send his shield in the way he wants it to go, Harry eyes the two that had been battling M. Turquoise core as they both fall, only seconds apart.  The three opponents of orange hand core soon follow his friends on the ground, and so do the ones Harry targeted, who for some reason also faint as a shield passes through them.  (Harry had only seen those with a poor connection to their magic faint after the shield passed through them.  What, had those people never meditated before?)  

The only two opponents that were left standing both had rare-creature inheritances who were fighting Snape and the white-red-blue core person.  The one who seemed to be focusing on the tricolor core, with some kind of elemental insect gift, suddenly throws a projectile at Snape... who was in no position to dodge.  The instinctual flow of magic that really isn't a direct spell and just formed based on the emotions poured into it, hits home and the projectile's momentum and velocity switch hitting the person that threw it in the chest.  They don't remain standing for long as the tricolor kid easily takes advantage of the insect's surprise.  

Harry turns his attention towards the last enemy standing, who seems to be focusing on Snape.  The rock giant gifted opponent doesn't remain up for long as Snape, using a spell Harry has never seen him use before, wraps the giant in some sort of interesting cloth that barely registers even with Harry's magic Sight fully activated.  Though the spell Snape uses seems to be a less magically enhanced version of the three-color-core person's last take down.

Harry finally switches his sight to what it normally is out of battle, after checking to making sure that all of the enemies are out for the count of course, his black world with white outlines with magic being the only color source shifts to a world full of colors, though the core can still be faintly seen, glowing in each person's body.  

""You good?""  A deep voice asks in Japanese from where Snape was only moments ago.

Harry looks at the speaker and realizes that it was coming from whom he had assumed to be Snape... and startles, the man in front of him was obviously not Snape.  

warning, this has not been proof read.

Sorry this is so short, I've been busy with my life irl.

Thought I should post this, as a celebration for my readers seeing as today is my birthday :)


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Harry finally switches his sight to what it normally is out of battle, after checking to making sure that all of the enemies are out for the count of course, his black world with white outlines with magic being the only color source shifts to a world full of colors, though the core can still be faintly seen, glowing in each person's body.  

""You good?""  A deep voice asks in Japanese from where Snape was only moments ago.

Harry looks at the speaker and realizes that it was coming from whom he had assumed to be Snape... the man in front of him was obviously not Snape. 

 

 He looked more like a secret love child of Snape and Sirius with his long, wavy, black hair, high cheekbones, slight beard, and dark onix eyes that speak of tired, hidden compassion and wariness that Snape always had and most people grew to have during the war.  Though the eye bags that Snape would have concealed are out on full display, an exposed ""weakness.""  

""You there?""  Not-Snape asks, not unkindly.

Harry opens his mouth to reply a simple, ""yes. Would you mind telling me where I am?"" But no sound comes out.  It is when Harry is looking back through his memories to see if he at some point got hit with a silencing charm that Harry remembers the final battle... and that Snape is dead.

""Are you unable to talk?""  The man asks the four people (in the area) who are not-Snape have core connections to gather around.  All of them are teenagers, about four or five years younger than him, excluding Not-Snape who looks to be in his early forties (though Harry wouldn't be too surprised if he was actually at least a decade younger.  War has a way of aging people.)

Harry shakes his head in agreement.  The spell that he is under can only be undone by a specific counter curse that can't be done by the person under the spell.

""The police have been called to pick the villains up and take our stories,"" Lavender says, drawing Harry's attention to him.  Lavender has dyed his hair a purple shade to match the contacts that he wears.  The eye bags under his eyes almost match Harry's but are less than Not-Snape.

""Are you ok?""  Turquoise asks, looking Harry up and down, not even pausing at his famous scar which is as relieving as it is worrying.  

Harry sighs and directs his magic to answer the question, with the help of his wand as delicate magic work has never been his strong suit, that he has been asked twice now, in Japanese as it seems that is this group's preferred language.  ""I'm ok.  Could you tell me where I am?""

The teens of the group all seemed startled at his floating letters, though the adult just blinks and answers, ""You're in Musutafu.""

Harry tilts his head, ""in Japan?""

The adult just gives Harry the most blank-eyed look that he has ever seen.  The police arrive before anything more can be said.  Harry allows himself to be driven to the station with Mr. Split core sitting in the back with him.

The police station is exactly like Harry was expecting it to be, though the fact that there was a creature inherited there was a surprise.  

""Hello, I'm Detective Tsukauchi.  My quirk is lie detector.  I'll be the one to ask you the questions as soon as my paperwork comes through.  I'm going to go check up on it and be back shortly, Eraserhead will stay with you.""

Harry nods as not-Snape enters the room and the detective leaves.  With such a kind core in the room with him, he allows himself to enter his mind and reflect on all that has happened.  (The only reason he had yet to break down was his occlumenacy and this experience in the war.) 

I'll try and get something more written for you all soon so keep an eye out."

My name is Emilia Thompson and I am a loser. Well, in my own eyes, anyway. I have to wear ponchos and jeans in every season because my skin is sensitive to the sun, I'm the daughter of a primordial goddess of night, which should be cool, but my best friend's an Apollo kid (ironic, huh?), so I'm a misfit in my own family. I was raised by my mother in freaking TARTARUS, so I have very limited social skills, I got to camp when I was 15 (I'm still 15), and my dad is a neglectful jerk. Well, I think that's the full disclosure. Onward we go to the story.

See you later, reader. Stay connected.

""Emi?"" I hear Jennifer's voice echo through my cave. ""Would you please turn on the lights or something?""

""Sure,"" I say quietly. ""I'll summon a star."" There's a flash and a glowing orb of light appears in my hand. ""Does that work for you?""

""Yeah,"" Jennifer smiles. She carefully steps over the blue and purple bean bags in the middle of the room. ""Get dressed. Chiron needs you.""

""Fine,"" I grumble. ""Can you wait outside, though? A girl needs her privacy.""

She nods and leaves, stopping at the entrance and closing the heavy blue curtain behind her.

I grab a silky black button-down shirt, fasten it up, and pull on some ripped jeans. A poncho goes on over the shirt, and a pair of combat boots go on my feet. My signature blue gloves are slipped onto my hands, along with a delicate tanzanite bracelet that I got from Nyx. I don't want to bother with my hair, so I just run it through with a brush and yank a hat over it. Finally done, I walk outside to where Jennifer stands in a simple but elegant bohemian outfit. Her hair is done up in a messy braid, a few wavy strands framing her face. How did I get such a pretty best friend?

She smiles and grabs my arm. ""Come on, Short Stack. We can't keep Chiron waiting.""

""Fine, J. Let's go, it'll be nice to get it over with."" I roll my eyes jokingly. ""Let's see what he wants from me.""

As we approach the Big House, Percy waves at us and jogs over. ""Hi, guys! What're you doing?""

""Sorry, sodium skull,"" I quip, ""No time to talk. Chiron needs me.""

As we walk away, Jennifer laughs. ""Sodium skull? That was a good one. Annabeth-worthy. And she's hard to beat.""

""Oh, there you are, Emi!"" Chiron trots up to us. ""Come inside. One of your sisters wants to speak with you.""

We walk inside and I see the most unexpected person sitting primly on the couch.

""Hecate?""

""Hello, Emilia."" She smiles. ""I'm sorry if I interrupted your sleep schedule, but I have something important that I need you to do.""

""My name is Emi."" I snap. ""What do you want anyway?""

""Emi, dear, why are you acting so cold?"" Hecate looks at me with a (definitely fake) smile and continues in a honey-sweet voice. ""I'm here because I have a mission for you. See, about two thousand years ago, I created a race of humans with extra abilities, called wizards. They've been living without me, and there are some problems.""

""What kind of problems?"" I glare at her.

""One of their number has gone dangerously wrong--so terribly that I fear he might wipe out the entire wizarding population. There is only one person who can defeat him, and that person is only a teenager. You have been assigned to protect him. There is a book series that predicted this happening, although it's set in a different time period. Harpy Pooter, I think it's called?""

I laugh, confused. ""You want me to protect Harry Potter?"" I shake my head. ""Impossible. He's fake.""

""He's as real as you are, baby sister."" Hecate corrects me. ""And a million times more stupid. I will give you information on the wizarding world, knowledge of all spells, the ability to speak Latin, and your wand.""

I giggle at her remark on Harry. ""Well, I can't argue with that."" My face hardens a bit. ""But I have one request.""

""What is it?""

""Jennifer has to come with me,"" I demand. She starts to protest, but I interrupt. ""She can heal people--she's a top tier doctor--and she's a talented fighter. I've seen her with a bow. She's terrifying.""

""Fine, she may accompany you,"" Hecate mutters a curse under her breath. ""I don't understand how you two can be friends, though.""

Jennifer laughs. ""Yes, we are a very unlikely pair. I mean, Emi's the literal embodiment of darkness and I'm the child of the freaking Sun.""

""Well, girls,"" Hecate sighs, ""I give you my blessing. Now, you'll each find a backpack in your respective cabins or caves. They will have your supplies.""

A rush of bubbly warmth flows through me, settling into my muscles and filling me with a confident feeling. ""I'm just going to shadow travel to my cave--I need to get some stuff from my trunk."" I pull some shadows from the corner and they sink into my skin. There's a cool breeze and I stumble out of the corner of my dark cave, collapsing onto the bean bags that cover the floor. Sure enough, there's a backpack on my bed, pitch black with silver stars.

I unzip it and inside I find a black and violet wand, a journal that depicts the night sky, a tanzanite circlet that matches my bracelet, and a small leather pouch. I put the circlet on my head after taking off my beanie, open my trunk, pull some extra ponchos out, and put them in the (seemingly endless) backpack. I grab some black slacks and white shirts and drop them in the bag as well.

When I've finished packing, I shadow travel back to the Big House, where Jennifer stands, holding a white backpack and wearing an amber circlet almost identical to mine. She waves and smiles at me. ""Hey, we match!""

""Hey, J! What's your wand look like? Mine's pretty cool."" I smile back.

She pulls a simple, light brown wand out of her pocket. ""Mine's a bit boring, but it feels right."" She unzips her backpack and pulls out a pouch and journal. ""What does your stuff look like?""

I grab my journal and coin purse. ""Mine is my cabin's respective colors. Makes sense.""

""Ah, you're ready."" Hecate steps out from the shadows. ""The circlets are a form of communication between you two, as are the journals. Emi, your wand is ebony wood with a core of Dementor cloak thread. Jennifer, yours is maple wood with a core of Granian Pegasus hair. Both are very powerful. Use these wands well.""

I smile. ""We will, Lady Hecate.""

""Yes,"" Jennifer agrees, ""We most definitely will.""

""Emi, can you shadow travel somewhere with just a picture of the location?"" Hecate asks. ""It's time for you to go, and we don't have time for a full geography lesson.""

I nod. ""I can do that, but it's a bit unreliable--can I have a name and city?""

""The Leaky Cauldron, in London. I believe you know where that is."" Hecate winks.

""Yep."" I agree. ""Jennifer?""

""Yes?"" She looks up from her Valdezinator(tm) phone.

I grab her arm. ""Hold on.""

""Wha--AHHH!"" She screams as we're sucked into a vortex of stars. ""Emi! Why did you have to do that?""

We appear in the corner of a musty pub. There are tables arranged haphazardly around the room and stairs leading up to what's probably a bunch of hotel rooms. I turn and see a young, handsome man with golden hair beckoning us over. I tug at Jennifer's arm and walk over.

""Hello, Emi Thompson and Jennifer Vanderkindren. My name is Ploutos, but you should call me Preston--I'm undercover. I'm here to guide you to your current residence."" He seems to remember something. ""I also need to take you to get your supplies.""

""What supplies?"" Jennifer tilts her head, confused.
--------------------------------------------LiNe BrEaK------------------------------------------

It's been five hours of grueling shopping and I'm carrying a massive tower of books, robes, vials, and potion ingredients, courtesy of Ploutos. Jennifer is carrying two cauldrons, a cat, two owls, scales, and two telescopes also paid for by the god of wealth.

""You know, you could just put those supplies in your backpacks."" Ploutos deadpans. ""It's not that hard.""

I roll my eyes. ""Maybe for you. You're a literal freaking god.""

He smirks. ""And you're a demigod with more power than I have. Your mom's a primordial.""

I raise my right index finger in the air. ""Point. I'll just use umbrakinesis."" I lead the others into a dark alley off Diagon and summon shadows to pick up all of the supplies in Jennifer's and my arms. One by one, they're divided evenly into the two backpacks. I smile in satisfaction and brush my hands off on my poncho. ""Now, where to?""

""Wait."" Jennifer holds up her hand and says something in Greek.

""Are you going to make me rhyme? Oh, heck no. Not this time."" Ploutos blanches.

""What did you do?"" I ask, looking back and forth at the god and my best friend.

""Rhyming curse."" She shrugs. ""It's an Apollo thing.""

""I almost feel sorry for him. Almost."" I smirk. ""Now, Preston, where are we staying until the school year?""

He sighs. ""I regret telling you to call me that--I'd rather be stabbed in the face. Anyway, we'll be apparating to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.""

I smile. ""Nice. I should've known it was going to be his fifth year. Such a cliche. It happens in every fanfiction."" I look up at your face in the sky. ""Right, reader?""

Jennifer looks at me, confused. ""What did you say?""

""Never mind."" I shake my head. I must be the only one who sees you. ""Shall we go? I'm interested to see what Harry looks like.""

Ploutos smiles. ""You'll be surprised about their looks. Especially Hermione, the one who loves books.""

""Well,"" I say, ""The books never said she was white, so I probably won't be shocked. Now, let's go.""

Jennifer takes a step back. ""They didn't?"" She smacks herself on the forehead. ""Of course they didn't. I'm being a seaweed brain.""

I laugh. ""Now is Percy's cue to jump out of the sky and yell, 'WHOMST HAS SUMMONED THE ALMIGHTY ONE,' But he's probably making out with Annabeth and didn't get the signal.""

Ploutos sighs, grabs our shoulders and spins on his heel. There's a twisting sensation in my gut and I feel like I'm being turned inside out and pulled through a rubber tube. After about two minutes in this looping, stretching, twisting tunnel, we all pop out in front of a ramshackle row of townhouses. There's a number eleven and a number thirteen, but number twelve, Grimmauld Place is nowhere to be found. Naturally.

Ploutos pulls a slip of parchment out of his pocket and hands it to me. ""Memorize the note to the very end and then hand it to your friend.""

I take the parchment. It's about four inches by six, with flowy handwriting across the middle. It reads: ""The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."" I scan it twice (it takes forever, though. Dyslexia sucks), take in the address, and pass it over to the brunette next to me. ""Here.""

""Thanks, Em."" She takes a glance at the parchment and hands it back to Ploutos. ""Let's go.""

Now, where there was nothing before, a grimy and dark house with almost no windows whatsoever stands. The door is nearly hanging off its hinges, though it had obviously once been very grand, once upon a time. We approach the house and Ploutos slips inside, saying something indiscernible (but undoubtedly rhyming) to someone in the hallway. He beckons us in. I, naturally loving the dark, step in first and immediately see a matronly woman beaming at me.

""Hello, dear, I'm Molly."" She pats me on the shoulder. ""You must be Emilia, one of the transfers from America. I've heard many good things about you.""

I smile shyly. ""It's Emi. It's nice to meet you, Molly."" She practically glows at my manners. If only she knew how positively demonic I can be. ""My friend, Jennifer, and I are from a branch of Ilvermorny called Media Deus Camp of Magical and Physical Combat. It specializes in self-defense if you needed to know.""

Jennifer skips up next to me, looks around, and shrugs. ""We can work with this."" She looks up at Molly and smiles. ""I'm Jennifer Vanderkindren. It's lovely to meet you, ma'am!""

""Jennifer? Emi? What are you two doing here?"" A very familiar, very short boy appears out of the shadows. He wears an oversized aviator jacket and a plain black shirt. His melted chocolate eyes are ringed with shadows and his fluffy black hair is frizzier than usual.

""Nico?"" My eyes widen. ""What are you doing here? Why have you been gone for so long?""

""I can explain.""

Jennifer looks at him sternly. ""You better.""

""Well,"" he starts, ""This is where I've been for around a year. Studying practical magic at Hogwarts. See, Media Deus was getting a bit repetitive, so I decided to study abroad.""

""Yes,"" Molly injects, ""Nico has been a wonderful houseguest. Very polite and generally friendly, though Nico, dear, you're too skinny! You need to eat more!""

I nod. ""I agree. The worst he's done was eat one shriveled pomegranate seed a day and nothing else.""

Nico groans. ""Don't remind me of that. It was months before I stopped having nightmares.""

Jennifer winces. ""Yeah, let's not.""

Molly's brows furrow in concern, but she shakes it off and smiles again. ""I'll show you two to your room. You'll want to meet the others, too--most of the kids are your age! You can come up too, Nico, if you like.""

""I'll pass."" He melts back into the shadows.

Molly leads us upstairs (there are five creaky steps) to the third floor. We follow her to the second door on the left, which we open to find an unusually clean, gray room with two four-poster beds, two dressers, two desks, and a chiffarobe.

She turns to us. ""The others are in the room next door--the one on the right. If you want to meet them.""

""Sure."" I turn my back on the beds and walk over to the door. ""J, do you want to come with?""

""I'd love to!"" She chirps. Jennifer, being the adorable, wide-eyed, sunny girl that she is, skips cheerfully over to me and waves at Molly. ""We'll be with the others if you need us.""

We leave the room silently, turn right, and knock on the door. There's a thud, a yell, and a few light taps as someone walks up to the door and answers.

""Yes?"" A feminine voice calls. ""Who is it?""

""May we come in?"" I say softly. ""We're the exchange students from America.""

The door opens to reveal an incredibly pretty half Asian girl, who smiles and steps aside to let us in. ""I'm Hermione Granger, and the boy in the corner is Harry Potter. The one on the bed is Ron Weasley. Excuse the mess--the boys are idiots."" Hermione deadpans.

""Hermione!"" Ron gasps. ""You wound me!""

I topple over laughing. When I finally catch my breath, I stand up, brush myself off, and say, ""Sorry, I just really like watching people bluntly insult each other. It's hilarious."" I hold out my hand. ""Emi Thompson. The Dodie lookalike is Jennifer.""

""Nice to meet you guys,"" Harry says from his emo corner. ""I'm rethinking my life choices and full of existential dread.""

I laugh. ""That's me every day, bro. I mean, I opened this chapter with, 'My name is Emi Thompson and I am a loser.' Don't ask about the chapter thing.""

Jennifer smoothly walks up to me and hits me over the head with her notebook. ""Self-deprecate again and I'll have you speaking in rhymes for a week.""

I don't question this and instead, continue to talk with Harry.

""It's okay,"" Harry smiles, turning around. ""I do it too. Niko's such a weird author. The situations they put me in--what is the purpose of dumping a cauldron of soup on my head, I ask you?""

Hermione looks at us with a very exasperated look on her face. ""He's been like this for months. Well, at least you two will get along. Let's go, Ron. Jennifer, can you come with us? I want to leave them before it gets too weird. I'll tell you about Hogwarts.""

""Sure!"" The American brunette smiles. ""Let's go! Bye, Short Stack!""

I smile as they walk away. Time to make a new friend. I walk over to Harry, who reflexively stands up. ""Heckity heck,"" I stare at him, ""You're shorter than I am! And I'm five foot zero!""

Harry scowls. ""Blame Niko. They also made me pan, so that's a thing.""

""Well, they made me a socially awkward disaster."" I sigh. ""Screw you, Niko. Screw all fanfiction writers."" Somehow, Jennifer seems to appear behind me, pointing an arrow menacingly at my...nose?

""Shut it or Valkyrie will hear,"" she hisses.

""Where did she get the arrow?"" Harry asks quizzically, clearly nervous.

""My dad."" Jennifer answers flatly, retreating and returning her arrow to her quiver. ""Long story.""

""I don't think I want to hear it."" Harry winces a bit. ""Do you have a weapon, Emi? It would make sense, as your best friend has one.""

""One?"" I chuckle. ""Oh, no. I have two."" I take a jewel off my bracelet and it immediately transforms into a pitch-black handgun. ""The bracelet is enchanted. I also have this,"" I add, pulling a tiny token shaped like a meat cleaver out of my pocket. I tap it and it immediately turns into an actual, pitch-black meat cleaver. ""I had them charmed so that they would be more covert. The bracelet was a gift from my mom, so I had it enchanted to turn into a handgun when I need it. The meat cleaver was from a friend, and no, her name isn't Heather McNamara.""

Harry's eyes widen. ""You know Heathers?"" A smile grows across his face. ""What's your outlook on JD?""

I grin. ""He needs therapy, but he has potential. He could make a very good hitman. What do you think of Veronica?""

He cringes. ""She needs some work. She's insecure, attention-seeking, and a social climber. She employs unnecessary tactics to lure victims, she's careless, and she's far too trusting.""

""Hold up."" Jennifer cuts in. ""I was told by Hermione that your aunt and uncle are jerks and don't let you do anything. How do you know so much about an American movie?""

Harry shrugs. ""They thought it would scar me for life."" He catches my concerned expression and explains it. ""They only let me watch stuff that they think I won't like. The stuff they think will be hard on me. Little do they know, I live for the macabre.""

""Oh, we are definitely going to get along,"" I smirk. ""My favorite film is Saw. You know, the horror flick?""

""Oh, Merlin's twitchy left eye."" Harry looks at me like I'm crazy. ""How do you survive that? It's one of the goriest, weirdest, most horrifying movies out there!""

""That's why I like it."" I giggle. ""If you're going to be my friend, you need to deal with my weirdness.""

Jennifer audibly rolls her eyes from the corner. ""Whoa, there, edgelord. You need to chill.""

Hermione walks in. ""Dinner's ready.""

My eyes nearly pop out of my head. ""FOOD!"" A true smile stretches across my face. ""I'm eating all of it!""

Jennifer sighs. ""Typical Emi. This diet can't be healthy.""

I flash a crooked grin. ""Well, we go to a combat camp, and I'm probably going to keep exercising and conditioning for as long as possible, so you're out of luck with the healthy diet. I'm going to eat whatever I want!""

As soon as I say that, Jennifer gasps, infuriated. I grimace. ""This is my cue to hightail it! See you guys downstairs!"" I dash out the door and down the stairs, Jennifer following right behind me. I skid into the dining room, where I suppose hijinks are about to ensue.

And lo and behold, I'm right. Two red-haired twins--Fred and George--have bewitched the salt and pepper shakers to fly around the room, resulting in a disaster. I, exasperated, clear my throat and yell, ""FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY, YOU CLEAN UP RIGHT NOW!""

Jennifer sighs and is either contemplating shooting something or swearing in Greek. Fred and George ignore me, busy trying to escape the wrath of Molly Weasley and her wand.

I sigh, drop the temperature in the room drastically, and take a deep breath. ""YOU NEED TO COOL DOWN!"" I yell, eliciting a few squeals and shivers.

A man who I assume is Sirius stands bolt upright. ""What was that?"" He turns to me. ""Who are you? What are you doing here? How did you get here?""

""Chill. I'm just the transfer student."" I stick out my hand for him to shake. ""Emilia Thompson. Call me Emi.""

He shakes my hand cordially. ""Sirius Black. How did you pull that temperature trick? That was scary.""

""My school does a lot of wandless magic,"" I lie smoothly. ""The teachers there are incredible. I specialize in night magic, the creepy group, meaning shadows, temperature, and all that jazz. My mother is the teacher for all students in my category, though there are few of us. It's a lonely class. My best friend works with day magic, so we rarely see each other.""

Jennifer shows off this talent by warming up the room with a little sunshine.

""Wow,"" Sirius steps back, surprised. ""That's depressing.""

""Well, you should see what Nico works with."" I smirk. ""His department is the epitome of creepy--""

""If I wanted to be ratted out,"" Nico interrupts from behind me, ""I'd do it myself. I'm my own person, you know.""

""Yes, you are."" I smile apologetically. ""Do you think you'd be in this house if I could help it?""

Nico's lips quirk up. ""Well, you can't change that--I'm here, I'm queer, and I'm full of existential fear!""

A heavily scarred man, probably Remus, laughs from the other end of the table. ""I appreciate the poetry, Nico. That was true artistry.""

""Why, thank you, Remus."" Nico laughs along. ""You, being the most 'Ravenclaw' Gryffindor here, would understand.""

""I think I'll be sorted into Hufflepuff when we get to Hogwarts."" Jennifer puts in unhelpfully.

""Where did that come from?""

""I'm very random.""

""Yes."" I agree. ""You have a random streak--""

""POTATO!"" Jennifer yells.

I squeal in shock, then shake it off and compose myself. ""I rest my case. You're a real life Patton Sanders.""

""Why, thank you."" She smirks at me.

The others are all looking at us like we're crazy. I snigger and grab a slice of bread off the table, tearing into it like a wolf into a steak.

This is going to be a fun year.

hehe sunburned draco go brrrrr

""We have to do what to get onto the platform?"" I yell at Harry as we stop in front of a metal barrier. Of course, I'm bluffing, but it's freaky nevertheless--what if he's lying?

 

        ""Wow, Emi,"" He takes a step back. ""Can you chill out for a moment? It's not like I'm going to murder you or anything.""

 

        I laugh weakly. ""Yeah. No murder. Right."" Taking a deep breath, I let go of his wrists, and Jennifer playfully swats me over the head with her wand. 

 

        ""Don't worry, I still have my bow in case I need to snipe anything."" She quietly jokes with a snicker.

 

        ""Promise me you'll shoot Bellatrix Lestrange in the face,"" I beg.

 

        ""Well, that's a given."" Jennifer shoots me one of her Apollo Smiles(tm) and takes her trolley, running into the wall. She promptly vanishes and I follow suit. We both appear on the platform, the Hogwarts Express ready to take us to the school.

 

        I high five Sirius, shake Remus' hand, and give Molly a rib-cracking hug before climbing onto the train. Jennifer quickly follows suit and we slip into the closest empty compartment. It's quite roomy, with overstuffed violet cushions on the benches. I plop down in the corner, curling up with a pitch-black blanket that I'd recently woven out of shadows.

 

        Unfortunately, as soon as I'm settled, I hear a knock at the door. ""Come in, I guess,"" I grumble.

 

        A tall, willowy boy with fair hair slides open the door and struts through. ""Who are you?"" He asks in a bored voice.

 

        I tap my circlet and send a message to Jennifer, who's stretched out across the compartment. Hey, J, we've got a Code M. I snicker. ""My name is Emilia Thompson, half-blood. You've got blond hair...a pinched expression like you've got dung under your nose...black silk robes...you must be Draco Malfoy. I've heard all about your kind. Cowardly suck-ups who spend more than y'all own."" A message comes over my circlet from Jennifer. 

 

        Flip him off for me. Please.

 

        Will do.

 

        He gasps in indignation, both from the sudden flipping off and the insult. ""Excuse me, but who do you think you are to be speaking to me this way? My father will hear about--""

 

        I roll my eyes. ""Yeah, sure. I've heard that little speech a hundred times. My mother is more powerful than all of you pureblood prats combined. Don't mess with me."" I lower the temperature by a couple of degrees and the shadows creep up to pool behind me in a swirling mass of black. Draco whimpers and dashes off. Success.

 

        Meanwhile, Jennifer is attempting and failing to suppress her laughter. She lets loose a gale of airy giggles, clutching her sides like her hands are the only things holding her together. ""My father will hear about this."" She mocks, hardly stopping laughing long enough to speak. ""Oh, look, I'm a Malfoy. I'm so important."" The brunette snorts. ""At least we don't have to deal with him. Dibs on scaring him in the next confrontation.""

 

        ""You gonna sunburn him?"" 

 

        ""Maybe."" She shrugs. ""Or I'll curse him to speak in rhymes for a day.""

 

        I snort loudly. ""I'd pay to see that."" I pause. ""Try not to impale him with a beam of light.""

 

        ""Ooh, yeah."" Jennifer bends the light to make herself invisible and vanishes from view. She only reappears when the train comes to a stop, clearly exhausted. 

 

        ""Careful, you might pass out.""

 

        ""I sunburned Draco."" She smiles innocently. 

 

        ""Ow, that oughta hurt."" 

 

        ""I'll teleport him some aloe lotion."" She shrugs. ""I'm not that mean."" Draco runs off the train, spouting curses in rhymes. ""Or maybe I am."" The first years, Jennifer, and I file into the great hall. Dumbledore introduces us as the exchange students and explains that we will be sorted with the first years.

 

        After they get sorted, Professor McGonagall calls, ""Thompson, Emilia!""

 

        I pad up to the rickety stool and sit down, yanking the Sorting Hat over my eyes.

 

        Well, well, well, the hat says, what have we here? A daughter of Nyx? Let's see...no romantic feelings? Ever? Boring.

 

        Hey! I give an indignant sniff. Not like you could fall in love--you're a hat!

 

        Touche. But still, you're going to be incredibly dull to sort. Ooh, you fought in the last Great War? Ooh, with a meat cleaver. And a gun. Both Stygian iron. I take back what I said earlier--you're going to be very interesting. You plan to cut old Voldy's head open. Very nice. Fourth wall breaker...that qualifies you for Ravenclaw, but then you did kill about fifteen giants with your handgun while falling into Tartarus, so better be...

 

        ""GRYFFINDOR!""

 

        I smirk and pull the hat off, sauntering over to the table that I've been placed at. As soon as I've sat down, I send a star projectile over to the Slytherin table to poke Malfoy in the bum. He yelps and shoots out of his seat. The rest of the great hall is filled with laughter.

 

        ""Vanderkindren, Jennifer!""

 

        Jennifer struts up to the stool and pulls the hat down onto her head. She seems to be having a mental argument with it and winning.

 

        Never mind, she's losing.

 

        After a little over five minutes, the hat finally comes to a decision.

 

        ""GRYFFINDOR EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS A CRAP TON OF HUFFLEPUFF IN HER!""

 

        Jennifer frowns, confused, but she walks over to the Gryffindor table. She sits next to me and sighs. ""Gryffindor? Why Gryffindor? I wanted to be a Hufflepuff. Now I have to deal with these butt-headed, reckless idiots. I would have even settled for Ravenclaw.""

 

        ""At least we're in Harry's house. We can take care of him more easily."" 

 

        ""Yeah, but Hufflepuff is next to the kitchens."" She mutters sadly. ""And it's homey. And all the Hufflepuffs are nice and like food like me."" She slumps in her chair and stares longingly at the food trays. A Hufflepuff pipes up from behind us. 

 

        ""Don't worry, I know how you feel."" She smiles, her grey eyes sparkling. Her hair is a pretty strawberry blonde, just like Josephine's back at camp, except this girl has a streak of black that she dyed in it. ""Nice to see you again, Jennifer."" 

 

        ""Abbey!"" Jennifer's eyes light up. ""You never told me you were in Hufflepuff! Lucky."" 

 

        ""You must be Emi!"" Abbey shakes my hand. ""I'll introduce you two to my best friend in potions."" She smiles even wider than Jennifer does. ""You'll probably want to be a little cautious around him, being Gryffindors and all."" 

 

        ""Why's that?"" I ask. 

 

        ""He's--he's a Slytherin."" She says nervously.

 

        ""Oh, the whole Slytherin and Gryffindor rivalry."" Jennifer nods. ""I get it.""

 

        I roll my eyes. ""Why is there a rivalry, anyway? If Gryffindors and Slytherins joined forces, we could conquer the world!"" I flip open my meat cleaver and start filing my nails with it.

 

        ""Try not to conquer the world, Ems.""

 

        Abbey jumps. ""Where did you get that and why do you have it?""

 

        ""Oh, this old thing?"" I hold up the weapon. ""Our camp teaches self-defense! I tend toward more...gruesome techniques. I have a gun too! Do you want to see it?""

 

        Jennifer swats at my meat cleaver. ""Put it away and shut up about camp. We're supposed to be inconspicuous, remember?""

 

        I blink. ""Oh, right."" I twirl my cleaver, turning it back into a keychain. 

 

        ""I think we scared her."" 

 

        ""Dang straight!"" (lol no im gay af -Niko) Abbey jumps in. ""What's going on?""

 

        Jennifer bites her lip nervously and sighs. ""Meet us in the second-floor girl's bathroom tonight.""

 

        ""What if Filch catches us?"" 

 

        ""Trust me."" Jennifer smiles slyly. ""We can do this. Just wait for me in the Hufflepuff common room at midnight. Password's knocking on the barrel two from the bottom, in the middle of the second row, to the rhythm of 'Helga Hufflepuff,' right?""

 

        Abbey's eyes narrow. ""How did you know that?""

 

        I smirk. ""We have our ways.""

 

        We looked it up online. Way easier than, say, asking someone, right?

 

        Right.

 

        Note the sarcasm.

 

         ""Mimbulus Mimbletonia,"" I pant. I just backflipped off of a freaking moving staircase so that I could get to the Fat Lady's portrait. 

 

        ""Ow,"" Jennifer hisses, rubbing her ankle. ""Wish I'd done parkour or something at camp."" 

 

        ""You okay?"" My brows furrow in concern.

 

        ""Yeah, just twisted it. I can fix it."" Singing a few lines of a hymn to her father, she heals her ankle in a pinch. We step into our common room, Jennifer rubbing her wand nervously. She looks around, gets a little startled when Crookshanks jumps out of the shadows, and goes completely invisible. ""Frick,"" she mutters, realizing she went invisible again. She drops the invisibility and quietly starts muttering greek curses. ""Stupid cat."" She whips out her wand and stares at Crookshanks, probably contemplating setting him on fire.

 

        I look around the common room as the painting closes behind us. Nobody stirs. ""Hey, J?""

 

        Jennifer turns around. ""What? I'm trying to hex a cat here!""

 

        ""What should we do while we wait?"" I ask.

 

        ""Go to the Room of Requirement and practice being normal?"" She deadpans.

 

        I laugh. ""Sure, let's go. I can shadow travel us there, if you want. Just keep your eyes open this time.""

 

        She nods. ""Okay, let's do this!""

 

        I grab her hand, pull her into the shadows, and picture the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. There's a stretching sensation, and then we tumble out of the shadows of the corridor.

 

        Jennifer shivers. ""I will never get used to shadow travel.""

 

        ""You okay?""

 

        ""Yeah, I just hate it. It's so dark, even with the stars..."" Jennifer glances around the room. ""Nice place, though.""

 

        ""Yeah. Lots of...are those mirrors?"" I shudder. Mirrors always break when I'm around. It gives me the creeps.

 

        Jennifer's brow furrows. ""The hellhound incident?""

 

        ""The hellhound incident."" I agree. ""Well, we should probably start practicing."" I draw my wand.

 

        She nods and pulls out her own. ""Expelliarmus!""  With a flick of her wrist, my wand flies into her free hand. She smiles. ""I did it!""

 

        ""Yeah, you did. Can I have my wand back now?"" I hold out my hand and she passes my wand back. I focus on the day Jennifer and I met Dante. Full of smiles and laughter, that was one of the best days of my life. ""EXPECTO PATRONUM!""

 

        A skeletal winged horse--a Thestral--bursts out of the end of my wand, galloping around the room. I suck in a breath. Something I read in a book on defensive magic comes back to me.

 

        ""One of the rarest is the Thestral Patronus. It signifies a selfless and unique soul, one that is often misunderstood and seen as antisocial and strange."" I recite.

 

        Jennifer whistles. ""Sweet."" She scrunches her eyebrows together in concentration. ""EXPECTO PATRONUM!"" 

 

        A feathered, dragon-like creature emerges from the tip of her wand, changing size as fluidly as Frank Zhang changes shape.

 

      I suck in a breath. ""That's an Occamy.""

 

        ""A what?""

 

        ""An Occamy. It's one of the only tangible Patronuses. You'll be able to hug this thing!"" I laugh. ""Just imagine the possibilities!""

 

        She looks at me strangely. ""I have no idea why we're friends.""

 

        ""Probably because I keep you from dying daily,"" I smirk. ""Being a Primordial's kid has its perks.""

 

        Jennifer rolls her eyes and aims her wand at a statue that I swear wasn't there before. ""Confringo.""  The statue explodes into shrapnel.

 

        ""Dang, J, that one could kill in a battle. Literally and figuratively."" I snicker at my joke.

 

        ""Very funny."" Jennifer deadpans. ""Go ahead, try it.""

 

        I sigh. ""Confringo.""  The wall explodes. ""Oops, my hand slipped,"" I say flatly.

 

        She huffs and flicks her wand at a vase, which, ironically, has Greek designs all over it. ""Bombarda.""  It immediately turns to shrapnel.

 

        I smirk. ""Oh, it is on."" I point my wand at a large stack of papers. ""INCENDIO!""

 

        The stack bursts into flame.

 

        Jennifer grins. ""Glacius!""  The paper is encapsulated in an ice cube so quickly that the fire doesn't even have time to extinguish. Instead, it crystallizes.

 

        I open a portal, pull out a blowtorch, and melt the ice. What was once a raging fire is now a golden crystal, warm to the touch and as clear as glass. I use a shrinking charm on the flame and pocket it for future use.

 

        Jennifer raises her wand once more. ""Tempus."" A flashing 11:45 appears in the air. She sucks in a breath. ""We need to get going.""

 

        ""Why?"" I ask. Then I realize that tempus means time. ""Crap, you're right!""

 

        She laughs. ""You are way too forgetful for your own good, Emi.""

 

        I drag her into the shadows again. This time, we reappear next to a stack of barrels.

 

        ""What are we doing again?"" Abbey asks as we pad through the corridors.

 

        I smirk. ""Visiting an old friend.""

 

        Jennifer nods. ""A very old friend.""

 

        I giggle. ""Ancient. Ghostlike, even.""

 

        ""It's a ghost,"" Jennifer explains bluntly.

 

        ""She's a ghost,"" I correct her. ""Respect the pronouns, hon.""

 

        Jennifer sighs. ""Anyway, Myrtle is an old friend of ours. Or at least a friend of Emi's. Long story. She can help us out because there's a couple of things we needed to ask her. You're here because we might need your help.""

 

        ""You called?"" Myrtle's ghoulish wail of a voice echoes from somewhere in the bathroom.  

 

        ""Hey, Myrtle,"" I greet her.

 

        ""Oh, hello, Emi. I see you've gotten back from Tartarus?"" 

 

        ""We need your help,"" Jennifer pipes up. ""We have to become Animagi."" 

 

        ""Animagi?"" Abbey squeaks. 

 

        ""We'll explain in a minute."" Jennifer smiles weakly.

 

        ""There's a book in the restricted section about it. Filch won't be there from 1:00-3:00 AM on Saturday."" Myrtle offers.

 

        ""Thanks, Myrtle,"" I thank her. ""Say hey to Nico for me, will you? He's in the Slytherin dorms.""

 

        ""It's no problem,"" Myrtle replies with a short nod and vanishes.

 

        ""Wait, why do you two want to become animagi?"" Abbey asks curiously. 

 

        ""We've been assigned the task by my half-sister, who happens to be a goddess, to protect Harry Potter and make sure he doesn't die,"" I deadpan, waiting for the Hufflepuff girl to laugh in disbelief.

 

        ""Half-sister? Goddess? What the heck?"" Abbey runs her fingers through her hair nervously. ""What are you guys talking about?""

 

        ""Can we tell her about the whole half-blood thing?"" Jennifer asks me. ""Or can we not?""

 

        ""Sure."" I nod. ""Abbey seems trustworthy."" I turn to the girl in question. ""You won't tell, will you?""

 

        ""No. But tell what?"" She cocks her head.

 

        I take a deep breath. ""Let me reintroduce myself. I am Emilia Ilena Thompson, Daughter of Nyx, goddess of Night, and Sloane; Heir to the Throne of Night; sister to Nash Idell, demigod; Hecate, goddess of magic; Thanatos, god of death; Hypnos, god of sleep; Eris, goddess of strife; Geras, daemon of old age; Moros, god of doom; Nemesis, goddess of revenge; the Moirai, the Keres, and the Oneiroi; Survivor of Tartarus; Princess of the Murk; Bane of Tereus and Prokne; Controller of the Shadows; Adoptive Mother of Allen Ashton; Senior Counselor of the Nyx Cabin; Recoverer of the Kantharoi of Jason and Theseus; Recipient of the Blessing of Hecate; Bearer of the Crown of Night; Wielder of Skull Splitter. Sorry for the long title. Demigod heroes always have them.""

 

        Jennifer jumps in with her title. ""Jennifer Caitlinn Vanderkindren, Daughter of Apollo, god of the Sun, and Melanie; Lieutenant Healer in the Infirmary at Camp Half-Blood; Lieutenant Counselor of the Apollo Cabin; Bane of Philomela and Erisikhthon; Sworn Sister to Emilia Ilena Thompson; Recoverer of Sappho's Poems; Bender of the Sun; Bearer of the Crown of Day. I can't remember the rest. How do you do it, Emi?""

 

        ""I got a tattoo of it on my stomach about three months ago. Now, every time I look at myself, I see those words. I've memorized it."" I laugh at her perplexed frown. ""Sorry I didn't tell you.""

 

        Abbey waves at us. ""I'm here too, you know. What is this, some kind of sick prank?""

 

        I snort and summon a pair of shadow wings. ""Does it look like a prank to you? Note how these shadows are supporting my weight. Would normal shadows be able to do that?""

 

        Abbey narrows her eyes. ""How did you do that?""

 

        ""I just told you, numskull,"" I grumble. ""Wow, you are thick."" [T h i c c--]

 

        Jennifer swats me with her bow, which she must have summoned while I wasn't looking. ""Don't insult her.""

 

        ""Oh, come on, it was a joke! Can't you take a joke?"" I whine. ""And besides, I'm tired. Being tired makes me grumpy. The entire reason I've made it through this without collapsing is that I've been feeding off of the shadows. You know how dangerous that can be.""

 

        She rolls her eyes and turns to Abbey with a sigh. ""In short, we're demigods. My dad is Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and music, and a few other things. Emi's mom is Nyx, also Greek, except Nyx is a primordial goddess of the night and 200 times more powerful. That also makes Emi about as powerful as, well, an Olympian,"" Jennifer states. ""You following this?"" Abbey nods shortly. ""We come from a place called Camp Half-Blood, which happens to be the only safe place on Earth for demigods, especially really powerful ones like Emi."" 

 

       I chime in. ""Besides Camp Jupiter. And Hecate, who created the race of wizards and happens to be my half-sister, asked us to protect Harry Potter because he's probably going to die at some point--""

 

       ""Oh, and we're kind of a year late because Harry kind of almost died last year--""

 

       ""And we've got to make sure nobody knows that we're demigods because then we would be wildly endangered and probably killed in some really gory, nasty way."" 

 

       ""And Harry Potter's entire story was pretty much predicted in a book series that has millions of fans and that's why we know so much about this world."" 

 

       ""Also, the DADA teacher is a terrible person and won't actually teach defense against the dark arts. She's going to inflict really harsh punishments and rules. She's Satan in a pink cardigan."" 

 

       ""Everyone who read the book series hates her.""

 

       ""Oh, also, Harry's gonna set up this group that teaches DADA so that nobody dies in the inevitable battle against Voldy in a few years.""

 

       ""And Voldemort is back.""

 

       Abbey freezes. ""What?""

 

        ""Yeah, that happened,"" I shrug. ""Now let's get to bed. I can shadow travel you back into your common room.""

 

        ""Shadow what?""

 

        ""It's a thing."" I take her hand and yank her through the shadows into the Hufflepuff common room. Jennifer appears next to me through a lamp.

 

        Abbey blinks in horror after emerging from the shadows. ""That was the most traumatic thing I've ever experienced.""

 

        ""You get used to it,"" I wink.

 

        Jennifer sighs. ""Come on, Ems. We gotta get back to the Gryffindor common room."" She takes my hand and pulls me through the light. Moments later, we arrive in our room. ""That, my friend, is why I like traveling through light so much."" She turns and starts rummaging through her suitcase. 

 

        ""What are you looking for?""

 

        ""Paper. I'm sending a letter to Dante."" 

 

        ""At this hour?"" Jennifer nods in response. 

 

        ""Ooh, there's some,"" She pulls a sheet of paper and a pencil out of her bag and scribbles down a message. The brunette whistles and her owl Ragdoll swoops in through the window. The brown owl swivels his head and takes the letter. ""You know who to take it to,"" She says quietly, and Ragdoll flies out into the night. 

 

        ""What did you write?"" 

 

        ""Told him about what's happening. Said we miss him. Stuff like that."" 

 

        ""You okay?""

 

        ""Yeah, I'm fine,"" she nods. With a few waves of her wand, she's wearing a pair of owl pajamas, and the light is turned off. ""Night,"" She says shortly before retreating under her blankets and falling asleep.

 

        I mumble sleepily in return before climbing into bed, still fully clothed, and drifting off to dreamland.

hehe burnt hair mark go brrr


        ""Emi? What are you doing at the Slytherin table?"" Nico looks at me like I'm insane. 



        ""Shut it, we need to talk,"" I respond, stealing a croissant from a nearby basket and stuffing it in my mouth. 



        ""You could have sent an owl, you know."" 



        ""I'm running on six hours of sleep and a cup of coffee. Don't test me, di Angelo."" 



        ""Whatever. What do you need?""



        A nearby Slytherin flips me off and says a few swear words before I give them double birds, hex them, and continue to talk to Nico. ""We need to find a specific book in the restricted section, but we only know that it has the spell to become an animagus in it. Do you know what book would have it?"" 



        ""Do you think that just because I'm a Slytherin, I would know the details of restricted section books?"" 



        ""Well no...""



        ""Because I do,"" he replies bluntly. ""'The Magic of Creatures.' Skimmed it once or twice last year.""



        ""Have you used anything in it before?""



        ""No, I only skimmed it.""



        ""Alright, just needed to know."" 



        ""Beat it, extra!"" Snaps a nearby Slytherin. ""You think you're so high and mighty that you can sit at anyone's table?"" His ash-blond hair is spiked up, but the gel or spell or whatever he used is wearing off. 



        I smirk and send Jennifer a message. Wow, a real-life Katsuki Bakugo. I then steel myself and send the kid a death glare. ""Oh, honey. You know, it's funny how you think you can intimidate me. I've seen far worse.""



        Oh shoot, Jennifer sends back. Don't kill him yet, I want to see how someone can be that much of a butt.  



        The kid scoffs. ""You think you've seen worse than me? ""



        ""How does growing up in a place meant to torture monsters sound?"" I smirk. ""Think you could survive that?"" 



        ""Cool it, Jasper,"" A black-haired boy cuffs the kid upside the head. ""You've already lost us twenty points. Don't ruin our chances at the house cup."" He turns and stares flatly at me and Nico, sharp grey eyes narrowed in vague suspicion. ""You really should leave,"" he finishes. I shrug and head back to the Gryffindor table.



        Jennifer smiles. ""Did you get to find out where the book is?""



        ""Yeah, and the IRL Katsuki was stopped by some guy."" I shrug. ""Fairly handsome, with black hair. Hey, don't look at me like that! I can tell whether someone is attractive without being attracted to them."" 



        Jennifer chuckles. ""Oh well. At least he stopped him. You probably would have cruciatused his butt out the window."" 



        ""Probably.""



        ""Eat up! Snape's not gonna be happy if we're running low on energy."" She punctuates her sentence by stuffing a muffin in her mouth.



        ""Oh, hi!"" A nearby boy waves at us.



        Jennifer takes the muffin out of her mouth and hisses, spraying crumbs at him by accident. I silently draw my meat cleaver, but Jennifer pushes my hand down. 



        ""No murder today, Ems,"" She reprimands me under her breath. 



        ""You never let me have any fun,"" I pout and, with a flick of my wrist, my weapon turns back into a charm.



        ""Hush."" Jennifer turns to the boy. "" I'm Jennifer, this is Emi. I apologize for the crumbs. And you are?""



        ""Colin,"" he smiles. ""It's rare Hogwarts ever gets a new kid, let alone two.""



        ""Well, nice to meet you,"" Jennifer states quickly. She stares at her croissant, thinking of something to say and probably resisting the urge to talk about anime. ""Uh, you want some food?""



        ""I'll be eating with my friends, but thanks anyway."" He slips away quietly.



        The brunette smiles and takes a quick bite of food, watching Colin join a pretty blonde at the end of the table. ""Huh. Isn't that the annoying kid that Harry met in his second year?""



        ""Yeah, I think so."" I munch on my food thoughtfully. After breakfast, we head to our first class.



        Jennifer brushes the crumbs off her uniform. ""Off to class, I suppose.""



        I nod and we jog all the way to Potions. We enter the classroom, and Jennifer's happy disposition melts at the sight of Snape. ""And captain sarcasm is still here."" I give her a sympathetic glance. Snape was never her favorite character when reading the books. She spots Abbey. ""Hey, Abbey!"" She ran over to her strawberry-blonde friend and hugged her for a few seconds. When she let her go, she smiled. ""So, where's your friend?"" The Slytherin boy who stopped the wannabe Bakugo almost appears behind her, his large hand on her shoulder.



        ""And you are?"" He asks, spooking Jennifer. She turns around, her theatrical performer's confidence gone.



        ""Jennifer,"" She says quietly. ""One of the transfers.""



        ""Well, I am Daniel."" He says flatly, shaking her hand. He looks at her tie, which takes a little effort since he's standing at at least six feet tall. ""Gryffindor."" He says through his teeth. ""Right. Good thing you're probably not like Mark and his gang."" He drops her hand and steps back. I walk over, ready to defend her, but Abbey beats me to the punch.



        ""Try not to scare her, Daniel. She only just got here. She's my friend.""



        Daniel stares suspiciously at Jennifer for a moment. ""Well then I suppose I'll try to get along with you."" I finish walking over.



        I hold my hand out. ""Emi. The other transfer."" He looks at my tie, then at my hand, and wordlessly shakes my hand, likely fairly reluctantly, and walks away.



        ""Don't worry, he'll warm up to you eventually,"" Abbey assures us. ""He's just kinda nervous about Gryffindors because of Mark and his gang.""



        ""Who's Mark?""



        ""This one Gryffindor guy in our year. He's a big bully and kind of notorious for bullying Hufflepuffs. His gang just follows him around 'cause they think his dumb 'jokes' are funny.""



        ""And that was your friend?"" Jennifer asks.



        ""Yeah, he's just a little leery about new people. He's real nice once you get to know him."" We sit at three desks in a row with Jennifer in the middle.



        ""I am death!"" A Gryffindor screeches from the corner, dumping something into a cauldron. Snape hits him with his wand.



        ""So, is Mark in this period?"" Jennifer turns to Abbey.



        ""Unfortunately,"" Abbey mumbles. A tall, blond boy appears behind her. 



        ""My ears are burning, I hope you guys aren't talking about me."" Abbey shoots Jennifer an oh no look. He walks around the desks and leans on mine. ""Looks like we got a couple cuties in the Gryffindor house this year."" He looks at Jennifer. ""Including this little snack of a girl.""



        ""Call me a snack again and I'll set you on fire.""



        ""Ooh, feisty. You're cute when you're angry.""



        She jumps to her feet. ""I'm about to get real frickin' adorable!""



        I start to pull out my gun, but Jennifer slaps it away. Instead, I pull out my meat cleaver and point it at his nose. He freaks out and falls back. I vault over the desk and put the blade next to his neck. I glare at him. ""Listen, sweetheart. You may think you're the gods' gift to mankind, but news flash, you aren't. If you so much as touch my friends, I'll throw you into Tartarus.""



        ""And what makes you think you can?"" He says, his flirty smile on his face. He leaned forward, letting the blade touch his neck. ""Go ahead. I dare you. Use your pretty blade. Who says I'm not a masochist?"" My grip on the handle tightens. I use my powers to let him see my memories of Tartarus. He lets out a scream, jumps backward, and falls over the desk.



        ""That."" I flip my knife and it turns back into a charm. I pocket it and return to my seat. 



        ""You were awesome, Emi!"" Jennifer exclaims.



        ""All in a day's work."" Mark staggers to a seat next to his friends, his brown eyes wide and his hair messy.



        ""It's a pity he's so mean,"" Abbey murmurs. ""I respect a lot of Gryffindors. I'd befriend him if he weren't a bully.""



        ""He's kinda hot too,"" Jennifer adds. I send her a look of confusion. ""What? He's just pretty! Besides, you know I have a thing for blondes.""



        ""Okay then,"" I smile. Snape starts to teach. The lesson is as sarcastic as he is, however, Jennifer fidgets with the light, using her photokinesis to pass the time. When she isn't directing sunbeams in the eyes of rude people, she's making sure that Harry is safe.



        The rest of the period and everything up until lunch was fairly boring. Abbey, Jennifer, and I chat as we walk into the great hall for the second time today. Mark and his gang cut us off. ""Hello again, girls."" He smiles a Hazbin Hotel-esque smile, his hands tucked behind his back and his posture straight and casual. He stands taller than Daniel, probably around six foot five.



        ""Hey, Mark,"" Abbey mutters.



        ""Not you."" Another boy steps from behind Mark, a similar (but less charming) smile on his lips. ""Idiot Hufflepuffs don't get to talk to him.""



        ""You talked to me! What's going on in your head, Austin?""



        ""Let the pretty lady alone, we have plenty of other time to joke,"" Mark waves his hand dismissively. ""Besides, you've used that joke before."" I notice that the tips of his hair are dyed red. Jennifer pipes up.



        ""You look like Alastor from Hazbin Hotel.""



        ""Who?""



        ""My gosh, you're a pureblood,"" Jennifer realizes. She pulled out her phone and pulled up a picture of Alastor. ""Like this guy.""



        ""I look nothing like him.""



        ""Whaddya mean? You're tall, lanky, have too much leg, and you look like you've killed a man."" Mark's smile wavers.



        ""Ah. It appears the pretty lady has a brain as sharp as her tongue.""



        ""Quit your flattery, uh,"" I turn to Abbey. ""What's his last name?""



        ""Sheere.""



        ""Sheere!""



        ""Whatever you say, M'lady."" He took a deep bow and wandered off, group of bullies in tow. Jennifer snorts.



        ""Is he a jerk? Is he a flirt? Pick a personality, buddy.""



        ""He does this all the time,"" Abbey sighs. ""He acts all flirty for a week or so and then becomes the biggest bully known to man."" Jennifer wrinkles her nose and walks into the great hall, vanishing from sight. Literally. Like before our eyes she goes invisible. Abbey squints in confusion. ""The heck?""



        ""Photokinesis,"" I sigh.  ""Apollo kid thing.""



        ""Let's go eat, then.""



        Jennifer turns out to be quietly burning off some of Mark's hair by focusing sunlight. She returns next to me, appearing in a puff of dust. She sighs, clearly tired and hungry, expressing that by chowing down on her lunch.

She turned her head towards Draco and gave him a thumbs up to indicate that she'll be there. Draco smiled back at her. 

 

After the charms Hermione and Ron met Draco by the lake. Ron was totally confused as to why Draco asked him to accompany Hermione .

"" I'm sorry to have called you by passing note in the class but this is actually important. I'll finish talking before you guys start. I'm in love with Harry. ""

This earned a gasp from Ron but he continued anyway .

"" I'll tell him my feelings tonight because tomorrow is his birthday. I want to give him his present by midnight and also want to talk about this to him. I know you guys are so important to him. So here I am standing before you asking permission to date Harry. If you don't trust me I can understand that""  

Hermione gave him a knowing smile and hugged him.  "" Of course you idiot. We trust you. You can date him. You can also steal him tonight. But take care of him "" 

 

Ron is not an asshole. He accepted Draco whole heartedly but he also gave him a warning about getting his arse kicked if he hurt Harry at any cost. 

Draco thanked them went to the owlery to send Harry a letter 

  Dear Harry,


            Meet me by the lake by 10 Tonight. Wear something cute.



                                            - Draco malfoy


-time skip to 10 that night- 

  Draco was 15 minutes early. He was wearing a white button up shirt with black leather pants and a jacket with a matching pair of shoes. He got up from the rock which he transfigured into a cushion to sit on. Harry was walking towards him in a green button up shirt which definitely brought his eyes out. Draco can practically hear his heart skip a beat. Draco handed Harry a bouquet of tulips which he accepted gracefully. 

 

""So, what's the occasion? "" Harry asked Draco

""Oh wow. Did you really forget your birthday?? I wanted to surprise you for your birthday. I wanted to be the first one to wish you tonight. So I'm stealing you away from the crowd. You are mine tonight. "" Draco blushed at his own words. Harry have him a smile which was only meant for Draco. 

 

Draco took him inside the forbidden forest. 

"" Are you going to murder me? Is that the surprise?"" Harry asked him teasingly

""Pardon me you hurt my feeling"" Draco replied sarcastically. 

They were quiet for the rest of the walk. Draco took Harry to a place which Harry can swear that he has never seen before. Draco let go of Harry's hands. Harry's jaw dropped at the sight. There was a little picnic setting at that place. It's the top of the waterfall. The full moon was hanging off of the edge , the stars were sprinkled all over the sky and this is the most beautiful place that can exist.

 

Harry turned to Draco to give him a bone crushing hug. "" Thank you so much Draco"" 

""Anything for you"" 

They enjoyed the night in silence. It was almost midnight. Harry began 

"" I want to tell you something"" 

""Sure. Go ahead'

""Promise me you won't hate me or push me off this cliff after I finish"" 

Okay this made Draco's heart race. ""Of course"" 

"" This is the best birthday gift ever .I thank you for that. This setting is so beautiful. This looks like a date. So I've decided to do this . "" He took a deep breath and looked straight into Draco's grey eyes and continued "" I love you Draco"" 

Draco can swear that all the air in his lungs are knocked out. 

""Wow. I did not see this coming"" 

""It's okay if you don't re-""

Harry was cut off by Draco's lips. Draco pushed him on the blanket and got on top of Harry and kissed him like there was no tomorrow. Harry returned the kiss. He poured everything he had into the kiss. The kiss was everything they wanted but never had. They broke the kiss just to get some oxygen.

""I love you too . I was supposed to tell you this first. You stole it from me. ""Draco fake pouted 

Harry just smiled and pulled Draco in for another kiss. They spent the whole night cuddling under the stars. Harry couldn't have asked for a better birthday.

Harry used to hate mornings.  Always dragging arse out of bed to start doing his chores or start classes at school.  Worrying about if and when Voldemort would kill him.  Hiding the fear that would sometimes try to eat him alive.  And always trying to not think about his future.

He used to think he wouldn't have one.  A future, that is.  Especially when he reached his 18th birthday.  That was the day he killed Voldemort, nearly losing his own life in the process because of the amount of magic he had used.

Coming awake in the sterile whiteness of a private room at St. Mungo's, missing out on a year of your life certainly makes one re-evaluate life.

The most significant change?  Putting aside nearly 7 years of hatred and animosity and becoming friends with Draco Malfoy.  Another year of innocent dinner meetings, and movies and just being around each other brought him to where he was now: happy, content, and in the 8th year of a long-term relationship with the former Slytherin and Death Eater spy.

And we've had our ups and downs like any other couple have.  He mused.

But they were still together.  And he didn't want that to go away.

- - -

And here he sat, nearly 5 in the morning, sitting on the bottom step of the house he and Draco had purchased three years into their relationship, watching the sun rise.  Harry no longer took things for granted like he did in school.  He realized life was too short for that and he appreciated his life a lot more.

He watched the pale blue sky lighten, unaware that Draco was standing in the doorway behind him, silently watching.

Draco had a warm smile on his face as he stared down at his best friend and husband.


To think I almost lost him, all those years ago.


It was true.  Draco didn't know when he'd fallen for Harry, but he realized the extent of his feelings for the Gryffindor when Harry had been in a coma for over a year after defeating Voldemort.  He fought it of course, he had worked so hard to become Harry's friend just before they left school and he didn't want to mess that up.

- - -

When Harry had been in his coma, Draco realized he no longer felt a friendship with Harry.  He loved him.  The shock of it nearly did him in.  Hermione and Ron quickly snapped him out of it and promised to help him when Harry came back to himself.

And they did.  It started simple enough, dinners at Ron and Hermione's home, movie dates with all four of them, always making sure to include Draco in all their outings.

It was on one such outing when Ron and Hermione made some lame excuse and left Harry and Draco alone.  Draco was nervous, Harry had been watching him most of the evening.  He kept twisting his fingers in his hair and looking at everything but Harry.

But Harry had surprised him.

""Draco, stop fidgeting and bloody kiss me already!""

Draco had been so stunned, his mouth hung open.  Harry simply shrugged in his calm way and covered Draco's open mouth with his own.

And they'd been together ever since.

- - -

Harry smiled as he watched a couple of seagulls dive down into the water for their breakfast.  His stomach rumbled, reminding him of his own needs and he got to his feet.  He finished his coffee, poured the dregs onto the grass, and as he turned to go inside, the first rays of the sun flashed over the water and bounced off the white-washed house.

He couldn't believe he was living here.  He'd nearly given up on life, all those years ago.  And now he had a husband and a house of his own.  And recently, he and Draco had been in talks about starting a family, thanks to a new fertility potion created by Severus Snape.

He saw Draco in the door and his smile widened.  Draco opened the door as Harry came up the stairs.  Harry pulled him into his arms and kissed him thoroughly.  He tasted like cinnamon, remnants of the coffee he had consumed.

Harry pulled away and smiled at the dazed look on his husband's face.

""And good morning to you, too.""  Draco smiled.  ""You're in a good mood.""

""Why shouldn't I be?""  Harry asked, digging into the fridge for eggs, onions, green and red peppers, sausage and bread to start breakfast.  He also pulled out some tortilla shells.

""No reason.""  Draco smiled, moving to help chop the vegetables.  ""Breakfast burritos?""

""Yep.""

""My favorite.""  And they had been ever since Harry had made them for breakfast their first morning as a wedded couple.

""I don't know where you put it all.  You're so bloody slim.""  Harry grumbled, but in a good way.

""And you're so bloody muscular.""  Draco teased, watching Harry blush.

""Prat.""

""But you love me, despite it.""

""That I do.""  Harry grinned.

""Do you have any plans for today?  It's not every day you turn 26.""

""There used to be a time when I didn't think I'd live to see 20.""  Harry sighed.  Draco smacked his arm lightly.

""No maudlin thoughts today, Potter!""

""That's Malfoy-Potter, thank you.""  Harry laughed.  ""And to answer your question, Hermione and Ron want me to go to Hogwarts today for lunch and eat with the staff.  Want to come with?""

""I'd love to, you know I would, but I have appointments at The Ministry today.  But, we can stay there for dinner if you'd like, maybe take a run around the pitch for old times sake.""

Harry's eyes lit up at the thought of flying.

""I thought you'd like that idea.""

""Have I told you yet how much I love you Mister Potter-Malfoy?""

""No, but I never get tired of hearing it.""  Draco smiled.  Harry kissed his cheek and they returned to making breakfast.

- - -

""Are you sure you want to do this Draco?  This is an awful lot of money for a present.""  Ginny asked.

""I do, Ginny.""  Draco nodded.

""You do realize that by signing this, if anything were to happen, you'd be fined and possibly sentenced to a year in Azkaban.""

""Yes.""

""Why, Draco?  Tell me that much at least?""  the woman pleaded.

""Because he's worth it, Ginny.""  Draco stated.  She thought about that for a moment.

""He is worth it.""  she agreed.  She handed over a quill and Draco signed the document on the desk.  Once his signature dried, the scroll vanished, heading to the appropriate department within the Ministry.  ""Where shall I send it?""

""Harry and I will be having dinner at Hogwarts.  Send it around 6 or so.""

""I hope you know what you're doing, Draco Potter-Malfoy.""  she sighed.

""So do I, Gin.  So do I.""  Draco smiled before leaving.

- - -

Draco was the last one to arrive at dinner that evening.  He greeted his former professors with a smile, sitting down between Severus and Harry.  He kissed Harry lightly on the lips.  McGonagall signaled to the house elves to serve dinner.

""How have you been, Draco.  I haven't seen much of you as of late.""  Severus asked, cutting into his steak.

""I'm well, Severus.  Busy with The Weasley Twins expanding the shop.""

""I hear that they are expanding their operation into the United States and Canada.""  Poppy asked from across the table.  Harry looked at her.

""They are.  They've gotten the full backing of the Canadian and American Ministries.  They're hoping to bring in more tourists to the area.""

""What's this I hear about them changing the name?""  Remus asked.

""That's still up in the air at the moment.  But they are considering it.""  Draco answered.

""Harry.  I have a proposition for you.""  McGonagall began.  He looked at her expectantly.

""One of our teachers is retiring and I am in need of someone of your skills.""

""All do respect, Min, I don't think I could contribute anything worthy.""

""Let me finish, Mr Potter.""  she declared.

""Yes, Ma'am.""  he smiled, not even bothering to correct her.

""As I was saying.  We asked her who her ideal replacement would be and she stated your name without hesitation.""

""Her?""  Draco frowned, looking at Poppy.

""Not me!  Goodness no!""  Poppy exclaimed with a laugh.

""I don't understand.""  Harry frowned.  Hermione looked at him.

""Harry, what the Headmistress is trying to ask...would you consider signing on as the new flying instructor and Quidditch instructor?""

""Yeah, mate!""  Ron smiled.  ""You were born for this job.""

Harry was stunned.  He looked at Madame Hooch.

""It's true, Harry.  These old bones of mine no longer have the drive or desire to stay in the air.  I would gladly give up my position if you'll say you'll take it.""

Harry looked at Draco.

""Draco?""

""Harry, I have no problem with it.  We would still have our home during the summer and when we want to get away from the students.  Where you go, I go.""  Draco smiled.

Harry stared into Draco's eyes, seeing the truth of what he was saying.  He looked around the table, seeing all the smiles, save for one.

""Professor Snape?  I know we don't always get along-""

""Po-...Harry, it's true we didn't have the type of teacher-student relationship we should have, but I am not completely heartless to deny this of you.""  Severus stated.  ""And if we are to be colleagues, maybe you should call me Severus.""

And he stunned everyone in the room by giving Harry a rare but genuine smile.

""Thank you...Severus.""

""And Harry?""

""Sir?""  Old habits die hard, after all.

""Happy Birthday.""

""Thank you, Sir.""  Harry grinned.

At that moment, a majestic eagle owl swirled into the Hall and settled in front a Harry, a package clutched gently in his beak.

Draco resisted the urge to grin as Harry took the package and attached letter.

Harry opened the letter and read out loud for everyone's benefit.

Harry was speechless.  Hands trembling, he took the box (noticing finally the breathing holes in the sides) and slowly opened it.  The feathers caught his eye first.  A deep golden color that seem to reflect the light from everywhere in the room.  The little creature slowly opened his red eyes and blinked sleepily.  Spotting Harry, its wings began to blur and he hovered out of the box and near his face.  Harry felt the slight brush of his tongue against his cheek and he giggled.  He held out his hand and the Snidget alighted on his fingers, chirping contentedly.

""He's beautiful.""  Harry whispered to no one in particular.

""Harry, there's a note in the box.""  Draco told him.  Snidge (as he decided to name his new friend), moved to sit on Harry's shoulder as Harry plucked up the second note.


Happy Birthday to my one and only.



This is probably not what you were expecting for a birthday gift.  But I needed to show you how much you mean to me and no ordinary gift would ever do.



You are the very air that I breathe, the light to my dark, the sun to my moon.  You've made me feel things that I thought for sure I'd never feel with anybody.  I'd given up on ever finding someone to see through my tough exterior to the man I am inside, but you did, and I am forever humbled that you have graced me with your love.



Please accept this gift as my total devotion to you.



You may not think you are worth of such a thing.



But you are worth it.



Love, now and forever,



Your husband.


There was a sheen of tears in Harry's eyes as he finished the letter.  He looked at his life-partner of the last 6 years.

""You wonderful, beautiful git!""  Harry sniffed.  Mindless of their audience, Draco hauled him close and kissed him hard.  He pulled back long enough to whisper into Harry's ear.

""You're worth it.""

""We'll have to examine the problem from all sides,"" he told them, ignoring the sniffling bundle nestled in Hagrid's giant arms. ""Consider all the suspects. Eliminate them via 
Veritaserum in trial. Who was the Potter's secret keeper? We kept records for the Order, because, you know, I'm a nutcase, but I'm an organized nutcase.""



McGonagall cleared her throat. ""Pettigrew, I think,"" she said, voice soft and eyes locked on the blackened wood scattered in the street. Godric's Hollow is clear, now, it wasn't hours ago, filled with wizards and witches desperate to tame the flames licking the house and to save the screaming child on the top floor. 



Dumbledore reached up and rested his hand gently on her elbow.



""We'll have to consider Sirius Black as next of kin. As godfather, he's more qualified than anyone to raise their child."" Dumbledore met Hagrid's twinkling beetle-eyes. ""There must have been a reason none of them chose other family.""



And, baby Harry, one-year-old and newly orphaned, gurgled happily.


 

- 11 years later -

 


Harry smiles at his godfather, pictures of his parents tucked in between his potions textbook and his Quidditch magazines in his trunk. His snowy owl hoots softly in her cage, fixing her surroundings with bright yellow eyes. Sirius ruffles his hair affectionately, looking around the platform for the train. 



""I'm glad I didn't get carted off to some estranged sister of my mother's only to be abused for years to come,"" he stops walking, somehow needing to tell Sirius this, make him understand the magnitude of his gratefulness. ""Dumbledore made the rational, adult, informed decision, especially considering I'm almost in no way connected to him.""



Sirius looks at him funny. ""You've got a weird head, kid.""

Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter.




The sound of rainwater falling and the smell of petrichor surrounded him. It was chilly,  yet he felt nothing as he walked around barefooted. Of course it was chilly,  it was the last of August after all, and the autumnal season had just begun. Walking around the grounds of the castle he once called his home, Harry Potter couldn't help but wonder how things had turned into the state they are now. 



Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter. 



What state did he mean exactly? Harry didn't even know.  Did he mean himself? The apathy? Or was it alexithymia? He thought it was possibly just numbness or disconnection. It was just after the war after all, and it was completely understandable why he was so...monotone. 



But 15 years had passed since then and he was 

still 

feeling the same. Fifteen years after the war, 32 year-old Harry James Potter was feeling the same numbness. 



Was it numbness? Alexithymia? Possibly apathy? No, definitely apathy.



Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter. 



Hadn't he asked himself this already? 



Harry didn't know. He didn't particularly care either. 



No, Harry James Potter didn't care. Or was it the lack of feeling the need to care? Anyway, he preferred this. The peace that comes with the lack of emotions. 



Pitter-patter, Pitter-patter, whoosh, pitter-patter,  whoosh



Was it peace? Harry tilted his head as he pondered on the question. The rain was still falling around him, but instead of the heavy downpour, it was now a soft trickling.  There were no students yet, and the teachers hadn't noticed that he was in the castle. Well, of course they wouldn't. They were down in Hogsmeade. 



The winter wind had preceded the clouds that brought the snow in the Scottish Highlands. Did he shiver?If he did, he didn't notice. Peace. Harry had remembered wishing for it when he was a boy, but the reason, he couldn't exactly recall. Was this peace? Living with apathy? It probably was not the same peace his younger self had hoped for, but Harry thought that it didn't matter. No one bothered him anymore, and he's more than happy to accept that. 



Drip, drop, whoosh, drip, drop, whoosh.



The rainfall had slowed even more, and the wind picked up more. He continued to walk around, ignoring the slow build of mud on his feet. 



Clip, clop, clip, clop. 



The sound of hooves caught his attention, and Harry recognised the blond hair of his only centaur friend, Firenze. 



""Hello, Mr. Potter."" 



""Hello, Firenze. How may I help you?"" 



""Oh, no. I'm merely here to say goodbye."" 



Harry blinked, and Firenze saw how the once bright green eyes had lost its spark. 



""Ah, so you know. How, if you don't mind me asking?"" 



""The stars had slightly lost the glow that it received when you were born."" 



Harry merely nodded, and bowed his head in thanks to Firenze before walking away slowly. Firenze bowed behind him, not that Harry saw it, and left, his heart silently breaking for the only male human his tribe has accepted. 



Drip, drop, drip, whoosh, rustle. 



Taking a deep breath, the scent of petrichor was surrounding him, filling his lungs. 



As he walked closer towards the middle of the forest, Harry smiled softly. His end was coming. As if hearing his thoughts, his sole house elf, an old little thing named Koby, popped into his visual range. 



And Koby truly was an old thing. At the age of 200, the only thing keeping him alive was Harry's magic. Harry smiled at the small thing, a smile that looked fond. Was he fond? Maybe. 



If it was, maybe Harry wasn't so apathetic after all.



""Master Harry?"" 



""Hello, Koby. Are you sure you do not wish to bond with another family?"" 



""No, Master Harry. I is very olds, and I wishes to be with my mate."" Koby said, bowing at Harry, his long, floppy ears reaching the ground and scraping the mud. 



""Very well. Please stay in Gringotts. And do send my thanks and final regards to Ragnok."" Harry said, petting the small grey tuft of hair on top of Koby's head. 



With a pop, Koby disappeared and reappeared within the halls of Gringotts, where all house elves waited for their end. 



Ragnok just bowed solemnly. Harry had been the only human that had shown the goblin horde the respect that the Wizarding world had not given them. 



Drip, drop, whoosh, drip, drop.



The middle of the forest was a clearing, with a soft bed of flowers at the very centre. 



Lilies, how fitting. 



Taking out his wand, Harry laid on the bed of lilies and took his wand out and pointed it to himself.



A deep breath, a flick of the wand, and a murmur of his words, Harry James Potter spoke his last words. 



""

Avada Kedavra.

"" 



Harry knew no more, and Koby softly closed his eyes as the magic finally left him.

Had it been a different situation Remus would have made a deer in headlights joke, but this didn't seem to be the time.


""Harry!"" Sirius cried out, though he had absolutely no idea what to say to the poor kid. It didn't matter anyway, the boy was long gone from the bedroom door. Sirius covered himself up even more with the blanket and groaned. Remus tried to offer some comfort by rubbing his back as his husband tried to disappear into a ball and again groaned into his knees. Sirius Black had been through a lot of terrible things in his life, but at right that moment he wasn't sure any of them compared to having his visiting godson walk in on him and Remus having sex. The two had both gotten up early to get a few things done before Harry woke up, but they had ended up getting...distracted, and apparently also losing track of time. Sirius was absolutely mortified. A soft chuckle came from beside him.


""It could have been worse."" The defeated Black looked up.


""HOW could it have been worse Moony?"" Sirius barked incredulously. Remus smirked.


""He could have walked in about ten minutes ago when we were-"" Sirius frantically threw his hand over his husband's mouth in horror.


""He could still be within earshot! Do you want to traumatize him more?!"" Remus huffed a laugh and pushed Sirius' hand away.


""Okay first of all he's definitely nowhere near this room right now,"" There was another pitiful groan from Sirius. ""And secondly,"" Remus continued, rolling his eyes, ""he'll be fine. Yeah he's a little shaken up right now but it'll blow over. Lots of kids walk in on stuff like this. Didn't you ever walk in on your parents?"" Sirius shook his head adamantly.


""I'm not convinced my parents ever had sex. I'm pretty sure Reg and I were conjured by black magic fully two years old with perfect posture."" Remus snorted a laugh and even Sirius had to smile at his own joke. Remus rolled his eyes again and smiled.


""Okay well either way, I'm sure he's fine. We didn't scar him for life, I promise."" Sirius sighed, pondering the ethics of obliviating a child, but then he perked up.


""You're right,"" he said, looking like he was putting pieces of some unknown puzzle together. ""He probably doesn't even know what he saw! Okay, we need to get out stories straight. We'll say that-"" This time it was Remus' turn to cut off his husband.


""Woah, woah, that's not what I meant."" He started. ""He definitely knows what we were doing; Sirius he's ten.""


""Exactly, he's ten!"" Sirius said excitedly. Remus appraised him with a strange look.


""Pads..."" he began, almost hesitant to ask, ""when did you learn about sex?"" Sirius looked away.


""Well...I actually found out about it from some of the older boys at Hogwarts. A group of sixth years were telling some bawdy jokes in the common room our second year and I asked them to explain them,"" He admitted with a blush. Quickly looking at Remus he added ""But Harry hasn't been to Hogwarts yet, he's never been around that!"" Remus looked like he was starting to assemble his own mental puzzle.


""Sirius, when did your parents tell you about sex?"" Sirius thought about it for a second and then replied,


""Oh at the usual age I guess, probably sixteen?""


""Sixteen!"" Remus nearly shouted. Sirius looked confused.


""Yeah?"" He said, ""Why? When did you learn about sex?""


""Well I mean they didn't tell me everything but I at least knew the basics at about seven.""


""Seven!"" Sirius did in fact shout.


""It's not like they went into great detail!"" Remus countered. ""They just told me where it was that babies came from and how they got there. Then as I got older a few times over the years they told me what they thought was appropriate for me to know at that point, like what to expect and how to be safe."" Sirius looked completely flabbergasted.


""So they just,"" he heaved out, ""like, they just told you about sex? When you were still a kid? And then they told you MORE as you got older?"" He ran his hand through his long black hair and shook his head incredulously. ""But, but you weren't even anywhere close to old enough to have sex!""


""No,"" Remus nodded, ""I wasn't, but they wanted to make sure that when I was I would be informed enough to make good decisions. And they thought that I should know about something so important to a lot of species and to a lot of people."" Over the years Remus had become pretty familiar with elite Pureblood customs and how absurd they were, so part of him was not really surprised that the major families did not tell their kids about sex until it was near time to start the betrothal process to produce another perfect heir. He imagined a tense conversation in a formal room, filled with lecture and shame. It was like he could actually see it. Another part of him however was still shocked at just how preposterous most of the moneyed Purebloods could be. He did however know a few moneyed Purebloods he respected immensely, and as two of them were named Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, he very much doubted that James had grown up with a similar sexual education to the Blacks and thus probably didn't raise his own son in ignorance. And even if he had, Remus thought, there's no way Lily would have let that cycle continue. This was all becoming clear to Sirius as well, who put his head in his hands.


""Prongs is gonna kill us."" he mumbled. Remus laughed.


""Come on, let's go find Harry and talk to him before he gets too awkward to look at us.""







The two found Harry in the room that was universally agreed to be his own, despite the fact that he did not actually live there. They knocked on the door and heard a mumbled answer. Remus went in first, slowly opening the door with a shy smile. He'd put on one of his warm beige jumpers with his jeans in an effort to seem as friendly and unthreatening as possible. Sirius on the other hand was wearing one of his old band tee shirts along with his ripped black jeans and his hair up in a bun, which was about as soft a look as he ever wore.


""Hey Prongslet."" he smiled softly, and Harry grumbled a reply. Sirius looked at Remus and then back to Harry. ""Can we sit down?"" Harry didn't say anything but he pulled his legs up closer to his chest to make room for them on the bed. As he rested his chin on his knees and looked at his godparents, Sirius couldn't help but smile at his messy hair and the glasses set askew on his face. Remus smiled too.


""So,"" Remus started, not entirely sure where to begin, ""I guess we should probably talk about what happened, but we don't really know what exactly to talk about, so I guess if there's somewhere you want to start we can just go there."" He thought it seemed like a reasonable solution to get an awkward conversation started. Harry looked at his feet and nodded. He was quiet for a few seconds before he said,


""So...are you trying to have a baby?""


Of the many many things that they had expected Harry to say, that was not one of them.


""What?"" Sirius nearly coughed. All of Remus' possible answers were about as eloquent.


""You guys were..."" Harry swallowed, ""You know, um, having sex,"" he forced out, ""and Mom and Dad said that that's how a couple make a baby.""


""Well,"" Remus said at quite a loss for words, ""That's, that's true, um,"" Harry started up again, this time much faster.


""Is it gonna cry a lot? Is it gonna be gross and spit up on everything? Are you guys gonna be too busy with it to spend time with me? Are you gonna give it my room?"" He took a breath and tried not to let his voice falter. ""Can I still come over once the baby's here?""


""Woah, hey,"" Sirius interjected, putting his hand on Harry's foot. He looked so small. Sirius looked him in the eye. ""Nobody is replacing you.""


""Never."" Remus agreed. ""No one ever could."" Harry looked up at them both and smiled weakly.


""And nobody is having any baby."" Sirius said, moving to the second most impossible thing the boy had assumed. Harry looked confused.


""You're not?"" Sirius shook his head.


""That's not exactly how it works, Harry."" Remus said gently. ""Tell us, what exactly do you know about sex?"" Harry explained to them what James and Lily had told him about the mechanics of how babies are conceived. ""They said that it was what couples did when they got married and they wanted to have children."" Harry looked embarrassed for a moment and looked down. ""And, then later I, uh,"" he blushed.


""It's okay,"" Remus assured him, ""there's nothing to be embarrassed about I promise."" Harry was still blushing but he managed to look up slightly.


""I asked what about couples like you guys, that you know, match?"" The corners of both Sirius and Remus' mouths twitched up at their godson's childlike description. It was so simple to him, no confusion, no politics, just simple. They continued to listen to Harry and that's when it became clear exactly which wires had gotten crossed. ""Dad said it was not all that different, and then explained what, um, changes about it."" Harry finished with another slight blush. Remus and Sirius glanced at each other and both knew what had happened. James, being somewhat absent-minded as he was and also at least a few hours removed from the initial conversation, had forgotten that Harry only knew the very very basics of what sex was for and hadn't realized his son was asking how did gay couples have children.


""Okay,"" Sirius said, still pretty uncomfortable with the situation himself, ""I think you misunderstood what your dad meant."" Harry cocked his head at his godfather. ""Couples that um, match, biologically speaking, can't make a baby together."" Harry looked between Sirius and Remus a few times in confusion.


""But,"" he asked, ""but if you can't have a baby, why were you having sex?"" Remus shifted uncomfortably as Sirius fought the urge to bolt into the woods, big black and dog-like, and just never be seen again.


""Well,"" Sirius nearly squeaked. He didn't think he could do this. Luckily Remus took the question.


""Because, uh, well, sex is a way to show someone how much you love them."" He started as Harry listened, a little confused but also a little curious. Remus continued. ""It's certainly not the only way, or even the only intimate way, but it is one means to express deep feelings in a way that is just between you and the other person. It's a way to show love that is intimate and private, with both people working together to show that they love each other and make them feel nice."" Harry nodded slowly.


""Okay, I think I understand. So, it feels nice because you're with the person you love and they love you. And that's why you do it?""


""Well, yes,"" Remus confirmed, ""but there's also that it, uh, the actual activity, sort of,"" Remus was starting to lose the confidence he had seemed to have earlier and Sirius was afraid it might be his turn to step up and save his husband.


""Having sex is,"" Sirius cut in, ""...pleasant."" He cast a glance at Remus who nodded at him slightly. ""It can definitely be a big emotional thing like Moony said, but it doesn't always have to be. Sometimes a couple will have sex because they enjoy it, and doing something you enjoy together is also a way to show love.""


""Yeah,"" Remus agreed with a soft smile, ""Sometimes it can just be a way for people who love each other to spend time in a nice way.""


""Oh,"" Harry said. ""I think that makes sense."" He hesitated for a second. ""I still think it's kind of weird though."" He admitted quietly. Remus laughed slightly.


""That's okay. It is sort of a strange thing. And it is usually a rather private thing, but it isn't anything that anyone has to be embarrassed about. Most people have sex at some point and continue having sex and that's perfectly fine. And some people don't like sex or don't care one way or the other and that's okay too. If and how somebody has sex is up to them and their partner and its their business."" Harry nodded.


""I'm sorry I walked in on you guys, I didn't mean to mess up your privacy."" Remus smiled.


""It's okay kid. Just knock next time.""


""Deal.""


""Is that everything?"" Remus asked. Harry looked around awkwardly again. Luckily, Sirius had spent a lifetime having questions he didn't know how to ask, and so he knew exactly what was on the boy's mind.


""People like it for sort of the same reason some people like roller coasters."" He answered without having to be asked. Harry made a face.


""I don't like going on roller coasters."" He said. Sirius laughed and ruffled his hair.


""Me neither kid. I don't have anything to do with them. And you shouldn't have anything to do with sex until you're older. Much older."" He emphasized with another laugh, finally getting Harry to relax and giggle slightly. ""You're too young for all that. But it's okay to be curious and to ask questions."" He looked at Remus who was smiling approvingly. ""You are old enough for that.""


""Come on,"" Remus said, ""Let's go get some breakfast and then you can go see if the neighbors will let you play with that new puppy.""


""Really?"" Harry asked excitedly as they stood up. Sirius frowned.


""I don't like that dog Moony,"" he said, the picture of concerned skepticism. Remus smirked.


""You don't like any dog with softer fur than you Padfoot."" Harry burst out laughing as Sirius gasped dramatically, wounded to the very core. Harry wrapped his arms around the offended animagus and grinned.


""Don't worry Padfoot, you're still my favorite."" Sirius hugged him back and stuck his tongue out at his laughing husband, before Harry challenged him to a race downstairs. The two took off like rockets, tripping and laughing over each other and away from Remus' calls to be careful and slow down.







Later that night after Harry had left the two were laying in bed. Despite what Sirius had feared James and Lily were not actually mad. Lily had barely even been surprised, saying she should have expected something like this to happen to the two Marauders, and James had found the whole thing hilarious. It looked like Harry had gotten out unscarred and any lingering awkwardness would soon be forgotten. In truth everything was fine, but one thing still bothered them.


""The door was locked."" Remus said into the dark.


""Yeah."" Sirius agreed. The door really had been locked. ""I'm sure of it.""


""Me too, cause I'm the one who locked it.""


""What? No, I locked the door.""


""No, Pads, I did. I distinctly remember that I locked the door when you were kissing me up against it.


""No,"" Sirius countered, ""I locked it when you had ME up against the door.""


""No, I-"" Remus stopped short and started laughing. ""Oh my gosh, do you see what happened?""


""What, no?""


""We both turned the lock! One of us turned it one way and the other one must have turned it the other way.""


""Oh my gosh,"" Sirius groaned. ""We locked and then unlocked the door."" At that point they were both laughing.


""We're so stupid."" Remus shook his head with a grin. Sirius nodded and snuggled up closer to his husband, putting his head on his chest.


""Yeah, but we're stupid together."" Remus laid his hand in Sirius' hair and kissed the top of his head. Sirius hummed in content and Remus smiled.


""I wouldn't have it any other way."""

Maybe then she would have had a few more moments of rest before having to dirty her own hands again.

Damn her wedding vows. She sneered slightly when the Auror fumbled as he took hold of her offered wand, cloak, and papers. He then turned to handle them in another room, leaving her alone in the visitor's room.

At least some things didn't change. It had cost her a ridiculous number of galleons just to secure this 'highly supervised' visit to Azkaban. But as ever, the bureaucrats only talked a hard game. Their follow through was as lackluster as always. 

Narcissa swiftly pulled out a second wand from her bespelled earring. The inexperienced fool hadn't thought to demand her jewelry, choosing to only confiscate her more obvious belongings.

Raising it swiftly, she wove a complex curse and sent it straight towards the Auror's retreating back.

The wizard paused and looked back, but Narcissa had already hidden the wand within the folds of her skirt.

While the Auror continued on his way to verify her paperwork and stow away her belongings, Narcissa took the opportunity to pull out an invisibility cloak from the other undetectable storage in her wedding ring and tug it on.

Without dementors, the prison had been left understaffed. There was no second guard to watch over her, only depending on a simple locking spell on the visitor cell's metal door. Narcissa settled herself against the wall next to the door. 

Now all she had to do was wait for pandemonium to begin.

The curse she used was an old Malfoy special. One ciphered in blood magic and explicitly warned not to be used without taking extensive protective measures. Her precious boy offered to burn the lot--their family couldn't be found holding such knowledge nowadays. But Narcissa told him, ""Not yet. Tell me more first."" 

The curse was meant to ensure a wizard stayed true to the family. But it noted that the effects were too unpredictable and the results, too uncontrollable. And not worth testing again when it decimated the entire branch family whose son it had been used on.

Narcissa didn't read too much into the effects. She was sold when Draco cited just how quickly the curse spread from victim to victim. According to the records, even casting a simple warming charm was enough to pass it onto someone else. There were also notes observing a physical altercation worked just as well.

Yes, she could have used  Imperius instead, but Narcissa was feeling a tad nihilistic. She hoped one of the cursed Aurors would report at the Ministry and spread the mayhem. To see how much destruction it wrought on the fools who thought themselves free to celebrate their victory.

Narcissa watched as the Auror returned and found her missing. The rookie panicked, calling for his fellow Aurors. He hadn't bothered checking if she was still inside the locked cell. 

A few of his colleagues came running in. ""Halt please!"" The rookie called out, ""Identify yourself first."" The group cast identification spells on each other. They asked what the emergency was and Auror Stanley replied, ""Narcissa Malfoy's gone missing. I left her here in the visitor's cell to check in her belongings and submit the paperwork but when I returned, she was gone.""

""Let's check the prisoners are accounted for. And activate the second tier wards on the cells."" One of them ran off to do the latter. The others set about casting similar identification spells on the prisoners. 

When that was done, the Auror Stanley finally opened the door of the visitor's cell and stepped inside. Narcissa slipped right out behind him--the fool left the door open behind him. Side-stepping the other three who had come to help, Narcissa waited.

It didn't take long for the curse to do its job.

One by one, the small group of Aurors lost sight of their original goal.

Instead of investigating, they started to rise up to the prisoners' increasingly vulgar taunts.

First with jeers and swears of their own, then with stinging hexes, and finally with repeated stunners. Any stronger, darker spells were prevented by the measures they had just enacted.

When some of the prisoners proved resilient to a  Stupefy, the Aurors gave up all pretense and started to undo the wards forcibly. One of them must have been a Senior Auror. Newly promoted no doubt.

For several minutes, Narcissa witnessed a mimicry of the Dark Lord's revels. Except the heroes were the butchers and the villains were sheep to the slaughter.

Only one of the compromised Aurors lingered to play; the rest preferred to curse fatally and move on to the next. A small riot broke out when a prisoner wrestled a wand away from his tormentor. But he soon dropped dead and the riled up survivors continued on.

When they finally reached her husband's cell, all of them dueled for the right to kill him. Narcissa found the victor unexpected; the lanky redhead was the youngest of the bunch. A Weasley so maybe not so surprising. There were few who hated her family more.

Not that it mattered. When Auror Weasley finally finished undoing the wards, Narcissa hissed  Avada Kedavra  without hesitation. The boy fell on the spot, his eyes open and unseeing.

The other Aurors didn't notice, having already moved on further down the hall to access the next group of prisoners. A brief tussle ensued when they came across another patrolling Auror who had kept to his post.

The Malfoys waited motionlessly. When the screams started up again, Narcissa lowered her hood.

Lucius's eyes gleamed sharply. ""Narcissa,"" he rasped. Her husband strode out of his cell with only a fraction of his usual haughtiness.

""Darling,"" she drawled, ""It's time to go. Draco is already waiting at the chateau.""

With pale skeletal hands, he shakily pulled on the invisibility cloak Narcissa offered him. He looked absolutely ghastly after only a few months in prison.

Invisible once more, Narcissa tucked her hand into the crook of Lucius's bony elbow and the two Malfoys strolled out of the newly reformed prison.

Behind them, Azkaban stood silent once more.

 

 

It was Halloween today--hopefully, Harry's first uneventful experience now that Voldemort was finally dead.

The Boy-Who-Lived had chosen to return to Hogwarts with Hermione to re-do his Seventh Year. Ron had been disappointed but stuck with his decision to go straight into the Auror Corps to forge his own path. The Golden Trio was down to two this year.

Despite this, Harry remained upbeat and optimistic for a good year. It has been so far.

He was Head Boy alongside Hermione as Head Girl. Professor McGonagall was reinstated as Headmistress and was being particularly lenient on all returning Seventh Year veterans.

Not that Harry was slacking. He was doing much better this year than he thought he would be--there was a strange peace in studying. It quieted his mind and kept it from... well other things.

Plus, Hermione was particularly pleased by his newfound interest in academia.

Bill had taken up the vacant DADA professor spot and Fleur had taken up Transfiguration. He trusted neither of them were going to try to kill him. Slughorn had come out of retirement once more to teach Potions--just until Prof. McGonagall found a proper replacement.

Harry also tried rekindling his relationship with Ginny but they didn't last longer than a week. Ginny was the one to call it quits first. She said the feelings just weren't there anymore--and suspected he was of the same mind.

He had agreed a little too quickly. Ginny zeroed in on it and dug out Harry's budding feelings for Hermione. Thankfully, instead of hexing him, Ginny simply hugged him and bid him good luck.

It didn't take long before Ginny was going steady with Neville after that. Harry was happy for the both of them.

Bolstered by Ginny's approval, Harry had even gotten Ron's blessings before the redhead was shipped off to guard Azkaban on his first Auror assignment. The trio had reunited for a night at Hogwarts with Prof. McGonagall's permission.

That was nearly three weeks ago.

Harry had yet plucked up the courage to confess--he was thinking closer to Christmas... OK so he was dragging his feet. He just didn't want to mess it up. It was Hermione after all.

Hermione who deserved only the best after all the crap he put her through at his side.

A piercing shriek cut through his meandering thoughts and Harry jerked upright, knocking over his pumpkin juice.

Hermione placed a concerned hand on his arm, ""What's wrong Harry?""

It had been Hermione's scream. A memory then. Harry couldn't tell if it was the original or the many that echoed in their dorm when she was having a nightmare.

Before Harry could respond, the Great Hall doors slammed open. Professor McGonagall was arriving late to the Halloween feast.

The hall quieted down. The Headmistress was unusually unkempt. Her hair bun was half undone, spectacles missing, and cloak lopsided as if she had put it back on in a great rush.

McGonagall stated the school was to be on lockdown until further notice, causing a ripple of unease to rapidly spread throughout the Great Hall.

""What's the meaning of this Minerva?"" Professor Flitwick asked.

""Settle down everyone. This is merely a precaution. I just spent the day at the Ministry on official business and was informed there was a riot of sorts at Azkaban. The DMLE is still working on getting a clearer picture of the situation and the news has not yet gone to the public. But with our new and improved protections in place, I can assure all of you that any escapee will be kept out of our hallowed halls. No one comes in, and no one goes out.""

Harry and Hermione silently glanced at each other and prayed Ron was alright. When the feast ended, Harry watched as Hermione quickly penned a letter to check up on their friend.

 

 

As it turned out, lockdown for the student body had very little impact on their daily routines. The only notable changes were the cancellation of all Hogsmeade weekends until further notice and the extra trips students had to make to the Owlery for outgoing letters. Only official Hogwarts owls were allowed to pass the protective dome etched around Hogwarts.

Other than that, students went about their boarding school life with nary a protest. Most of the students actually approved of the overreaching measures needed to keep them all safe--anything was better than last year. 

Inbound mail was collected and monitored by House Elves from the Owlery and distributed at breakfast per usual. Students still got their daily Quibbler and Witch Weekly copies--the Prophet no longer the paper of choice for their bias during Voldemort's second rise.

Nothing in the news stood out. The riot was mentioned but swept under the fold because no escapees were reported by the Ministry. Other than that, it was the same old stories. Someone got murdered, someone got into a duel with someone else, some activist group was picketing something or another, some Muggles witnessed a wizard performing magic, etc.

Some grumbled when their families stopped writing, but no one thought it was related. Harry and Hermione never got a reply from Ron, but Ginny mentioned offhand that her parents had written to her. They hadn't mentioned Ron at all, much less whether he had gotten injured or worse. So the duo assumed Ron must have been too busy and forgot to write back.

It didn't take more than a week for most of the student body to forget they were in lockdown at all.

Well, until students started to go missing.

Eve Cattermole was the first. The Headmistress made the announcement to request for information when her roommates reported Eve missing from both her classes and dorms. But no one had seen her.

The next to disappear was Terry Boot nearly a week later. Harry tried scouring the Marauder's Map for the two but found nothing.

Two days later, a Fourth Year Slytherin failed to show for Potions class. And a day later, a Sixth Year Gryffindor fell victim.

The last two were reportedly missing within hours of each other--Parvati Patil and Dennis Creevey.

Six students of various ages, genders, and Houses seemingly disappeared into thin air.

By then everyone was wondering what the lockdown measures were even for.

McGonagall told the students not to panic, that the professors were doing everything in their power to find the missing children.

The professors canceled classes for the day. While Prof. McGonagall and Hagrid prowled the grounds, the Weasley professors interviewed all students who had reportedly been the last to see the victims before their disappearances. The rest of the adults took predetermined sections of the castle and scoured it for clues.

Classes resumed without news, only another announcement stating that they were still looking into the matter. However, an early 8 PM curfew was initiated and students were warned to stick together going forward.

The student body hunkered down.

 

 

It'd only been three days since the professors searched the castle when Hermione came to Harry looking rather shifty. ""Harry, can I talk to you in our dorm? Alone?"" Hermione must have just come back from her impromptu meeting with Professor McGonagall.

Harry assumed he hadn't been invited because he was supposed to be hosting Quidditch practice like a responsible captain at the time. But Harry hadn't wanted to leave Hermione by herself and she refused to go to the pitch in the rain. So he ditched practice and stayed inside of his room.

After the professor left, Harry came out of his room and offered to go with her anyway but Hermione refused. She'll be fine, she said. Instead, she told him to wait at the library and to sit at a table within Madam Pince's eyesight. She didn't want him to be alone either.

Harry insisted on walking her to the gargoyle before heading to the library afterward.

Shaking his irrelevant thoughts aside, Harry finally responded ""Of course, lead the way."" He flicked his wand and his stuff quickly packed themselves into his bag.

Hermione grabbed his hand, and Harry gripped it in surprise. Her hand was clammy and she was peering up at him with what looked almost like hope in her eyes.

For a brief moment, he entertained the idea that Hermione was going to make the first move. Both Ginny and Neville had been egging him on ever since Harry told the former about his feelings; Around two weeks ago, Ginny had confronted him asking why he still hadn't made a move. Apparently, Hermione had just a big of a crush as he did and Ginny couldn't understand why they were still pussyfooting around it. Harry wasn't able to do much more than stammer and beg her to lower her voice.

Harry would have definitely preferred awkward romantic confessions over the conversation that really followed.

After they got to the dorms, Hermione cast multiple privacy spells, locked the door, blocked the fireplace, and closed the curtains over all of the windows.

His eyebrows rose at her paranoia.

Only after she was satisfied did she blurt out, ""Something's wrong with Professor McGonagall!""

""What do you mean?""

""I thought she just wanted to catch up on how the Yule Ball preparations were coming along or something. But oh Merlin, I think she's behind the missing students Harry!""

 

 


- TWENTY MINUTES AGO -


Hermione took a seat across from the Headmistress after giving her salutations. She leaned down to pet one of the new cats in the office, a pretty Bengal that she hadn't seen before. The cat swiped at her and Hermione snatched her hand away just in time. ""Not a very friendly kitty are you,"" Hermione whispered.

The cat came back after a moment and rubbed her head against Hermione's hand, purring. Hermione smiled and was strangely reminded of Parvati when she looked into the cat's brown eyes. It was a startling dark shade that didn't occur with normal cats. Perhaps it was just a transfiguration.

""Miss Granger,"" the Headmistress finally greeted, drawing Hermione's attention back, ""Thank you for coming in on such short notice. Unfortunately, this whole missing student business has taken up most of my time. But I saw an opportunity and couldn't resist. Harry's at Quidditch isn't he? I'm sure you felt lonely in his absence?""

""Oh not at all, Professor."" Hermione could barely keep the frown from her face. What a strange thing for her to ask.

Prof. McGonagall changed the subject, ""So how are your classes coming along?""

""Wonderfully. Bill and Fleur have really taken to their new roles--though I do miss your style of teaching at times. I am glad Professor Slughorn agreed to come out of retirement again. He's loads better than--"" Hermione realized Professor Snape portrait was right there and quickly corrected herself, ""I mean I feel more prepared for my NEWTs than ever before."" A snort resounded from her left and Hermione flushed with embarrassment.

She hastily continued, ""It has taken some adjustment to finish Arithmancy and Astronomy through owl correspondence. Especially with all those extra trips to the Owlery. It's really unfortunate that Professor Sinistra and Professor Vector chose not to return this year.""

""Ah yes. Sadly, both of my colleagues needed more time to recover still and there just wasn't enough interest to fill those roles before the year started. It was a hard decision, but for the best.""

McGonagall poured hot tea into the awaiting cups and handed one to Hermione. She stared rather expectantly at the younger witch but Hermione didn't exactly hear a question to respond to.

So she fidgeted and played with her cup before glancing around the changed office. Most of the portraits were missing. Instead, there was a wide variety of cat trees and cat perches decorating the office now. Along with six cats Hermione had never seen before. ""Are all of these cats yours Professor?""

An almost fanatic smile stretched across the old madam's face, distorting it in a way that had Hermione's nape hairs rising in trepidation. ""Yes. They're all mine. A beautiful collection don't you think?""

She bent down to pick one of them up--an orange tabby--and hissed when the cat proceeded to maul her dominant hand with its teeth and claws. ""Mr. Boot! How dare you--"" The cat hissed, his back arching defensively.

Hermione's eyes widened for an instant. Her brain fired away. Boot. Terry Boot. An unnaturally colored cat. Parvati. Six cats, six students.

She quickly masked her reaction, ""Mr. Boot? Like Puss-in-the-Boots? I am surprised you know of the Muggle film. I quite liked it myself.""

McGonagall narrowed her eyes at Hermione's carefully guileless expression. ""Perhaps. He came named as such prior to my possession but I'm sure I'll find a better name for him soon.""

Hermione glanced at the still bleeding wounds, ""Perhaps you should have Madam Pomfrey look at..."" She gestured to the Headmistress's wounds. Hermione listened to her gut and refrained from offering to heal them herself.

Prof. McGonagall glared at the still dripping wounds. ""I suppose I should. Please stay and drink your tea Miss Granger. I'll be right back in a moment."" She exited without waiting for Hermione's reply.

Hermione brought the shaking cup to her lips but jolted when Professor Snape's portrait hissed, ""Don't drink the bloody tea Miss Granger. Use that insufferable brain of yours and connect the dots you idiot. Leave and don't come back here. Minerva is under some kind of curse. Run before she comes back.""

The warning had Hermione sniffing the tea and paling. It smelt of Dreamless Sleep. The cup clattered onto the ground, its contents soaking into the carpet. ""Professor...""

""Leave you foolish girl! Quickly!"" Professor Snape barked.

Hermione fled back to the only safety she could think of.

 

 

""...I'm pretty sure she turned them into cats Harry!"" Hermione hyperventilated, ""She knows that I know now. Since I didn't drink the tea. Harry, what do I do?""

""Calm down Hermione. If Professor McGonagall is under a curse, let's go to Bill. He was a curse-breaker before he picked up the professorship remember? He can help.""

Hermione finally breathed properly. ""Yes. Right. Bill. He and Fleur will surely know what to do."" She graced Harry with a relieved smile, ""Thanks Harry. I knew I could depend on you.""

Harry's heart fluttered and he flushed red, ""Yes well... I thought it was only right to return the favor. Since I'm usually the one depending on you and all.""

Hermione brushed a chaste kiss on his cheek before grabbing his hand again to tug him towards the door. Harry felt like he was floating on cloud nine the entire way to Bill's office.

 

 

Harry watched as Hermione knocked on the dark mahogany door. Bill was surprised to see the two of them but warmly invited them in anyway. ""You know you two shouldn't be out and about right? It's past curfew.""

""I think Professor McGonagall is under some kind of curse,"" Hermione blurted out, ""I'm fairly certain she turned Terry Boot, Parvati Patil, and the four other missing students into cats! They're trapped in her office. And she's set her eyes on me next. I-I wouldn't be here if Professor Snape's portrait hadn't warned me to leave.""

The DADA professor blinked in astonishment, ""Why would the Headmistress turn a bunch of students into cats for?""

""I don't know,"" Hermione replied miserably, ""But I  swear  I smelt the scent of a sleeping potion in my cup. The valerian was unmistakable. Plus Professor Snape's portrait told me not to drink it--he's the one who said she was under a curse...""

""Look--I know you two are probably worried about the missing students. I am too. But we haven't found any signs of foul play. Or signs of an escaped convict. At this point, we honestly think they might have gotten trapped into some unknown room that only shows up under certain circumstances. A bunch were reported during the restoration remember? We've been doing sweeps of classrooms, closets, and windows on our assigned floors every morning, in between classes, and at night. Professor McGonagall was the one to arrange it and takes twice as many shifts as the rest of us--""

Harry piped up in her defense, ""Please Bill, could you just double-check? Surely it wouldn't hurt to make sure? It's Hermione after all! She wouldn't accuse McGonagall of something like this without good reason.""

Bill settled back down, ""Right. Sorry, Hermione. Very well, I'll see if I can catch Minerva tonight. Fleur and I have the patrol shift after hers and Trelawney's. I'm sure it's nothing.""

The oldest Weasley then gave Hermione a look of pity, ""It's not that I don't trust you Hermione--it's just you look rather stressed. I know you're taking literally every NEWT aside from Divination but a good night's sleep might do you wonders.""

Hermione lowered her eyes and Harry could tell she was trying to hide her resentment. NEWTs had little to do with the bags under her eyes. Sleep was hard to come by when she was still plagued by nightmares of the war.

""Of course,"" she said in a falsely happy tone, ""I'll head to bed soon. Just... just be careful OK? If she  is  under a curse, she might react negatively to your inquiries...""

Bill patted her on the shoulder and Harry winced, ""It's not my first... what's the word? Road? Rode? Oh, Rodeo. I promise I'll handle this with all due diligence. Plus Fleur will be there to ensure I don't go in half-cocked."" Hermione was only marginally reassured.

Harry tugged Hermione towards the door and replied for the both of them, ""Thanks Bill. Goodnight, give Fleur our regards as well.""

""Will do. Have a good one you two. Do try to stay out of trouble.""

 

 

 

By the time the two of them reached their dorm, Hermione's worry hung like a visible cloud around her. She sighed heavily.

Harry dared to pull her into a tight hug, ""It'll be OK Hermione. We beat Voldemort. Whatever this new threat is, we'll beat it too.""

She squeezed back, ""I really hope so Harry.""

They bid each other goodnight.

 

 

The next day, anyone entering the Great Hall for breakfast was greeted with the hanging body of one Professor Trelawney. A dark, coagulated stain spread out underneath her, courtesy of her slit wrists. The wall behind her was marred by words written in blood:

""Shadows have encroached on the waning light this Hallows' Eve. The muddled need take what they desire lest purity will always conquer."" 

The Firsties who happened on the scene screamed their heads off. Others loitered around the entrance, glancing furtively for a professor to arrive while whispering frantically to one another. Some of them were kind enough to block off any new kids from viewing the morbid scene. A pair of Sixth Years ran to get Harry and Hermione. Others ran to check the professors' offices.

At the sound of frantic banging, Harry and Hermione scurried out of their dorm. The panting students could only wheeze out ""G-Great Hall."" The two Heads rushed off accordingly, both clutching their wands in white-knuckled grips for battle. When they skidded to a stop at the back of the growing crowd, they pushed their way to the front.

When they saw the swaying body hanging from a chandelier, Hermione gasped and Harry ashened.

""Oh Merlin,"" Ginny exclaimed, having tailed behind them with Neville.

Finally, a professor came through the staff entrance--Professor Slughorn. The poor man missed a step, blinked twice, and fainted dead away. The students stared.

The rest of the professors filed in soon after. First came Professor Flitwick--who jumped a foot into the air and then immediately cut the rope to bring his colleague's body down and out of sight. Then came the Weasleys, followed by Prof. McGonagall and Prof. Sprout. Strangely enough, Filch and Madam Pince trailed in close behind them.

Fleur cast a  Patronus  to send for Madam Pomfrey. Professor McGonagall stared silently at the words splattered across the wall. Madam Pince looked green. Filch stared at the floor like he desperately wished he had magic to summon a scrubber in order to start attacking the stains.

Professor Sprout went about reviving Professor Slughorn, and Bill finally cast a bunch of spells that brought up a privacy wall, separating the professors from their onlookers.

Hermione clutched helplessly at Harry's hand. If Harry still held any delusions of an ordinary final year at Hogwarts, they were thoroughly shattered that morning.

Classes were canceled again and the students were redirected back to their common rooms. There they all murmured and speculated behind closed doors on what could have happened. About what those words on the wall meant.

Some assumed Prof. Trelawney had done it for a final hurrah after having finally lost her mind. Others defended the old Professor, saying it had to be some kind of warning. There were still six missing students--the timing couldn't just be a coincidence. Maybe whoever or whatever got the students, got Trelawney too.

Harry and Hermione were among the latter. They took the opportunity to invite all returning DA members to the Head dormitory for a private meeting. Hermione was insistent on it since Prof. McGonagall was bound to be occupied with Prof. Trelawney's mysterious death.

It was a rather large group consisting of Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Dean, Padma, Seamus, Luna, Justin, Michael, Hannah, Ernie, and Susan. Harry was relieved he still had so many friends in the castle.

Dean started them all off with, ""So do you think she really hung herself, or is there a murderer on the loose again?""

Ginny voiced her own doubts about Trelawney's staged suicide, ""...There was a lot of blood. I don't know if she could have written all of those words while bleeding and then have the strength to hang herself afterward. A bit excessive to be honest.""

""She could have used animal blood?"" Hermione offered, thinking back to their Second Year. A more morbid thought came to mind as well, ""Or it could be someone else's blood?""

""I've seen memories of Prof. Trelawney making her real prophecies. She goes into a trance and doesn't remember them afterward. There's no way she could have written it on the wall if she had been the one prophesying,"" Harry asserted. ""There had to be someone else involved.""

Seamus paled and continued that train of thought, ""So, we should go on the assumption there's a dark wizard or witch somewhere on Hogwarts grounds. Maybe someone  did  escape from that Azkaban incident on Halloween. The words reference  Hallows' Eve --that'd be Halloween.""

A number of them grew afraid at the thought.

""But McGonagall put the school on lockdown right when she returned..."" Susan protested weakly.

Neville added to the theory, ""Maybe they got in before she got back. After all, the riot didn't happen  on Halloween. She only found out about it then.""

Padma wrangled her hands, ""They're probably behind the student disappearances right? I mean we searched everywhere and they didn't even show up on Harry's map."" The Marauder's Map was an open secret among their friends due to the disappearances. With every missing student, both Harry and Hermione had poured over the old parchment for some sign of them. None of their names had shown up.

The Patil twin continued in a whisper of fear, ""Do you think... do you think that means they're...they're...  dead  too?"" The poor girl looked close to tears. Dean drew her into a hug to comfort her.

Hermione glanced at Harry and he nodded, prompting her to tell them her real theory. ""No. I don't think she's dead Padma."" Hermione's voice hitched for a second before she could continue, ""I-I think Professor McGonagall is behind this. She's been cursed somehow--and I think she transfigured the six missing students into cats. Something experimental maybe since they didn't show up on the Map.""

The whole group minus Harry stared at her like she had gone barmy.

""I'm serious. We already asked Professor Weasley to double-check last night. Prof. McGonagall came back looking out of sorts on Halloween remember? Right before she called the school into lockdown? What if it wasn't to keep others out but to keep us in? No one would suspect her. It...It would make sense if it was McGonagall.""

The group glanced helplessly at each other. If the Headmistress was under a curse, who could they reach out to that they could trust?

Harry tried his best to step up, ""Look, just be careful around the Headmistress. Don't go taking tea with her alone. Make your excuses and keep the rest of the students away whenever possible. Bill's a talented curse-breaker and Fleur was his apprentice for a time. I'm sure the two of them will have the situation handled soon.""

""I can ask Daddy to investigate the Azkaban riots, to double-check if anyone escaped that the Ministry isn't telling us,"" Luna offered.

""Thanks Luna,"" Harry accepted gratefully.

""So we're ignoring Trelawney's possible prophecy then?"" Ginny asked.

""We can try to take precautions but there's not much we can do with it to be honest,"" Hermione replied, ""The  muddled  could refer to a whole host of possibilities. It could be literal, it could be figurative--and muddled about what? And who knows what  desire  refers to within those contexts. Also 'Purity will always conquer ' isn't necessarily a bad thing either? It could be purity of heart, purity of soul, purity of mind...""

""Or it could refer to the Malfoy family motto,"" Ernie rebutted.

Hermione blinked, ""But Malfoy didn't even come back to school this year. No one knows where he is. Not sure how it could possibly be related.""

""Just saying. 'Purity will always conquer  ' or 'Sanctimonia Vincet Semper' is a rather specific phrase.""

The room was silent for a moment as they all made their own conclusions. Some of them were perfectly willing to blame the Malfoys even though Narcissa Malfoy had been instrumental to Harry's survival during the Final Battle.

Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. ""Let's shelve it for now. Hermione and I will try to catch up with Bill--er Professor Weasley and see if he at least confirmed whether McGonagall is under a curse or not. We'll each observe and take note if there's anyone else acting suspiciously. Then we'll regroup in the Room of Requirement this Saturday to pool our findings. Be careful. Stay vigilant. Stick together. OK, guys?""

""Yes Harry,"" they chorused.

They all filed out of the Head dormitory, leaving Harry and Hermione behind.

Hermione bumped shoulders with a despondent Harry. This time she took the initiative and pulled Harry into a hug. ""I thought we were past all of this,"" Harry whispered against her shoulder, ""Voldemort's dead dammit. We made sure didn't we?""

""I'm sure it's not him. This could just be a fanatic. Voldemort didn't come into power all on his own after all.""

Harry stayed silent and brooding. Hermione held him and sighed.

 

 

Harry and Hermione stayed in their rooms, trying uselessly to do some NEWTs self-study. Harry mostly kept his eye on the Marauder's Map, waiting until the cluster of professors finally dispersed from the Great Hall and back to their offices or suites.

He nudged a distracted Hermione and pointed at the map. ""I'm going to try to talk to Bill now. To see if he can tell us what happened."" Hermione scrambled to get up, but Harry placed a hand on her shoulder. ""I'm going alone. Professor McGonagall is still on the prowl and I don't want you crossing paths with her. Not when you could be her next victim.""

""But you're going to be with me--we shouldn't be alone, remember?"" she objected.

""I doubt that my presence is going to stop her from demanding you go with her alone,"" Harry explained grimly. ""She is still Headmistress. Curse or no curse.""

""What about the cloak then? Besides, there's nothing stopping her from coming into the dorm while you're gone. She knows the location and the password,"" Hermione argued.

Harry paused, ""Fine. But you have to leave the moment we spot McGonagall OK? I don't want you anywhere near her.""

""Promise. I'll bring the map with me under the cloak just in case. Keep your Protean coin on you. If it heats up with a message, it means she's nearby.""

""Alright.""

The two of them headed down, trekking toward Bill's office where the map said both Weasleys would be.

When they arrived, the door was closed and warded off. Harry knocked, ""Bill? Are you in there? Can we talk?""

No response. He knocked again louder. When Bill still didn't come to the door, Harry pressed his ear against the wood to try listening for him instead.

He could make out a low buzz of sound. Likely a  Muffliato  had been cast. Harry jumped when he realized he could still make out a wordless, high pitched scream. Fleur's scream.

Harry started to bang on the door, ""Fleur? Bill? Are you two OK in there?"" Panic infused his voice. Audible snarling and pounding could be heard whenever he pressed his ear against the door. More howls.

Hermione must have done the same. Harry watched her floating wand appear; Hermione cast a dozen spells at the door to no effect.

""I-I can't get the wards down Harry,"" Hermione whispered frantically. ""Whatever or whoever got to Trelawney and McGonagall must have gotten to them too.""

The two glanced helplessly at each other. Hermione made the decision to leave; She pulled Harry under the cloak with her and quickly dragged them both towards the Charms corridor. Hopefully, Professor Flitwick would be able to help.

Harry gave Hermione a look. ""Stay,"" he mouthed to her before leaving the safety of the cloak.

He knocked quickly on Flitwick's door. The wizard opened the door and greeted Harry with surprise, ""Harry Potter! What on earth brings you to my door at this hour? I know you're Head Boy, but the curfew is for your own safety.""

Harry immediately blurted out, ""Professor! Bill's in some kind of trouble! I was trying to speak with him about this thing I asked him yesterday, but his door was all warded and we--I mean I heard screaming, snarling, and loud banging. Fleur's in there too and--I couldn't get through the wards. What if whoever got Professor Trelawney got to them too?! We have to go back to check!"" Harry got more worked up as he spoke.

""Now wait just a minute. My colleagues and I have combed over poor Sybil and the Great Hall all day Mister Potter. The blood was hers and there were no signs of any other wizard or witch when she took her own life. I don't know what motivated her to make such a gruesome stage as her parting message, but there was no one else involved.""

Harry opened his mouth to argue, but the Charms Professor cut him off and continued, ""As for  Mister and Missus Weasley, perhaps there's a good reason as to why the door was warded? Did anyone else hear this... screaming? Loud noises? Or was there at least some kind of noise dampening charm cast?""

Harry flushed when he caught onto Flitwick's insinuations, ""W-well yes. I didn't hear it unless I was right next to the door--but Professor! Surely you can't believe there's nothing sinister afoot?! Professor Trelawney might have been a bit off her rocker, but she  has  had prophecies before! What if those words were true?""

""Then let the professors handle it,"" Flitwick advised, ""I know we've put a lot of expectations on your shoulders because of You-Know-Who, but we have it handled from here. When we know more, we'll inform you and the whole student body. For now, just head back to bed Mister Potter. Classes will resume in the morning."" The professor practically shoved Harry out the door.

Harry stood still for a few moments before an invisible hand tugged at his sleeve.

He took the hint and headed back with an invisible Hermione in tow. There wasn't much else they could do right now. Harry's face flushed again when he thought about what Bill and Fleur might have been up to in the office. He was sure if he could see Hermione's face, it would be a similar hue.

 

 

Except classes did not resume the next day. Not really.

That morning, Harry and Hermione waited in their Transfiguration classroom for Fleur to arrive, but she never showed. Harry checked the map behind his textbook and found her and Bill's names still somewhere in the latter's office. The two of them exchanged worried glances.

When the class period ended, the group of Gryffindor and Ravenclaw Seventh Years headed to Charms. There, they found the previous class of Fourth Years running out the door with petrified looks on their faces.

""Now that's not very nice children,"" Prof. Flitwick scolded from the door. The normally affable professor appeared completely different this morning. His previously coiffured hair and mustache were all awry and frizzled, almost like he had stuck his finger into an electric socket somehow.

A glimpse into the classroom showed it had been visited by a tornado overnight. Bits of parchment were scattered haphazardly all over. Desks and chairs were piled here and there, some broken, some fused together in illogical ways. Strange knickknacks floated here and there.

The mad Professor gestured excitedly at his next set of students loitering at the door, an untrustworthy gleam in his eye. ""Well? Come in youngsters, come in and see my latest work! Come  play!"" The part-goblin practically bounced off the walls in his delirium. Harry wrestled his way to the front and slammed the door closed.

It was obvious something was seriously wrong. Flitwick had gone mental overnight. Fleur and Bill were sequestered somewhere in their rooms and Harry doubted they intended to leave them any time soon. He took charge and ordered most of his classmates to go back to their dorms until further notice and to pass the message along to any student they came across. He and former DA members would take charge of investigating the professors.

Harry and Hermione sent off  Patronus  messages to retrieve their remaining Hufflepuff counterparts. It didn't take long for them to skid around the corner to join them. They had been waiting on Bill for DADA two corridors down.

Harry paired most of them off and assigned each pair places to check up on. ""If the professor shows any signs of being cursed, bar their doors with  Colloportus,  and ward the structure with  Utintus Diaboli .""

Hermione quickly helped demonstrate the two spells on Flitwick's door and showed them the wand movements several times afterward. Harry continued when everyone felt comfortable with the spells, ""Once you're done, come up to the Come-and-Go room to report.""

Ginny and Neville promised to check the Potions classroom to see what Slughorn was up to and then round up any students in the dungeons to escort them back to their dorms. Both had intimidating enough reputations that even the Slytherins would think twice before disobeying their orders.

Dean and Padma would make the trek to the greenhouses to check on Professor Sprout and deal with any students they came across. Harry also asked them to make a pit stop at Hagrid's hut on their way back. No one should be out there since there weren't any Care of Magical Creatures classes scheduled on Tuesdays. He hoped Hagrid had avoided getting caught up in all since he hadn't been in the Great Hall yesterday morning like the rest of the professors.

Seamus and Luna would head back to the DADA and Transfiguration classrooms just in case Bill or Fleur showed up. They promised to swing by the library afterward to clear out any students they encountered.

Justin and Michael would make their way to the infirmary and see if Madam Pomfrey was also infected. If so, they would have to subdue her and ensure any students in her care were not further harmed.

The rest of them would head to the Room of Requirement first and set-up there. As long as they were specific in their request, it should prevent the professors from entering. One of them would keep an eye on the map and send backup if needed. None of them were to engage with McGonagall, Flitwick, or the Weasleys if they could help it.

The troop dispersed with determined expressions on their faces.

 

 

The larger group arrived in the Room in short order. The door opened to reveal a miniaturized Great Hall that situated only a single long table instead of the usual four.

They set themselves up and started discussing what their next steps should be.

Susan brought up the question of who they could reach out to if all the professors were compromised.

They made a list of other Order members. Their choices were narrowed down to Kingsley Shacklebolt, Arthur and Molly Weasley, and maybe Aberforth Dumbledore. No one else was in a position to help them. They resolved to pen a separate letter to all of them just in case.

Hannah and Ernie volunteered to bring the letters to the Owlery to get them delivered.

A grumbling stomach also reminded them that the Great Hall had been closed for investigation, and they needed to make a request to the House Elves to feed everyone. Hannah and Ernie added a stop at the kitchens to their trip. They would see if the Elves could send food to the dorms. Hermione thanked them and wished them safe travels before the two headed off.

In the meantime, Hermione and Harry set about outlining what they knew about the situation and what their suspicions were, using a chalkboard that appeared on the wall. While they were doing that, Susan kept an eye on the map to track their friends' progress.

The Azkaban riots, McGonagall and the missing students/cats, the Weasley professors, Flitwick, Trelawney, and her full Prophecy all were all jotted down. A side note was added to the prophecy to point to the Malfoys' family motto. Harry's last addition was linking the McGonagall to the Ministry--that had been the most likely place the Headmistress had gotten cursed from.

They started a list of Azkaban prisoners and were disheartened by the length and how each seemed just as likely to be the perpetrator of their situation as another. Hermione was tempted to cross it off. The more she thought about it, the less likely whoever was behind this had snuck into Hogwarts. The curse was more likely replicating without the original castor. She scribbled down her argument next to the list.

Hermione put down Professor Snape's portrait on the side. The dour man must have seen something while he was in the Headmistress's office. He had been the only painting left on the wall during the tea fiasco. Looking back, Hermione realized not even Professor Dumbledore's portrait had remained hanging.

Following the train of thought, Hermione wondered if the other portraits or maybe ghosts might have seen something. She noted that down as well.

A question mark was placed for how the curse was spreading. Was it touch? Or proximity? Or did the cursed have to cast the specific curse to another? Was the cursed witch in control of her actions or was it more like an  Imperius ? Or was there an object they hadn't noticed that was the source of the curse? Or some combination of them all?

What was the purpose of the curse in the first place? There was no rhyme or reason for what they'd witnessed so far. McGonagall's obsession with cats, Trelawney's suicide, Fleur and Bill's seclusion, and Prof. Flitwick's 11-out-of-10 personality--none of them seemed connected.

But it was all they had at the moment.

Hermione and Harry sat next to each other to mull it all over.

 

 

Ginny and Neville made their way down to the dungeons, ordering anyone they came across to head back to their dorms. Classes were being canceled until further notice. They were under no circumstances to open the door to any professors. The frightened students did as they were told.

Professor Slughorn was thankfully in his classroom. Unfortunately, he too had fallen victim to the nameless curse. The Potions classroom had been glamoured to look more like a cartoonish Olympic temple, cloud-like fog included. The man in question was in a toga and stank as if he had dived into a vat of alcohol.

The inebriated wizard tried to get handsy with Ginny after he approached them with his greetings, but she hexed him reflexively with a stunner.

He made no effort to defend himself and was knocked out instantly. When Neville resuscitated him, Slughorn remained this strange drunken creature that babbled and got far too close for comfort. Ginny collected Sober-Up potion from the stores behind the transfigured classroom and poured it down his throat, but it had no effect.

The professor went on to ramble about people long gone, including Tom Riddle, Lucius Malfoy, Cornelius Fudge, and a host of other people they'd only ever heard of in the papers or in books. About how  his  students were going on to change the world and it was all thanks to him.

He peered up at Neville and hiccuped, ""I don't know you boy. Who are you again? Are you famous? Surely you know who  I am?""

Neville and Ginny left him be after that. At least he seemed innocuous enough. They cast the two charms on the door of the classroom to keep him inside and others out before making a sweep through the rest of the dungeons. When they were done, they trudged back up toward the seventh floor.

 

 

Dean and Padma cast worried glances at each other when they heard a young witch crying outside the greenhouses. They made their way over to the Second or Third Year Slytherin cautiously.

""What happened?"" Padma asked gently. The little blonde girl sniffled, ""Professor Sprout was really scary today.""

""Really? Professor Sprout is usually a sweetheart. Was it her plants? She does have some scary ones.""

Dark brown eyes watered, ""No. I love Professor Sprout and her plants aren't  usually  scary. But not today. Today that w-was some demon! Or a monster! She fed anyone who couldn't answer her questions to the  Nepenthes  . S-she... she said that if they didn't think Herbology was an important subject to study, they were better off as  f-f-fertilizer  . I couldn't... I couldn't even scream or do anything. It ate  everyone. "" The poor girl choked up on the last word.

Dean pulled the terrified kid into a hug, ""Hey, it's not your fault. There's nothing you could have done. Something must be wrong with Prof. Sprout. Go back to your dorms. We'll escort you after we lock the greenhouses so no one else can stumble onto the... the demon Professor Sprout OK?"" The girl clutched at his arm while nodding numbly.

Padma cautiously approached the greenhouse doors. She peeked inside the glass structure. The main greenhouse had always been extended as needed, but today the back looked like a forest filled with vibrant foliage, each leafy appendage casting ominous shadows over the entire space. She tried not to think about the whole class of students being digested in the belly of some carnivorous plant.

When Padma confirmed Prof. Sprout was still inside tending her plants, she quietly cast the necessary spells over the entrances and snuck back swiftly.

The three walked back in silence and were steps from reentering the school when Padma realized they hadn't checked in on Hagrid. They reluctantly double-back. Dean and Padma weren't sure if they should be relieved or not to find the half-giant was not home. The hut looked hastily abandoned. Fang was nowhere to be found and the cupboards were all opened and emptied. They closed and warded it behind them just in case before heading back to the castle.

 

 

Seamus and Luna had a comparatively uneventful trip from the Charms classroom back to the Transfiguration room. The next class was idling inside and two dozen eyes peered at them when they arrived, clearly expecting Professor Weasley to finally show up. Seamus clapped his hands and ordered them to go back to the dorms as the professors had canceled all classes again.

The group of Sixth Years wasn't fooled. ""Was... was it Professor Trelawney?"" One brave soul asked.

Luna smiled sadly, ""Sort of. There's something else going on with the professors. It'd be safer for everyone to be back at the dorms where you can take care of one another.""

Seamus continued, ""Avoid them if you can. Stay together. Help the younger years stay clear as well. Some of us Seventh Years are doing our best to handle the situation without the adults, but we can't do it while taking care of everyone else too. You Sixth Years aught to step up where you can. We're going to tell the portraits to change their passwords and to deny the professors' access. We don't know if that'll stop them but it's the best we can do for now.""

The mix of Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs straightened up immediately, prepared to do what was necessary. Most of them had experienced just how fast and ugly things could get.

""Come on, we need to lock the classroom so no one else accidentally comes in. We're heading to the DADA classroom to do the same and then we have to check the library. We'll escort you guys to your dorms afterward."" The combined group quickly made their way out of the classroom. Luna warded the door behind them.

When they reached the DADA classroom, no one was inside. Seamus threw up the spells and they all marched to the library.

A pair of Fourth Year students converged with them, ""Hey, we've been waiting in front of the library all morning but they never opened."" The two gave each other weird looks, ""We tried knocking but Madam Pince didn't answer.""

A snarl could be heard--Madam Pince--was clearly inside. ""Oh go away you vermin! This library is no longer open to your dirty paws. Oh, don't listen to them, my precious ones ... Not one more of my lovelies will leave this sanctuary. No, they won't,"" the crazy witch cooed.

Luna stepped back and simply cast the two spells they were told to set up. Seamus shook his head before gesturing to the waiting students to follow. They rounded up any stragglers as they all headed back to the dorms.

 

 

Justin and Michael stumbled across Filch's crumpled body on their way to the infirmary. The man was unnaturally still and his eyes half open and unseeing. A fresh bloodstain marred the section of the wall that his body was leaning against. Two Firsties clung to each other, eyes wide with terror and guilt.

Justin crouched down and checked for a pulse. He found a weak one. He ran his hand over Filch's eyes to close them, too repulsed to keep looking while they were open as they were.

""What happened here,"" Michael asked in the calmest voice he could muster.

""It was an accident!"" One of the boys exclaimed, tears falling freely on his cheeks.

The other boy--a twin they realized as the resemblance was uncanny--jumped in, ""Tony was just trying to m-make him stop. H-He didn't mean to throw him against the wall."" His mouth was all cut up and bloody spit flecked out while he was trying to explain. Justin wondered how he was even talking at this point. It was clear the boy needed medical attention.

Justin cast a healing spell on the poor kid--he had been working with Madam Pomfrey since the start of the year because he had aspirations to become a Healer in the future. He didn't know enough to handle head trauma, however. They'll need the Madam for that.

The kid sniffled in gratitude when the cuts around and in his mouth sealed up. A  Tergeo  took care of the remaining blood. Tony hugged his brother.

""What did the ornery bastard do to you? Did he hit you?"" Michael snarled. He had never liked Filch.

Tony picked up a rusty and bloody instrument off the floor and showed it to the two Seventh Years. ""He was shoving this into Derek's mouth. He kept calling him a liar and that he needed to be punished for it. He was trying to tell Filch he was going to the Hufflepuff dorms with me. I asked him to because I was scared.""

Derek, who was a First Year Ravenclaw, burst into tears again when he saw the monstrosity.

Both Justin and Michael recoiled from the medieval-like torture instrument--it was shaped a little like a sliced up pear with a handle attached at the top. The pear body was partially flowered open, its edges sharp and cruel. It was far too big to be fit in a kid's mouth and made it clear where the cuts had come from.

""Fucking Filch ,"" Michael cursed in his mind as he hastily grabbed the thing out of Tony's hand. He shrunk it and put it into his pocket for now until he had someone to report Filch's behavior to.

""It's OK. We know it was an accident. You're not in trouble,"" Justin soothed as best he could. ""We actually have to check on Madam Pomfrey now. We'll bring Filch along. She'll help. Come on."" The two boys tailed Justin and Michael closely as they headed up to the infirmary with the unconscious Filch floating behind them.

Fortunately, the infirmary was still open to visitors. Michael levitated Filch's body over to a bed while Justin called for the matron, ""Madam Pomfrey! Madam Pomfrey are you in here?!""

""Coming boys, stop that yapping. You'll wake up my other patients.""

The two boys sighed in relief. A little too soon as they would find out.

Madam Pomfrey  looked  the same. She bustled over and tsk-ed at the sight of Filch. ""Of course it'd be him. Horrible man. I'm surprised he hadn't been done in sooner.""

Justin and Michael look at each other, ""He's just unconscious ma'am. Was knocked into the wall by some accidental magic,"" Justin clarified.

The matron cast a silent spell and Filch's head was separated from his neck. The two eleven-year-olds screeched at the top of their lungs as blood splattered and drenched the bed. ""Now none of that. He was all but dead. I just made sure of it. Now let's take a look at you two...""

Both Justin and Michael threw a stunner at the Head Nurse before she could fully turn around. She collapsed instantly.

Swallowing down their own fear for the sake of their young charges, the two older boys took stock of the other beds and only spotted one that had the curtains drawn. Michael pulled the curtain aside and turned a little green when he was greeted with the sight of Prof. Trelawney's body.

They'd have to lock up the infirmary. Justin decided it would be best to raid the medicine cabinet and absconded with as many potions as he could shrink and fit into a transfigured crate. 

Michael pulled both Firsties out the door, clamping a hand over both of their mouths to shut them up. The four scurried out the door. Justin quickly cast the two spells to bind Pomfrey within the Infirmary.

The two drop the traumatized twins off at the Hufflepuff dorms--Derek declined a separate escort to the Ravenclaw tower--before making their way to the Room of Requirement.

 

 

Ernie and Hannah arrived at the Owlery without any issues. Unfortunately, they were presented with an empty roost. None of the school owls had returned. The two shared a worried glance. Without owls, they would have to get access to the Headmistress's fireplace to floo call for help. None of the other fireplaces had access with the lockdown in place. A dangerous endeavor when McGonagall was subject zero for whatever curse this was.

They headed off to the kitchens next. Thankfully, at least one of their two tasks were successful. They were greeted enthusiastically by a hundred House Elves who didn't know what to do with themselves after the Headmistress had told them to stop delivering food to the Hall and stay in the kitchens until further notice.

The two convinced the Head Elf that students were being sequestered in their dorms for their own safety and would appreciate getting their meals delivered there for the time being. The Elves jumped to do as they were told. Hannah also requested having enough for eleven to be sent to the Come-and-Go room. The two exited the kitchens in a better mood than they had entered with.

That was until they were greeted by the disapproving face of one Headmistress McGonagall. The two froze.

 

 

Susan cursed. Harry and Hermione's heads swerved towards her.

""Prof. McGonagall just caught Hannah and Ernie outside of the kitchens!"" As if on cue, their charmed galleons heated up.

""Dammit,"" Harry echoed. ""You two stay here. I'll see if I can help.""

""What?! You can't go alone Harry! What happened to sticking together?"" Hermione exclaimed.

""I'll go under the cloak Hermione. The point is not to be found. Hopefully, Ernie and Hannah already came up with a good enough excuse to get away from her. If not... I'll improvise. It'll be the three of us against her. We'll have the advantage.""

""Just be careful Harry.""

Harry gave her a smile full of false bravado before pulling the cloak over himself and dropping out of sight. The door creaked open and closed with a soft thud behind him.

Harry raced towards the kitchens. It was a long trek from the Seventh Floor to the basement.

His breath hitched when he found Prof. McGonagall hunched over two struggling felines. She immobilized them just as Harry got close enough to engage the insane Professor.

Wand already clutched in hand, Harry threw a  Stupefy, Immobulus,  and  Expelliarmus  at his Headmistress in quick succession.

The old matron avoided and deflected Harry's spells with nothing more than a twist of her body, a quick sidestep, and a flick of her wrist.

Harry grimaced. Either he had gotten rusty in the last few months or Prof. McGonagall was moving more quickly than her seventy-something body should ever be capable of.

""Looks like you're losing your touch Mister Potter. So much for the Savior of the Wizarding World,"" the witch taunted with a jeer. Harry jolted--how had she identified him so quickly?

""I never understood why Albus gave you that cloak. It was just asking for trouble. Not that it matters. I can hear your footsteps boy.""

""Why happened to you at the Ministry? Why are you doing this Professor?""

""Let's just say I was freed of burdens I didn't know I had. It's fine if you don't understand. You will soon enough.""

Harry and McGonagall engaged in a duel that felt like it lasted hours instead of a few short minutes. At first, Harry clung to his cloak even though it was somewhat cumbersome. It provided a small amount of protection against debris and any slicing hexes she sent his way. Harry could only be thankful that the hall limited the Transfiguration Mistress's ammunition with how bare it was.

Halfway through the duel, the Professor finally landed a  Ventus  that blew the cloak down the hall. Harry didn't dare get distracted and continued to engage his opponent with more powerful spells, giving up stealth and safety to land hits on the wiry old lady. Prof. McGonagall landed a number of hexes and charms on him in return.

In the end, Harry only nailed the Professor down because Ernie heroically threw his newly freed feline self to attack Prof. McGonagall's ankles. She stumbled and went down in a heap, caught directly in the chest by Harry's latest spell. 

By this point, Harry wasn't thinking clearly and had been throwing every spell he could remember, taking advantage of his superior reservoir of strength. He didn't care what he hit her with, only that he could disarm her afterward to ensure she couldn't attempt to attack him again.

He absentmindedly tucked the extra wand into his pocket before limping over to free Hannah who had yet to shake off the  Immobulus as Ernie had. He collected the two felines and his cloak before doubling back to levitate Prof. McGonagall into the Great Hall and warding her inside. Then he made the painful trek back to the Room of Requirement.

He registered the shock on the reassembled group's faces before he passed out.

 

 

When Harry came in collapsed with two cats in tow, Hermione's heart nearly stopped.

She quickly levitated his body and started casting every diagnostic spell she could think of while pleading to the Room to give them a bed for her to place him on. The Room obliged.

Hermione did her best to heal Harry's wounds and remove any lingering hexes or jinxes. Justin helped and advised Hermione to let Harry sleep until he woke up naturally just in case.

The rest of the DA had all arrived with news and Hermione wasn't looking forward to hearing it based on the dark expressions they sported to various degrees. At least they had food now. Hannah and Ernie must have accomplished their mission before being caught by McGonagall.

One by one, they summarized their experiences and concluded none of the adults in the castle were sound of mind anymore. That left the duty to the Head students, Harry and Hermione, and their handful of friends. Harry, Ernie, and Hannah were all down for the count so Hermione had to take lead.

""I'm going to stay here in the Room with Harry and... Hannah and Ernie, I suppose,"" Hermione said as she glanced down at the cats. ""This will be HQ until we figure out how to either leave Hogwarts or reverse the curse. Our last resort will be to sequester the entire student body here. The Room is still recovering from the Fiendfyre incident and I don't know if it will be able to accommodate all of us. Not to mention it'd be disastrous if one of the cursed gets inside.""

Neville piped up, ""Maybe we can ask if it'll make us a tunnel to Hogs' Head. It did last year.""

Everyone tried to concentrate on the request but the Room didn't respond. It seemed whatever lockdown protections they had crafted with the restoration extended to the Room.

Hermione rubbed her temples. She wished this was just a nightmare. One she could wake up from.

""I need you all to split off to each of the Houses and keep watch over them. Neville, Ginny, Dean please take Slytherin. Luna, Susan go to Ravenclaw. Seamus, Padma take Gryffindor, and Justin, Michael go to Hufflepuff. The goal is to make sure no one leaves the dorms and keep a watch on the entrance. Try to come up with some kind of lookout schedule so if a professor does try to get in, someone can warn the students to defend themselves.""

""But is it really safe to just leave you here with Harry? He might still be hurt,"" Ginny worried, ""Ernie and Hannah can't exactly help you in their current state.""

Hermione nibbled her lower lip in consideration, ""It'll be fine. Harry should wake up soon. Actually, Luna, take Hannah please. You and Susan have the best Transfiguration skills among us. See if you can reverse whatever Professor McGonagall did. I'll do the same with Ernie here while Harry's still down for the count.""

Luna picked up the feline as her response. She hissed a little when the feline swiped at her.

Hermione sighed and cast a healing spell at Luna's scratches, ""Be careful. We still don't know how this curse is spreading. Try to avoid touching them if you can. Use the galleons if you need help. I'll... We'll figure something out.""

Soon Hermione found herself alone with an unconscious Harry and a cat that was acting pretty much like a regular tom. Any semblance of human intellect was absent as the cat bathed his privates with his tongue.

Hermione settled herself on a chair next to the bed and dropped her throbbing head onto the mattress. ""Please wake up Harry. I can't do this without you.""

 

 

When Harry came back around, he was greeted by one hovering Hermione. The Room must have accommodated and given them a bed. It was sectioned off by curtains like in the infirmary.

""Harry! You're awake! Thank Merlin!"" Hermione exclaimed, clamoring onto the side of the bed to peer down at him.

Harry didn't respond, staring unseeingly at the ceiling. The world was fuzzy at the edges and his body still ached from his duel.

""Harry?"" Hermione tried again.

Harry blinked slowly. In a move too quick for the eye to discern, Harry found he had tugged Hermione on top of him and rolled the both of them over. Hermione let a belated shriek.

As Harry tried to catch his bearings, Hermione berated him for his manhandling, ""What--what do you think you're doing Harry?""

As if they were the magic words, the world sharpened and Harry was no longer dazed.

Harry smiled beatifically before answering, ""Taking what I want.""

Hermione gaped up at him and Harry's eyes immediately flicked down to her lips.

""W-what exactly--"" Her words were muffled when Harry took the opportunity to kiss her.

It was innocuous at first. A teasing kiss involving only the brush of his lips against hers. Harry pressed harder only when Hermione parted her lips slightly for him.

Then it was anything but innocent; he kissed her harder, more boldly as he tangled his tongue with hers.

She started to shove against him, words trying to escape her besieged lips. ""Wa-it H-Harry. This--this... isn't right.""

Harry frowned and finally leaned back. He pushed himself up and sat Indian-style on the bed, ""I love you, Hermione. How can this be anything but right?""

Hermione squawked as she scrambled to sit upright as well. Harry laughed at the strange sound and impeded her efforts by weaving his fingers between hers. She finally got up her legs under her, her hands still clutched in his.

""Harry! This isn't funny! You can't just--just--drop that on me!""

""You're the brightest witch of your age Hermione. Surely you've noticed how much I adore you. What with all those kisses on the cheek and the hugs--I thought you liked me too. Even Ginny said you had a crush on me. You can't convince me that you don't."" Harry's tone got almost childish in its insistence at the end.

Instead of answering, Hermione just cried out in pain, ""Let go!""

Harry frowned and realized his grip had gotten too strong. He let go of her right hand and clasped her left in both of his. He pressed a kiss of apology against her trembling palm. ""Sorry, Hermione. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just don't understand why we're not on the same page."" He pouted.

""We--you--"" Hermione spluttered, ""This is hardly the time! What happened with Prof. McGonagall?"" She tugged ineffectively at her still captured hand.

Harry's eyes narrowed, ""I don't  want  to talk about her.""

""But Harry--""

Fed up with waiting, Harry whipped out his wand to encourage things along, but Hermione flicked out hers just as quickly.

They made a strange sight. One hand holding a wand to the other's face; One hand intertwined with the other's in a lovers' clasp.

""Don't do this Harry.""

""I'm not doing anything Hermione. You're the one being stubborn--""

""Stupefy!"" 

""Incarcerous!"" 

Harry was too slow. The world went black again.

 

 

Hermione's heart thudded in her ears. She rotated her wrist and flicked it to remove the magical bindings before quickly scampering off the bed. She snatched Harry's wand as she went, tucking it away for safekeeping.

""Please not Harry, please not him, please..."" Hermione muttered frantically as she started to cast every counter-curse she could think of over his prone body. He had to have been cursed.

When she exhausted her extensive memory, Hermione cautiously enervated him back to awareness; her wand was still trained on him.

Harry's eyes flickered open, a gasp leaving him at the magical shock.

""Harry! How are you feeling?"" What she really wanted to ask though was whether he remembered the last ten minutes.

Harry smiled sheepishly and Hermione was only slightly relieved by the familiar sight, ""I've been better. A bit bruised up. Guessing you fixed up the cuts though, thanks. McGonagall definitely got me with a few slicing hexes. Er... I'm not quite sure why you're pointing your wand at me though. Is there something wrong?"" His head tilted slightly to the right while his eyes widened and peered up. It was Harry Potter's infamous puppy look. The one that Hermione was hopelessly weak to.

Her voice wavered but her wand did not, ""You woke up before a-and you were acting really weird. What happened with Prof. McGonagall? Did you see what she did to Ernie and Hannah?""

Harry flopped back onto the bed, hands tucked under his head. ""I was too late. I only saw her freezing the cats by the time I got down to the basement. We dueled,"" Harry's eyes seemed to darken at the memory, ""Whatever the curse did, it changed her. She moved way too fast for a witch her age. I only got a good shot at her because of Ernie. I locked her in the Great Hall afterward. But none of the spells she cast were unfamiliar. Mostly just slicing hexes and some blasting curses. She couldn't transfigure much thankfully. Not enough to work with in the hall.""

""You sure she didn't cast anything strange?""

""Positive. None of her nonverbal spells hit me. Just a few minor  Diffindos  and the tail end of a  Confringo  . Oh, and a  Confundo I think. But it must have been her last spell otherwise I wouldn't be here in one piece.""

Surely that would explain it. Harry must have just been confused. He was normally sweet and considerate--not whatever that had been.

Just in case, Hermione shot the  Confundus  counter-charm on Harry again. He just quirked an eyebrow and looked expectantly at her.

Hermione finally lowered her wand and got up to pace. ""Thank Merlin you made it back out alive then,"" she noted as she rubbed at her temples. The mild throbbing was back. ""The others returned but I split them up and sent them off to help monitor the four dorms. None of the other Professors are viable at this point. Hopefully, Hannah and Ernie got the letters off before they went to the kitchens. In the meantime, maybe we need to check if Slughorn has any Veritaserum in his stores. We could use it to interrogate Prof. McGonagall and see if she remembers who cursed her and with what... Maybe we can find another portrait of Snape while we're in the dungeons and see if he has any ideas too.""

Distracted by her thoughts, Hermione didn't notice Harry had McGonagall's wand twirling around his fingers the entire time. Not until his second  Incarcerous  spell hit her in the back. She cried out and teetered trying to find her balance. Her wand flew out of her loosened grasp and into his.

""Bloody hell Harry! What do you think you're doing? Let me go this instant!""

Harry got up and placed her wand carefully on top of the Marauder's Map.

""I told you. For once, I'm taking what I want. I tried to be nice about it, but I see you need the extra persuasion. That's fine. I can wait. It won't be long now. Then you'll see what I see. But first...""

Harry patted her down until he felt the outline of his own wand trapped behind the magical bindings. He slipped it free from her person. Afterward, he kissed her on the cheek as if Hermione had just handed it to him. Hermione was left speechless.

The Boy-Who-Lived whistled a merry tune as Hermione finally shrieked and flailed uselessly while he put her over his shoulder. Abnormally strong hands dug unforgivingly into her flesh as he manhandled her back onto the bed.

She could only watch aghast as Harry snapped Prof. McGonagall's wand in half and tossed the remnants into a fireplace that had appeared out of nowhere. The Room was shifting to accommodate Harry's desires.

The long table at the center of the room separated itself, the section with food retained on a smaller table that scooted farther away in the room. The benches disappeared and two chairs replaced them. The section with the Map, the Protean galleons, and her wand reformed as a console table that settled at the foot of the newly reformed four-poster bed. Their blackboard still remained on the far side of the room. The floor was now covered in carpet and the room shrank down to a standard size.

It looked reminiscent of their rooms in the Head dorm when it was done. The lights dimmed and shadows were cast all over the room as the newly added windows reflected the evening light.

A yowl was heard before it was cut off abruptly with a horrible squelch. Ernie the cat had been removed from the picture.

""Let me go Harry! Oh my god,  Ernie! ""

Eerie green eyes caught her panicking ones as he drew close enough for her to feel his breath brush her face. He mouthed his answer against her cheek, ""Never .""

 

 

Harry cuddled a screaming, writhing Hermione as he watched the shadows slowly make their way through her magical aura.

Her curses got more creative as the curse progressed. She bit down at his exposed collarbone and Harry let out a curse of his own. Yanking her hair back so her head was tilted up and away from his skin, Harry watched as her fear waned and fury filled her eyes. He smiled.

""Just let me know when, love.""

""Fuck you Harry.""

""Gladly, but only when I'm not in danger of losing my manhood.""

She hissed at him, her eyes flashing in warning, ""Release me and you won't have to worry about it.""

""Hmm, a few minutes more than.""

Several long moments later, Hermione finally relaxed against his hold. She jutted out her lip, ""Harry this is uncomfortable. Can you  please  remove the bindings?""

""Is that what you really want?""

""No, what I really want is to snog you. But I'd much prefer having my hands while doing so.""

""Your wish is my command."" The bindings disappeared.

This time it was Hermione that pushed Harry down, ""We really shouldn't be doing this.""

Harry tugged at a cascading curl, ""Who's there to stop us?"" He pulled her down for a kiss.

 

 

That first night passed with little incident.

The newly awakened Hermione wasn't too different from what Harry imagined. She was more openly affectionate, quicker to anger. Uninhibited in her voracity to explore new ideas--ones that she confessed to Harry as things she never thought would see the light of day.

But Harry reassured her. All he wanted was to be with her. If she wanted to carve her name onto his skin, he didn't care as long as he didn't bleed out.

Hermione graced him with a wicked smile.

The days and nights passed in a blur.

Their glowing Protean coins were clucked to a corner and forgotten. Harry was done being the Saviour. The others could go save themselves this time.

Or not. He found himself not caring either way.

 

 

By the time Harry and Hermione finally deigned to leave the Room of Requirement, the curse had fully spread throughout the school. Every student from the most cautious Seventh Year to the most innocent First Year had been overcome. Either that or they were dead. Usually both.

It started with Luna. Hannah's scratch was all it took for the curse to take root.

She woke up the next morning talking about Nargles--which was the norm to any of the Ravenclaws who had grown up with her. They weren't even phased when Luna insisted anyone who couldn't see Nargles needed to have their eyes checked.

That's why all of them were caught off-guard when she smiled coquettishly and cast  Avada Kedavra  in quick succession at everyone who was present in the room. She skipped up and down the steps of the dormitory to murder the rest of her fellow Housemates. Only Susan was spared. Luna had left the Hufflepuff to sleep with a  Silencio  cast upon the room before heading out. Hannah the cat watched both witches in relative disinterest.

By lunchtime, all of the Ravenclaws were dead and their eyes reappropriated for in-depth study by one Luna Lovegood. Sixty-four pairs of eyeballs were stuffed into three huge glass jars filled with what could only be a preservation solution.

When Susan woke up to mutilated corpses littered all around her, she raced downstairs with an endless scream caught in her throat.

Luna happily greeted her friend, extolling her grand plans of making a hat out of her new collection. Susan fainted when she was confronted with the in-progress monstrosity.

When she noticed she had lost her audience, Luna awakened her with a  Rennervate.  Susan dry heaved and could only listen numbly as Luna waxed poetic about how she was going to leave Susan's eyes for last. ""You're my friend so I don't want to touch yours until I get these working you see. Once I confirm they can see Nargles for themselves, then I can properly dedicate my time to making something special for yours. I'm thinking of a pretty set of glass frames. What do you think?""

Susan fumbled to get her wand out of her holster but once she had it in hand, she cast a stunner with no remorse. Too distraught by the latest development, she forgot to take Luna's wand nor ward the door.

Though in hindsight, it wouldn't have helped. Not when there were sixty-four other wands scattered throughout the dorm for Luna to use.

Susan sent an SOS on her Protean galleon as she ran back to the safety of the Hufflepuff dorms, unaware of the taint in her aura. Tucked into her own bed, Susan went back to sleep thinking she was safe.

 

 

When the sun was high in the sky, a new Susan woke up. Michael and Justin came up to ask if she was OK and Susan cast  Imperius  on both boys. She forced them to round up all of the Hufflepuffs for her.

While they went to do her bidding, she worked on transfiguring a replica Wizengamot hat. When she got it shaped to match something she had seen her Aunt Amelia wear, she donned it proudly over her head and slipped on a set of black robes. Susan looked at the mirror and smiled at herself before heading over to the Common Room.

The assembled group of confused Hufflepuffs look at them for guidance. Susan tilted her head haughtily and her boys called for everyone to bring out their wands. Susan's pleased when the little ones do it immediately. The older ones, the ones who looked warily at the strangely behaving trio, took them out as well but in tight grips.

Susan dropped her facade and crackled, ""Court is in session now boys and girls. And I'm going to be judge, jury, and executioner!""

With a sweep of her wand, Susan sent out a powerful  Expelliarmus  that wrenched most of their wands out of their hands and sent them flying every which way. A few of the Sixth and Seventh Years manage to resist and send out hexes and curses in their defense. Justin and Michael's bodies jerked themselves in front of Susan to block them.

Justin was dead by the end of the first barrage, caught by four stunners and a blasting curse that tore open a hole through his lower torso. His left leg went flying off.

The screaming started.

Michael was only in slightly better shape, but he managed to break out of the  Imperius. Caught in the grip of the same curse, he turned around and got the jump on Susan. With an impossible surge of strength, he wrenched her wand from her grip, eliciting a furious shriek.

He threw the wand aside and got one hand around her throat to  squeeze. With the other, Michael unshrunk the pear of anguish he had confiscated yesterday, and shoved it down Susan's throat. He shifted his hold to force her mouth close and cranked the torture instrument further open until Susan finally stopped clawing at him. The Hufflepuffs watched on in horror as she choked on her own blood.

For a moment, the room was eerily quiet aside from Michael panting. Then he collapsed like a rag doll, finally succumbing to the boiling curse he had been hit with earlier.

The remaining Hufflepuffs stampeded out of the dorms in search of help. Most of them didn't make it very far.

Luna stopped by after collecting a few more eyeballs from students idiotic enough to leave the safety of their dorms. When she stumbled upon the dead bodies of her former friends, she merely frowned in consideration before shrugging to herself. She plucked all six eyes and placed them into a glittery bag. She waved her wand to preserve them before skipping off. Perched on her head was a grotesque hat with sixty-four pairs of reanimated eyes.

 

 

The next to fall was the Gryffindor Tower. All it took was one set of scared First Year twins to get Padma to lower her guard and let them into the Common Room.

The twins turned into devils that night and nearly a quarter of the students were slaughtered before Padma and Seamus had the heart to put the Firsties down. Stunners and other impediment spells just had no effect on the little terrors. The two Seventh Years tried sending messages on their charmed coins but when no response came, they rounded up the remaining Gryffindors and brought them all to the Room of Requirement.

They were first stupefied and then terrified when the door would not appear for them. They could only assume the curse had gotten Harry and Hermione as well. The Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of her Age were no longer there to save the day and it scared the crap out of them.

Seamus and Padma knew they had to take matters into their own hands and headed to the Headmistress's Office. They hoped to use the floo network there to get the rest of them off to safety. If they came across the witch in question, they swore to put her down before she could do any harm to the rest of them.

Luckily Prof. McGonagall was sentimental and had kept Prof. Dumbledore's tradition of using candy names as the password. It took several minutes of them all shouting different brands before the stairwell was revealed.

To their relief, the Headmistress was not in her office. Their hopes were still dashed however when they found the floo non-functional. It wasn't an issue on their side, but rather the network itself.

That wasn't the worst of it though.

The Gryffindors found themselves screaming as six very hungry and very angry cats launched themselves from the walls to attack them. A number of missed freezing charms and stunners were cast before the felines were subdued. Most of them sported scratches or bites by the end.

Seamus wracked his brain and came up with their next idea. The ragtag Gryffindors were going to make their way to the Quidditch pitch and take the brooms. With luck, they'll be able to find a weak spot to fly out of the grounds. And if not, they could try sending SOS flares into the sky while staying out of reach from the infected.

Padma was distracted by one of the cats who had scratched her and then licked the wound. She swore it must be Parvati and opted to stay behind. Seamus tried desperately to persuade her otherwise, but she wouldn't budge. Her twin needed her here and she just wasn't good enough to both carry a cat and fly a broom. Seamus offered to hold her instead, but Padma didn't want to risk it. If she was going to die, she wanted to die with her sister.

Seamus parted ways with her reluctantly. Padma wished them luck. Seamus looked hopeless when he did the same.

Padma wouldn't find out that the group never made it to the Pitch until much later--the newly infected wizards and witches turned on each other soon after. But by then, Padma didn't particularly care. She was far too busy exacting her revenge on Prof. McGonagall's corpse.

 

 

As for Ginny, Neville, and Dean, they had found out the hard way that Slughorn must have had a direct path from the Potions classroom to the Slytherin dormitory that they didn't account for.

The professor had already left his mark by the time the trio got there. They were met by a host of hostile Slytherins.

Dean was unfortunate enough to enter the snake's den first and was immediately greeted with an  Avada Kedavra for his troubles.

Ginny and Neville immediately went on defense. They slowly force their way into the dorms driven partially by the need to avenge their friend's death and partially because they couldn't risk letting the Slytherins run free of their dorms.

Ginny was next to get caught by a spell--just a  Petrificus Totalus  thankfully. Neville quickly freed her but the damage had already been done.

At first, Neville was more than glad to see the tides turn as Ginny turned into a fury incarnate against their dwindling assailants. He figuratively bit his tongue when his girlfriend started using darker curses. However, he wasn't in a position to do anything about it while dueling both Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, the only Seventh Year Slytherins to return this year.

He blacked out when a stunner finally took him down. The last thing he remembered was a livid Ginny casting  Avada Kedavra at Zabini.

When he woke back up, he wholeheartedly ignored the dead bodies scattered around him. His head was being pillowed by Ginny's thighs and he was perfectly content to follow his Mistress wherever she chose to lead him.

Ginny smiled wickedly and snogged Neville voraciously. She led him towards the girls' dorms, flicking her wand non-verbally while her arms were still looping behind his neck in order to move the bodies and furniture out of the way. She shoved him down carelessly onto the nearest bed, right next to a long-dead Professor Slughorn.

 

 

It was to be a quiet Christmas that year.

The Great Hall was mostly empty, its occupants consisting of only a few survivors who were too preoccupied to finish each other off. Christmas decorations were hung up courtesy to the still hardworking House Elves. A single towering pine tree stood tall at the front of the room.

Harry and Hermione sat as per usual at the Gryffindor table. Hermione was perched contentedly on her lover's lap. The witch was giving Harry happy kisses for the early Christmas present he had gotten her.

Luna was chattering away to herself next to a carefully arranged accessory collection at the Ravenclaw table. Eyeballs spun randomly on each piece, staring into the unknown. Luna petted them gently before skipping over to the Gryffindor table to join Hermione in admiring Harry's present.

Padma remained sequestered at the Ravenclaw table as far from Luna's grotesque creations as she could get. She had Parvati in her arms, scarred hands stroking the cat's well-preserved fur. Wrapped around her neck was a choker made of Prof. McGonagall's old skin. ""Spoils of war "", the witch would remind her feline sister whenever the undead cat's fur brushed against it.

Ginny and Neville arrived late and settled onto the Gryffindor table. The former had the latter collared and chained. Following behind them was the ghost of one Dean Thomas. The newest edition to the Hogwarts ghosts chattered amicably away to Neville who only glazed in quiet reverence at Ginny.

None of the other ghosts dared to make a similar appearance. Not after what Hermione did to Peeves after the poltergeist had the gall to make fun of her new relationship with Harry.

Bill and Fleur had finally deigned to come out as well and claimed the former Slytherin table. The former curse-breaker was a frightful half-wolf, half-man freak show. A botched attempt at self-transfiguration, Hermione observed. It didn't seem to stop the newly feathered Fleur from cuddling with him anyway.

Hermione told Harry that she was still debating on the best way to kill Bill. The self-induced 'werewolf' could only snarl in her direction. If it weren't for Harry and Fleur pulling them to the farthest parts of the room, they probably would have dueled to the death right there and then.

None of the other Professors had made it.

Trelawney had been slain by her own hand--or by McGonagall's. They weren't actually sure about that. Only that McGonagall had died at Padma's.

Slughorn was eliminated by an unknown Slytherin. Ginny suspected Daphne Greengrass but the other girl wasn't around to confirm it, having been sliced in half by an angry Ginny during the fight in the Slytherin dormitory.

Flitwick had likely blown himself up soon after Harry and co. locked him inside his classroom. The entire room was covered in rotting flesh, bits of bone, and dried blood.

At some point, Neville checked on the greenhouses and wasn't pleased by the sight of Professor Sprout's haphazard pruning. She had been nibbling on the plants in lieu of food and Neville didn't appreciate it. So Ginny fed the demented witch to one of the carnivorous plants for him. He played there with Dean when Ginny was too bored to entertain him.

Hermione blasted her way into the library and eviscerated Madam Pince into dust for daring to lay claim to her library. Harry helped her setup blood wards to claim the space properly. It was the first time Hermione got to play around with sacrificial magic so she was a happy camper at the end of it.

Madam Pomfrey died from thirst, starvation, and self-mutilation as no one remembered to check on her for a whole month. Not that the witch had cared enough to call for a House Elf either. When Hermione finally recalled the Mediwitch, she only found the dead matron and a Frankenstein pet project made up of Filch, Prof. Trelawney, and Madam Pomfrey's own body parts. She burned the dead bodies down with  Fiendfrye just in case the grotesque golem was reanimated before Pomfrey's death.

And so the survivors maintained their current status quo. The lockdown had kept the riff-raff out while leaving them with just enough room to keep out of each other's hair.

Harry had even found an exit out--not that he would tell anyone. He didn't want any interruptions with his new, peaceful life.

 

 

It was late November when Harry found Hagrid's body lying in the Forbidden Forest during one of his morning broom flights. The half-giant had been mauled by Acromantulas based on the wreckage. He wondered in a detached manner why the spiders hadn't just eaten him. 

Perhaps the spiders had recoiled at the writhing shadows of his magical aura. Perhaps they were smart enough to stay away.

Harry followed his fallen friend's steps and idly decided he would hold a grudge against the magical spiders in Hagrid's honor. It was a good excuse to stretch his magical muscles as no one back in the Castle would duel him anymore. Bill had lost a hand when he tried. Neville was nearly cut in half and Ginny took Harry's left ear in retaliation. Hermione took one look at him and tsk -ed. She didn't bother to avenge him. His personal harpy thought he deserved it for not finishing off Bill earlier when he had the chance. Harry was just lucky enough that Hermione liked his ears enough to regrow it back for him.

But he was digressing.

It was during his extermination efforts that he stumbled across a weak point in Hogwarts' defensive barrier. He found Fang's corpse next to it and he could only assume Hagrid had attempted to leave this way.

It didn't take much for the suped-up Harry to force his way through.

He closed the hole with a blood ward. Now only he could enter and exit this way.

A sharp crack cut through the air as Harry apparated into a deserted Hogsmeade. Not a single soul was in sight, just pecked, rotting corpses. He picked up a copy of the Quibbler where the only headline was 'The Ministry Has Fallen!'  sprayed across it.

Below were accounts of witches and wizards who openly attacked muggles, breaking the Statute of Secrecy without Ministry reprisal. Stories of muggles retaliating with witch-hunting also made the top half of the paper. The organized muggles easily overpowered the few witches and wizards who dared to show themselves. There were mentions of other Ministries putting up blockades against all visitors in a tiny article on the bottom left.

Harry unfolded the paper and found only a single bolded statement on the bottom half. It was a parting note from Luna's dad asking if anyone knew of a way to reanimate the dead to drop a note at the Quibbler's HQ.

The paper was dated November 13th, a little over a month ago.

Harry shook his head and chucked the paper back onto the stand. Oh well, it wasn't his problem. He had done his job defeating the Dark Lord. Now he was going to spend the rest of his life doing only what he wanted.

He whistled cheerfully as he openly grabbed wrapped chocolates and valuable sugar quills from an abandoned Honeydukes before heading back to Hogwarts. He could already imagine the sparkle in Hermione's eyes when he presented her with his spoils. 

He was sure he could trick her into thinking he had nicked it from some forgotten student's stash.

 

 

The next time he left the castle, it was at Luna's request. Harry had no idea how she knew he had a way out of the castle, but it was her birthday and she wanted to send a letter to her father. If he was still alive.

In return, she would not speak a word of it to Hermione.

And so Harry found himself on Xenophilius Lovegood's doorstep talking to a corpse. Luna's mother was nothing more than bones with false flesh grafted to her, but she was kind and invited Harry into her home. Luna's father was happy to hear his dear Luna was still alive and asked Harry to bring around her corpse should that change.

Curious, Harry asked for the method in which he had brought back his wife. 

Xenophilius was only too happy to share.

Along with a little tidbit to tickle Harry's fancy. He had looked into the Azkaban riot at Luna's request. Only a single Auror made it back to the Ministry to report the riot.

But Xenophilius made a personal trip to the prison and found it empty. All of the occupants were dead and so were many of the assigned Aurors including Ron. Xenophilius went to double-check each body against the list of prisoners and noted the missing body of one Lucius Malfoy. He didn't print it in the Quibbler though and the letter he sent to Luna never arrived at Hogwarts.

Harry narrowed his eyes in consideration.

 

 

The third time Harry left the castle was to retrieve Hermione's Christmas present. He spent two days trampling through France, cursing all the way. He didn't like being so far away from his beloved, but his prey had hidden rather cleverly within the continent.

Not that it would be enough to keep a determined Harry away.

Blood flowed after Harry forced the reanimated corpse of Abraxas Malfoy to open up the wards that separated him from his quarry.

 

 

Back at Hogwarts, Harry smiled besottedly at Hermione. The witch had forgiven his omission about finding a way out of the castle after he hung his specially prepared ornaments on the Great Hall's Christmas tree.

He had gotten the idea when the silly witch started fretting about Trelawney's last prophecy again. Harry took a second look at the blackboard that was still up at the far wall of the Come-and-Go room. The green-eyed wizard decided to interpret it the way he wanted to and went about making sure it was properly 'fulfilled'.

He had popped back to 12 Grimmauld Place to browse the selection before embarking on his illicit tour of the French countryside. After snapping his victims' wands right in front of them, Harry performed a Black family special to bind their magic before the curse could mutate it into something stronger. 

It was their fault for interbreeding so much. Even Lucius had a close enough Black ancestry to be subject to the ancient family magic.

The strung up Malfoys made a fetching picture among the sparkly ornaments. The petrified trio was tussled up in Christmas red and green robes for the occasion. Their mouths were sewn neatly shut with cheerful silver and gold tinsel, and their hands and feet bound in strings of muggle Christmas lights.

He had dragged them back as such: charmed with a feather-light charm and hanging haphazardly from his broom.

Horrified eyes were spelled wide open though they still roved around in their sockets. Harry had decided they'd be better off as live test subjects for his inquisitive lover and had refrained from blooding them up too badly.

Harry nuzzled Hermione's temple in contentment.

Hermione flicked her finger causing Draco to shake uncontrollably. The lights wrapped around his limbs flickered to life. ""Did I mention that I love you yet?"" she said.

""Yes, but I do so love hearing it.""

All's well that ends well as far as Harry was concerned."

Usually he had to get Draco a giant mug of tea and pepper his face with kisses before he even considered opening one eye. The other thing he was confused by was the foreign scent that seemed to fill the room. He found the scent's origin just a few seconds later when he rolled around to get out of bed and find Draco and saw a mug of tea as well as a bouquet made of several different flowers, one of which he could identify as roses.

""I love you,"" he whispered into the empty room, his heart suddenly feeling quite full.

 


Earlier


Draco groaned when his wand didn't stop vibrating even after he had tried to ignore it for five minutes already. ""Shut up, I'm up already,"" he grumbled under his breath, not wanting to risk waking Harry under any circumstances, and slowly rolled out of bed.

After a short but sufficient shower Draco got dressed and then went downstairs to at least attempt to make breakfast. There was no chance in hell that he would touch the stove or the oven for anything, but he had gotten a handful of breakfast recipes from Ginny that didn't require cooking and he wanted to try his hand at one or maybe two of them. He had already bought the ingredients for all of them ahead of time so now he would only have to put them together as well as he could.

He had just buttered the first slice of bread when he heard the Floo activate in the living room and then a few seconds later Ginny's greeting that sounded much too chipper for this time of day.

""Can I help you with anything, lover boy?"" she asked as she stepped into the kitchen.

""Get your good mood out of here,"" Draco suggested grumpily. He really wasn't a morning person, especially not if morning meant six am. ""I'm still half-asleep.""

""Why didn't you make yourself one of those giants mugs of tea before you started making breakfast?"" Ginny asked him and then got busy making said tea.

""Didn't you hear me? I'm still half-asleep. I can't think properly, yet,"" Draco said but couldn't summon the energy to roll his eyes.

""Poor baby,"" Ginny said, not sounding sympathetic in the least. ""That's why I am here now. I'll do the thinking, at least until you have some tea inside you.""

""Thanks so much,"" Draco said, not sure whether he meant it.

 

Ten minutes later and with a few sips of tea in his body, Draco slowly started to wake up properly and could admit that yes, he definitely should have made himself tea before even thinking of making breakfast. Sometimes the tendency of his brain to shut down every rational thought in favour of thinking about or doing something for Harry could be very hindering.

""Thank you, Ginny,"" he said after another sip of tea and this time he definitely meant it.

""No problem, Ray. That's what I'm here for."" Draco frowned at the pet name but in truth he had already made his peace with it a while ago because at least she wasn't calling him Dray anymore. ""And now give me that slice of bread and instead prepare something that actually needs to be prepared. Harry can butter his own bread.""

Draco did as she asked and started to prepare vegetables as well as a yoghurt sauce from one of Ginny's recipes to dip them into.

Half an hour later most of the breakfast was made and arranged on the table so Ginny left again after kissing Draco's cheek and wishing him good luck.

""You have amazing friends, Harry,"" Draco whispered into the now empty kitchen and then got to work making Harry tea and putting it in his favourite mug. He placed a stasis charm on the mug just in case Harry slept in longer than he usually did and then took both the mug and the bouquet of flowers he had bought yesterday and went to their bedroom to place them on Harry's nightstand.

 

Draco had just convinced himself to just go back to bed and sleep some more when arms snaked around his waist, startling him.

""I love you,"" Harry, who usually couldn't move silently to save his life, whispered.

""I love you, too, you big sap,"" Draco said even though he was surely just as big of a sap for making breakfast for Harry on his birthday when he usually avoided the kitchen like the plague. ""And happy birthday.""

""Thank you. Do I get a birthday kiss? Cause... you know... I'm your sap.""

Draco slowly turned in Harry's arms, careful not to make him spill his tea that he was still holding in one hand. ""Yes,"" he said, wrapped his hands around the back of Harry's neck and leaned down to kiss him but stopped before his lips could meet Harry's and added, ""Of course you are my sap. I wouldn't want it any other way."" Before Harry could call him a sap in turn he closed the gap between their lips and gave Harry a passionate birthday kiss.

Harry started smiling halfway through their kiss and was still smiling when he pulled out of the kiss again. ""I feel like this might become my favourite birthday to date.""

""Well, I certainly tried to make it so,"" Draco said and gave Harry another quick peck. ""I hope you're hungry because Ginny and I made a lot of breakfast.""

Harry yawned. ""I am. Thank you for making breakfast but I have to say, I'm a little surprised the oven is still perfectly intact.""

""That's because neither Ginny nor I touched it,"" Draco said, a little proud of himself for managing to put together a whole meal (with Ginny's help but still) without breaking anything in Harry's beloved Muggle kitchen.

""Well, that's one way to go about it,"" Harry said. ""Let's see how it tastes then."""

""Sweetie, Mummy's hair is not for pulling.""""He seems to love touching your hair as much I do, love.""""I'm glad you're gentler.""Lily and James Potter both laughed while they tried to get their six month old baby son, Harry, to stop pulling Lily's hair with his little hands. The green eyes of the little boy beamed at his parents, and he showed his sweet smile.James took Harry in his arms and sat on the living room couch, close to the fireplace. A warm fire was heating the room. That January had seen very cold and wet winter weather.Lily grabbed a comb and started to softly comb Harry's hair.""It's amazing how similar his hair is to yours. It's just so messy for a baby boy!""James chuckled. ""It might mean a tendency to be a bit rebellious... My mother always said that about my hair being so messy. We'll have a lot of fun when he grows up.""Lily put the comb down on the coffee table and kissed Harry's cheek. ""His hair is magical. It grows so fast. Ready to get some sleep, my little wizard?""Some minutes later, Harry was sleeping deeply in Lily's arms. As she sat on the couch, James fell asleep with his head against her shoulder. She felt so warm from the sensation of having her favorites blokes so close to her and so in peace. A happy feeling filled the Potters' house, even during such hard times.Lily took a deep breath and softly touched James's leg. He started, and then he helped her take Harry upstairs.It was time for another peaceful night's sleep.Fin"

He occasionally glanced out the window, watching the leaves fall.

It would have been just another year being there at Hogwarts, another year being professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, another year of teaching alongside his beautiful wife. But this year was different. This was their son's first year at Hogwarts, and the house he was sorted into alone made him worry.

Bae had been doing incredibly well in all of his classes so far. He was quick to make friends, and the teachers all spoke highly of him. He enjoyed the extracurricular activities and was even asked to become a chaser for the Quidditch team, which was an especially proud moment for everyone. There wasn't a single thing that should've worried his father.

He finally approached one of the windows, opening it wide and letting the cold air whip across his face. He knew all of the worrying was unnecessary. He was well aware of how blessed they were to have a son with such a good heart. He had to remind himself that their son would accomplish anything he put his mind to.

""It's freezing in here!""

Rumple smiled as Belle entered the office, flicking her wand to close the window and another flick to light the fireplace.

""My apologies, darling. I was attempting to clear my head,"" he replied, gently taking her hand in his. ""How were the students today?""

""I was a bit disappointed today. Quite a few of them did not study for the test today. If there's one thing all students should learn in order to understand magic, it's history,"" she sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. ""So, why were you needing to clear your head? Are you worrying about Bae again?""

""Perhaps,"" he murmured, leading her towards the warm fire.

""Rumple,"" she started, leaning against the fireplace, ""you know, as well as I do, that Bae has been doing incredibly well for his first year, more than we could've hoped. I doubt the house he was sorted into will make much of a difference. He's still the same sweet, kind-hearted boy he's always been.""

""I suppose I just expected that he'd be sorted into one of our houses.""

Belle laughed softly, wrapping her arms around him. She knew how much he worried about their son's future, what kind of person he would grow to be.

""He may not be a Gryffindor like his father or a Ravenclaw like his mother, but I know he will make his house proud. Hufflepuff prides itself on many things, including patience and loyalty. It is a noble and honorable house to be in,"" she explained, giving him a firm squeeze. ""Deep down, you know he'll excel no matter what.""

Rumple sighed contentedly. He knew she was right. Hufflepuff or not, Bae would exceed any expectations anyone had for him. ""I know, I know. I worry far too much about him than I should,"" he replied, chuckling lightly. ""I mean, he didn't even blink the first time he was hit by a bludger. He's far tougher than I ever was at his age. I never had the stomach for Quidditch.""

""Did the bludgers scare you, Rumple?"" Belle giggled.

Rumple narrowed his eyes at her, giving a wide grin.

""I was not fond of the idea of being hit by one, no. Nor did I care for the idea of being bashed by the bat of a beater, slammed around by other players, knocked off of my broom, or possibly hit in the head by a quaffle,"" he said facetiously, rolling his eyes at her. ""And in comes our boy on his first day of flying lessons and is asked to try out for the team, which he had absolutely no trepidation about. Unlike our boy, I wasn't much of a thrillseeker.""

""I knew you weren't, Rumple. Which is why, instead of gallivanting off on adventures like most boys, you came into the library that day and noticed a certain Ravenclaw girl studying for her exams,"" she teased, brushing her hand against his face. ""And if I recall correctly, you were quite adamant on taking me for a picnic lunch by the lake.""

""I was indeed. It was the most romantic outing I could come up with at the age of eleven,"" he huffed playfully, pressing his hand against hers. ""And I certainly didn't know then that it would be the start of my future. Now I have a family, a happy family at that.""

""Are you two gushing over each other again?""

They both turned to see Bae strolling into the office, a mischievous grin on his face.

""Very funny, Bae,"" Belle laughed, hooking an arm around Bae's neck. ""Done with classes for the day, I take it?"" ""All classes finished, assignments from yesterday turned in on time, and I even managed to finish today's homework early. I need to have everything done, so as to concentrate better for the match today. You both are going to be there, right?"" he said excitedly.

""We wouldn't miss your match for the world. Who's the competition today?"" Rumple asked. ""Gryffindor. Sorry, Dad. I have to show your house who the real champion is,"" he taunted, grinning as widely as he possibly could.

""You better watch that cheek, boy. I may not have played Quidditch, but I could've won in a duel with you when I was your age. Of course, your mum could've kicked both our arses,"" Rumple joked, ruffling the boy's hair.

""Well come on then. Let's see who loses first!"" Bae exclaimed, running out of the office eagerly.

""Honestly,"" Rumple began, turning back towards Belle, ""that boy is just like you were at that age.""

""How do you mean?"" she questioned, quirking a brow.

""He's nearly fearless, as you were and have always been. He'll take on a challenge headfirst and be steadfast, no matter the odds. He's quick to help others, especially when they need it most. He also refuses to back down when everything is stacked against him. The mix of bravery, devotion, and stubbornness most certainly comes from you, darling,"" he explained, kissing her forehead. ""And I'm forever grateful for it.""

Belle held him tightly.

""Don't you dare forget, Rumple,"" she stated clearly, ""our son is every bit like his father. He's clever and quick-witted, has a solution to any problem that arises. He has an unfathomable amount of snark, which most certainly comes from you. He's also bound to fall in love soon, if he's as much of a romantic as his father.""

""I love you, Belle,"" he whispered.

""And I love you, Rumple,"" she replied, kissing him deeply.

""Would you two stop kissing and hurry up? The match starts in a half hour!"" Bae groaned as he ran back into the office.

""We'll continue this discussion later,"" Rumple murmured, giving Belle a wink.

""Of course, dear,"" she replied, giving him a quick kiss.

""Alright, you brazen youngster, let's go see which of us loses with more dignity."""

One moment I was watching Dumbledore disappear into the swirling white mist, and the next I'm back in my body. Hair is sprawled across my face, and my limps are limp and bent at awkward angles from the force of the killing curse that had slammed into my chest. Everything throbs. I can feel my wand digging into my side, and my father's invisibility cloak pressing against my stomach. The earth beneath me is cool and slightly damp against my cheek. 

Forcing my body to remain loose, I strained my ears for any sound of Voldemort or his followers. Time passed slowly as I lay there waiting for something to happen, for them to learn I was still alive. Nothing happened. Ever so slowly, I opened my eyes to a deserted clearing. There was no sign of anyone. Light shone through the canopy of leaves high above me. Something wasn't right. How long had I been out?

Staggering to my feet, my heart beat wildly against my chest. Voldemort went back up to the school. Pausing only long enough to pick my glasses of the forest floor and shove them onto my face, I ran as hard and as fast as my sore legs could carry me. Thoughts of the fighting that must be raging on flew past my mind because surely Hogwarts wouldn't give up simply because I was announced dead. My lungs burned and the stitches in my sides ached sharply as I pushed myself on. Voldemort was venerable now more than ever. It was just the snake left, and them him. 

The rough terrain of gnarled roots and fallen tree limbs soon gave way to dead leaves and patches of grass. It wasn't long before I burst through the treeline. Never slowing, I raced up the steep lawn towards the castle. The sun rested in the middle of the sky, beating down my neck. As I grew closer to the school, an unsettling feeling toyed with my nerves. Where the courtyard had been in ruins when I entered the forest, it now stood unscathed. All signs of the battle had been erased. Pushing myself still further, I ran up the flawless stone steps. The Entrance Hall looked exactly the same as it had the first time I stepped foot in it. The marble floors shone cheerfully as my dirty sneakers slapped harshly against it. The doors to the Great Hall stood closed. Skidding to a stop in front of them, I pushed them open, pulling my wand out as I went.

All four House tables stood filled with students eating and laughing with one another. Confusion distorted my face and my steps faltered halfway to the staff's table When a knowing pair of electric blue eyes landed on me. 

Dumbledore.

My heart skidded to a stop. 

By now the room had fallen silent and every eye was on me. Tearing my eyes off the silvery-haired man before me, I turned my eyes to the Gryffindor in hopes of spotting Ron or Hermione. Long red hair caught my eye. Lily Evans sat there, looking at me with mild concern. A few seats down from her sat who could only be James Potter. They looked just like their pictures. The longer I looked, the more familiar faces appeared. Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black. All of them watching me with different degrees of concern. Turning to face Dumbledore once again, I spoke to while I slowly lowered my wand.

""Am I dead?""

My legs shook violently beneath me. No one moved. 

Of course, I wasn't dead, strangely enough. I knew I must look half-crazed. What with dirt and flecks of dried blood covering my face. Still, no one moved, except Dumbledore who stood. The only sound in the hall was the scraping of his chair legs against the floor followed by his footsteps. Whispers broke out across the hall as the watched their headmaster approach the wild looking girl. His blue eyes twinkled with concern. He placed a large hand on my slight shoulders and led me from the hall filled with prying eyes.

All the adrenaline I had felt leading up to this moment fled from my limbs, leaving me feeling as though I were filled with led. The next few hours flew by and were filled with worried faces and hushed whispers from professors as Madame Pomfrey scurried around me, checking for injuries. I didn't say a word. Some way, Somehow everything was fine. I-I had seen my parents, and Remus, and Sirius.  It was impossible and wonderful, and I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

When my cuts and scraps had been dealt with to Madame Pomfrey's satisfaction, Dumbledore conjured a plush red chair and sat at my bedside. 

He smiled kindly at me over his half-moon spectacles. ""Do you know who I am?""

A startled laugh bubbled on my lips. Of course, I knew who he was. The problem was he didn't know who I was. No one did. ""Professor Albus Dumbledore."" I paused a moment. ""You don't remember me, do you?""

""Alas, I'm afraid I can't say I do. Would you kindly tell me your name?""

I soothed the crisp white blanket that covered my lap. It was a strange feeling. Having spent the last seven years with my name being whispered behind hands and books wherever I went, and now to be completely anonymous...

""Harriah Potter.""

""Well, Miss Potter, tell me your story.""

And I did. Or I tried to. I had only gotten to the bit about Voldemort killing my parents when he stopped me.

""Who are your parents?""

""James and Lily Potter."" I hesitated. ""I saw them in the Great Hall earlier.""

Dumbledore looked thoughtful. ""What year would you say it is?""

I gave him a confused look. ""Er, 1998.""

He nodded with his hand on his chin. ""Unless I am dearly mistaken, Miss Potter, it's 1975.""

Is it a reunion if the other persons haven't met you yet?

Onto the next chapter! Thank you for the kudos and comments!!!Song for this Harry in this chapter is Feel the Wolves Without Teeth by Of Monsters and Men.Maurarders song is The Nights by Avicii

Hey everyone. I am so sorry about the delay!!! I want to clear up the time of year if is in the story. September 13!  So, I wanted to show everyone the difference in slang used in the 70's and late 90's and I'm not gonna lie. It was down right fun looking at all the different words used in the 70's. I guess you could say it was.... far out! lol Yes, I know this american slang, but the only bit of British slang I could find was 'cheerio', and that term came to be because the welsh mafia use to poison peoples breakfast cereal.

I spent the next two weeks being poked and prodded by Madame Pomfrey. She nearly exploded when she noticed the seemingly fresh 'I must not tell lies' cuts on the back of my hand. After trying to explain that they were years old and I hadn't the foggiest why they looked so fresh, she cleaned them once more before retrieving Dumbledore. The Headmaster had calmly listened to the mediwitch as she listed off different injuries, both seemingly new and old.

""Carved, Albus, into the back of her hand! What's more is she claims that she got them ages ago.""

Looking past his half-moon spectacles, Dumbledore looked to me. I sighed in irritation. ""Honestly, Professor, I've had them over two years.""

He looked thoughtful. ""Perhaps when you were sent to us, Miss Potter, you were made younger as well. How old were you when you received those scars?""

""I was fifteen. You don't think...?""

Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. ""That is exactly what I think.""

I rubbed my fingers over the lightning-shaped scar that rested on the right side of my forehead in both annoyance and frustration. I had hated being fifteen the first go round. Madame Pomfrey pursed her lips when she saw me rubbing my scar. Compared to when she had noticed that scar, she was being downright civil over the back of my hand. To an experienced mediwitch, it wasn't hard to tell that the strange lightning scar was the work of dark magic. Dumbledore had been truly intrigued to learn the cause of it, and Madame Pomfrey was horrified to hear me speak so plainly about it. When she noticed the scar left from the Basilisk and the other from where Pettigrew sliced into my arm she insisted on knowing how I got them, then telling Dumbledore. Other than those major scars, my skin was relatively clear. 

During the day, Dumbledore would come to my bedside to discuss what my plans were.

I tugged on the ends of my shoulder length black hair. ""I don't know, Professor. What can I do? I'm fifteen again, in the wrong time, have no money, and nowhere to go."" 

Sensing the frustration in my voice, Dumbledore spoke kindly. ""I had rather hoped you would finish your schooling here at Hogwarts until you are able to find your way back.""

My eyebrows rose slightly as relief tingled my chest. ""Really? Professor, I- thank you.""

Giving me a knowing smile, he stood. ""Very good. What house did you say you were in?""

Beaming up at him, I answered, ""Gryffindor.""

He nodded, seemingly pleased. ""I'll have some school robes delivered to you so you can join the rest of your peers for supper.""

That's how I found myself, dressed in a fresh uniform, leaving the hospital wing. Hogwarts hadn't changed one bit. The same paintings and marble walkways greeted me as I passed through on my way to the Great Hall. It was strange, seeing the school like this again and being here when a part of me still felt that there was a war to be fought. Has anyone noticed that I wasn't there anymore? What were Ron and Hermione doing without me? How could I get back to them, back to the war because surely it was at a great turning point? Only Voldemort and his wretched snake had been left to kill. My stomach grumbled loudly in the deserted corridor.

Food first, worries later. 

Laughter oozed out of the Great Hall as I approached. My steps faltered just outside the door. 'I can do this', I thought. 'No one knows who I am, I'll be fine. I will not sneak into the kitchens. Dumbledore is expecting to see me eating with my fellow Gryffindors. Besides, no one is gonna remember me from two weeks ago.' Feeling slightly better, I squared my shoulders and walked casually to the Gryffindor table. 

I was mostly right. No one knew who I was, but they certainly remembered two weeks ago when I burst into the Hall. At first, a few Gryffindors noticed me approaching their table. They nudged the people next to them, forming a chain reaction until everyone at the table gawked at me openly. It was at this moment that I truly missed my two best friends. Hermione would have rolled her eyes at how ridiculous the lot of them looked, Ron would have made a snarky comment, and I would have laughed at Hermione scolding Ron for his 'crass remarks'. As much as I wished I would spot them flagging me over, I didn't. Instead, I located the nearest empty seat, sat down, and loaded up my plate as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Luckily there were a good few seats between me and the rest of the House.

It was nice not having Madame Pomfrey giving me 'proper portions' because 'a girl your size can't possibly eat that much, and I won't have you wasting food!'. If there was one thing I loved about Hogwarts, it was the food. Roasted potatoes, roast beef, spotted dick, treacle tarts- it had been almost a year since I had had so much good food at my fingertips. The ice-cold pumpkin juice helped it all go down rather nicely.

When I couldn't possibly eat another bite and was feeling rather pleasant, I decided to see who I recognized. A few feet away sat a boy who I had only met once in my fifth year at St. Mungos. Frank Longbottom was laughing at something someone had said. I wouldn't have recognized him if his son, Neville, hadn't looked so much like him. My chest constricted at the sight of him. He had no idea that his and his wife, Alice, would suffer a fate worse than death. Any pleasant feeling I had had was further sapped away when my eyes moved on to Peter Pettigrew who was looking at James Potter in admiration as he talked enthusiastically to Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. There was nothing I wanted more than to meet them, meet the boy who would become my dad, but fear held me back. I couldn't risk changing their futures. No, it was best if I kept to myself until I found a way back to 1998.

It wasn't until the Hall became silent as the excited chatter died away, that I noticed Dumbledore had stood and was seeking our attention.

He smiled down at us, his eyes twinkling with that familiar mischief. ""Yet another delightful meal. Now, before you all scurry off to your warm beds,"" his eyes fell on the Gryffindor table where James and Sirius were giving him innocent looks. ""I have the pleasure of introducing our newest student and Gryffindor, Miss Harriah Potter.""

My face flushed in horror as every head in the Great Hall collectively turned to look at me and chatter broke out. 

""Potter?""

""I didn't know James has a sister.""

""Why would she start school so late?""

""What year do you reckon she's in?""

Dumbledore held up his hand and the room once again fell silent. ""I expect each of you to make her feel welcome. Now, off to your common rooms, I'm sure there is much studying to be done!""

I knew I should have eaten in the kitchens.

Students from every House craned their necks to catch a glimpse of me as they left the Great Hall. I took off my glasses and pretended to be cleaning a particularly stubborn smudge. It wasn't until someone cleared their throats next to me that I put my glasses back on and looked up to see who was trying to get my attention. 

Lily Evens and Remus Lupin stood waiting with polite smiles. I tried to keep my face neutral. ""Hello.""

Lily was even more beautiful than her pictures let on. Curtains of silky red hair fell carelessly around her slight shoulder, setting her bright green eyes on fire. Her full lips were curved into a pleasant smile. ""Hi, I'm Lily Evens, a fifth-year prefect. This is Remus Lupin, also a fifth-year prefect.""

Sliding off the bench, I couldn't help but notice that she was taller than me. Holding out my hand to shake, I smiled politely. ""I'm Harriah Potter, Call me Harry.""

Lily's smile widened. I let go of her hand and held it towards Remus. I immediately noted that it must not be a full moon yet because he looked well enough. His smile held thinly veiled curiosity.

""Well Harry,"" Remus said in a manner so much like he did when he taught me in my third year that it made my chest ache at seeing him alive and not lying dead in this very Hall. ""Let's show you to the Gryffindor common room.""

Of course, I knew where the common room was after six years of schooling, but they didn't know that. So I let them lead me up the Grand Staircase. Lily made sure to warn me about the trick step. ""So, Harry,"" Lily started. My shoulders tensed slightly. ""What year are you in?""

""Sev- fifth. I'm a fifth year.""

""Groovy! You'll be in my dorm then.""

Groovy? This was, after all, the 70's. It was amusing, to say the least. 

A few minutes later found us standing outside the common room, staring at the Fat Lady. ""Thunderbird."" Remus said pleasantly. The portrait swung open to reveal a, thankfully, fairly empty common room. Stepping over the threshold, I couldn't help but smile at the familiar site. My favorite overstuffed armchair stood next to an equally overstuffed couch. The same paintings hung of the scarlet red walls, a familiar fire blazed in the hearth. It was like coming home after a holiday spent with the Dursleys. The only thing missing was the proper people. Unfamiliar faces were buried in books and measuring the length of their essays. I guess it was more like visiting a house you use to call home and finding a different family living inside.

""Girl dorms are just us those stairs."" Lily was saying. 

I nodded. ""Thanks, Lily.""

It was strange, talking to my dead mum who had no idea I was the daughter that she would have with James Potter. A boy she would despise until her seventh year. That is if my presence didn't screw things up. What would happen then? Would I simply disappear? Shaking my head, I decided that if I simply avoided the whole lot of them, then everything would be fine. 

But, of course, it wasn't going to be that easy. Especially since James, Sirius, and Peter were walking over to join us. Bloody hell.

Can you go unnoticed when you share the same name as an infamous Marauder?


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

It was startling how similar I looked to James. The same untamable black hair, slim face, and full bottom lip were reflected back at me from the boy who would grow to become my father. There were, however, just as many differences. Where I was small and slight, James was tall and well built. My skin stayed pale year round. James's skin was kissed by the summer sun in a way I could only dream of. I had gotten my eyes from my mum, who stood next to me with her hands on her hips and a huff on her lips. 

""Evans,"" James said coolly, with a careless smile.

""Potter."" She said in a voice so cold, I almost shivered. Looking at me with a warm smile that was so vastly different from her reaction to James that it made me blink, she continued as if no one had interrupted. ""I'll see you in the dorm then, Harry.""

With a confident air about her, she left me to the wolves in favor of the other fifth year girls who all sat clustered around the same table that Hermione convinced me to teach other students defense against the dark arts in our fifth year. A year that I was now repeating, only without the comfort of my friends and in an unknown time. 

I felt myself shift uncomfortably when four sets of eyes sought out my face. For the first time I could remember, my eyes met James. The curiosity in his clear blue eyes was matched with the hesitance in my bright green eyes. For a moment we just watched each other, both curious for different reasons. 

""Blimey, James. You never told me you had a sister.""

Sirius leaned an elbow on James's shoulder. A smirk covered his mouth. He looked so different now, happy. There was no haunted look in his eyes, no sign that the carefree boy in front of me would spend twelve years in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit. 

""Neither did I."" James said, matching the smirk on his friends face perfectly. 

I squared my shoulders. ""I'm not your sister. Now if you lot will excuse me, I should like to go to my dorm now.""

Stepping past them, I walked through my new housemates and up the stairs to the girls' dorm. Pulling open the familiar door to the room designated for fifth-year girls, I walked to the only bed that looked empty of belongings. A smile found its way onto my lips when I saw my invisibility cloak folded neatly on the bed comforter. Next to it was the newly cleaned clothes I had arrived in. I grasped the wand that I had tucked safely away in the waistband of my skirt. This was all I had in the world. Even when I lived with the Dursleys I had more to my name. At the very least I had a roof over my head. Now, all that I owned was my dad's invisibility cloak, a set of worn clothes, and a wand that was never mine to begin with. Even when I lived with the Dursleys there had been more to my name.

Back in 1998, I had a vault brimming with galleon, sickles, and knuts left to me by my parents. In 1976 my parents had yet to leave me anything because I had yet to exist, and they weren't married. I ran my hand down my face. Dumbledore had promised to take care of my every expense while I remained here, but how long would that be? Surely it was only a matter of time before I made it back to my own time. 

I rubbed my scar and frowned. This was yet another thing that troubled me. My scar hadn't bothered me in two weeks. It could be that the Horcrux had been destroyed when Voldemort killed me with the killing curse, though I doubted it. Somehow I was back in my fifteen-year-old body, and shouldn't that mean that a part of Voldemort's soul still possessed a part of me? 

Head throbbing, I picked up the water like material of my cloak and set it in the trunk at the foot of my bed. Books, quills and parchment were stacked neatly inside for my lessons tomorrow along with a second uniform and PJs. A great nervousness settled on my shoulders at the thought of going to class. After the way everyone craned to get a look at the strange new girl, I knew that I would be getting more attention than I wanted. Merlin knew how it would affect the future. The last thing I needed was to somehow change the future for the worse.

The noise from the common room filtered through the door as I changed into PJs. I took my glasses off and set them on the nightstand before climbing under the warm covers of my new bed. Wand grasped tightly in my hand under my pillow, I fell into a dreamless sleep.

 

 

I woke up long before the other girls in my dorm. In the silence, I almost forgot I when I was. Staring up at the canopy, I could almost believe Hermione was about to draw back my curtains and drag me from the bed. But she wouldn't because she wasn't here. Little to no sound was made when I changed, cast a tangle-free charm on my hair, and gathered my books. stuffing them into a shoulder bag, I made my way down to the Great Hall just as the first hints of sunrise began to light the room.

The only house table with anyone at it was Ravenclaw, not that I was surprised. It was, after all, only 6:40 am. Most didn't start coming down until 8:00. My feet carried me over to the place Ron, Hermione, and I claimed since after Halloween in our first year. Loading my plate with eggs, bacon, and potatoes, I began to eat at a leisurely pace. I looked at the people who had already started eating their breakfast, mind empty for the first time in almost three years. It was nice. No one looked my way twice, and if they did I hadn't noticed. Since I first came to Hogwarts others would either gawk or try and strike up a conversation. In 1975, however, I was just another face in the crowd.

A boy with black greasy hair and a hook nose drew my eye as I watched him find a seat at the end of the Slytherin table. Propping up a book I knew all too well, he sat down and ignored the rest of us. It didn't take but a moment for me to realize who the boy was; Severus Snape. He looked, well, different. The same indifferent sneer, but still, different. For one, he wasn't the ugly git I knew he would grow up to be. Sure, his hair still hung in greasy locks, but there was something about him that I couldn't quite place my finger on that was different from the man I knew he would become. As though he could feel me watching him, he looked up. After years of staring him down in the potions classroom, I wasn't the least bit ashamed of being caught. His sneer grew. My heart clenched with the realization that this was the boy who loved my mother. He wasn't the terrifying potions master, just a boy.

I offered him a small smile. He would, after all, save my life more than once someday. Since I had seen his memories and gone into the dark forest, my view of him had changed. His thick eyebrows drew together before he must have decided to ignore me and go back to his breakfast and potions book. 

It didn't take long for people to shuffle in with yawns. Soon enough the hall was once more filled with chatter and the scraping of forks. I had almost finished my breakfast when Professor McGonagall came bustling over with a piece of parchment in her hands. 

""Potter, your schedule."" She said sternly, handing it to me. ""Should you find yourself with questions, I am your head of house. Any of your housemates can point you in my direction.""

""Thank you, Professor."" I said, looking up from my schedule.

With a nod, she made her way past me and out of the Great Hall. Reading the list, it seemed to mirror what my classes had looked like during my first fifth year.

 


Monday



First - History Of Magic



Second and Third - Double Potion



Lunch 



Fourth - Muggle Studies



Fifth and Sixth - Double Defence Against The Dark Arts



 


I raised an eyebrow at muggle studies. When Dumbledore had asked me about elective classes, I told him anything but divination. At least I wouldn't have to work hard in that class. The rest of the week held similar classes with my other elective being Care of Magical Creatures. A smile that had begun to form was wiped quickly away. For a fleeting moment, I thought of Hagrid's lessons, until I remembered it wasn't until my third year that Hagrid was made a Professor. It was in this all-consuming loneliness that I noticed two persons were sitting down on either side me.

Looking to my left in slight confusion, I met a pair of blue eyes I had been hoping to avoid. James. Turning to my right revealed Sirius with an easy smirk in place. ""Bloody hell.""

""Here that, James? I don't think she likes us."" Sirius said.

James placed his hand over his heart in feign hurt. ""But, Harry, we're related.""

My shoulders tensed when Remus sent me an apologetic smile from across the table, and Peter watched me with awe. This was exactly what I had been hoping to avoid. Panic built in my chest. Squash it down, Potter. Forcing my body to relax, I turned back to my now cold food. 

When I took another bite of bacon instead of answering, James took it upon himself to fill the silence. ""It's not every day you find a long-lost relative, Harry.""

Everything in me wanted nothing more than to know the boy who would become my father, someone I knew next to nothing about. I wanted to hug Sirius, tell him how much I missed him. I wanted to tell Remus how sorry I was that he would die because of me. I wanted to keep them safe from Peter. And I wanted to change their future. My future.

""Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody!"" * Hermione's voice whispered in my ear. ""Awful things happen when wizards have meddled with time.""*

So instead of doing any of that, I did the hardest thing I had ever done. I stayed silent and ate another slice of bacon. Glancing at my watch, I saw it was only 8:32. History of magic was on the third floor, so I wouldn't have to leave for another fifteen minutes to get there. Just as I made to put my Schedule in my bag and leave, Sirius picked it up.

""Brilliant, same classes,"" he said, looking it over.

Snatching it back, I shoved it into my bag. ""Shove off, Black.""

""Now Harry,"" James said in a playfully stern voice. ""Is that any way to treat someone? What if he were to die tomorrow?""

My hand slammed down on the table top as I shot to my feet, and all but ran to the first class. Tears prickled in my eyes. He didn't know, none of them did. They were dead men walking.

* means it's an actual quote from the books. These are from book three.

An apology is owed, and the prying begins.

Leaning up against the wall next to History of Magic, I pinched the bridge of my nose. It was hard not to be angry at James for what he had said. It wasn't like he knew what he had been saying, and the shocked looks on their faces had been evidence enough that he hadn't thought what he was saying was anything short of playful, a way to get me to talk. I could understand his curiosity. After all, if someone had shown up looking like me with the name Potter, I would want to know them as well. But a larger part of me was enraged at his careless words. Did that really seem the thing to say to someone who'd burst into the Great Hall, hair filled with twigs, clothes torn, and covered in a sloppy mixture of dirt, dust, and blood asking if they were dead?

Dropping my hand to my side, I let out a huff. Great job I had done, not drawing attention. I should have stayed in control. Had I simply ignored James, I probably would have lost his attention far sooner than having caused a scene like that. A few minutes passed before the corridor began to fill with students going to their lessons. I walked into the classroom and sat down in the front, taking out a quill, inkpot, and roll of parchment. Normally, I would have chosen a seat in the back. The way Professor Binns droned on was a sure fire way to put even the most attentive students to sleep. It was also likely that had I sat in the back, James or Sirius would have tried to talk to me again. Besides, I had already done my fifth year before and Binns would only teach about one thing this year; giant wars.

It wasn't long before the other fifth years trickled into the classroom. To discourage anyone from approaching me, I pulled out a textbook at random, flipped to a random page, and pretended to read. I had never really liked books the way Hermione had. Sure, they were okay. Especially the one she had given me in our first year, Quidditch Through The Ages. Even those trashy love novels I had insisted she buy for me after our third year was almost fun. A textbook on things I already knew, however, was not something I would likely pick up for a bit of light reading.

""Mind if I sit here?"" Remus asked, gesturing to the empty desk next to my right.

I shrugged without meeting his eyes and went back to the textbook I was pretending to read. Out of the corner of my eye, I watched him pull out the chair and sit down before pulling out supplies he would need to take notes on the lecture. Barking laughter told me that Sirius and James had just walked in with Peter trailing faithfully behind them. 


""Hero-worshipped Black and Potter, never quite in their league, talent-wise.""*


How did this seemingly harmless boy become the monster who would betray my parents? If only they knew what he would become if only I could somehow stop it... Shaking my head slightly, I turned my eyes back to the text in front of me. It wouldn't do to have these thoughts. The simple truth was that I could do nothing but watch and try and have as little impact as I could. Dwelling on what might have been would drive me mad. No, I had to find a way back to 1998 as quickly as I could. 

""Harry?""

Remus drew me from my thoughts. It was strange seeing him like this. The long scar that crossed his face had yet to appear, and his hair held no traces of grey yet. 

""I just wanted to apologize, for earlier."" When I didn't say anything, he rushed on. ""James can be a prat sometimes, but I know he wouldn't have said that had he known.""

""Know what?"" I asked before I could stop myself. Curiosity had always been my fatal flaw, but I still found myself wanting to know what conclusions they had drawn after I had practically run from them.

Remus hesitated. When I raised my eyebrow, he finally continued. ""Well, I mean, you've obviously lost someone close to you.""

""No. I lost everyone.""

 

The next few days passed relatively quietly. No doubt thanks to Remus who would have told James and Sirius to back off. The hardest person to avoid, it seemed, was Lily. Sharing a dorm made it that much harder. Despite my best effort to remain distant, She was putting twice as much effort into becoming friends. Af dinner she would hunt me down and insist I sit with her and her friends. When I refused, she gathered her friends and they moved to the end of the table where I sat alone. It was times like these that I wished I had told Dumbledore I belonged in Slytherin. At least them no one would have bothered trying to befriend me and if they had, they'd have no doubt given up after the first day. 

Lying on my back, I stared sightlessly at the canopy of my four post bead. My fingers traced over my lightning-shaped scar. This was the source of all my trouble. This tiny mark. Strange how in 1998 it meant so much to so many people, but in 1975 it was just a scar. 

The curtain to my bed was pulled aside by a smiling Lily. She held up a six-pack of cider and bag of jumping snakes in one hand, and nail polish in the other. ""Scoot over, Harry.""

With a sigh, I made room for her on my bed. She pulled the curtains closed around me and lit the end of her wand while I did the same. It was hard not to like Lily, she was trying so hard to make me feel welcome. A selfish part of me was happy for the chance to know her. I wanted this more than I had ever wanted anything in my entire life. So I pushed down any feeling of guilt I had and tried to enjoy this stolen moment with her.

""Scarlet?"" Lily asked, holding up the color. ""Or gold?""

I smiled slightly. ""Scarlet.""

Carefully unscrewing the top, Lily took my right hand in hers. I tensed she took notice of the scars on the back of my hand. I Must Not Tell Lies. A moment of stiff silence fell before she simply began to paint. 

""So I couldn't help but notice that you don't seem to have any clothes other than the ones you arrived in. The first Hogsmeade visit is the weekend of Halloween, so I thought you might want to go shopping with me.""

""I, uh,"" Clearing my throat, I continued. ""I don't have any money.""

""Don't worry about that, I have it covered,"" Lily said brightly.

""I can't ask you to cover it, Lily."" I shook my head.

""Oh, I'm not.""

""Then who-""

She cut me off with a knowing smile. ""You'll see. Until then you can borrow my clothes.""

After my nails dried we opened the of jumping snakes and the cider. It was nice talking to her. She didn't ask me about my past, and I didn't share. She told me about her sister Petunia and her parents. We talked about classes. The ones we liked (Defence Against The Dark Arts), the ones we didn't (History Of Magic). While I knew this was wrong, I basked in this time we shared. I could almost forget when I was. 

That night I slept better than I had in months.

With the start of October brought a chill in the air. Scarves began to make their first appearances along with gloves. It was a nice change. Especially with the evening fires to help battle any lingering cold in the common room. 

Lily was true to her word, and the next morning she searched through her trunk for something I could wear. She finally decided on a dark blue cashmere sweater with jeans, and the brown boots I had arrived in. I thanked her before changing into the borrowed outfit. In truth, I had never worn casual clothes this nice before. Many of my clothes consisted of Dudley's worn ones that Hermione had helped me take in so they would fit better. Spending the better part of a year on the run hadn't helped either. My hair was left to its own devices as it never was tamable.

""Let's get breakfast, I'm starving,"" Lily said once she was satisfied everything fit.

Following her down to the Great Hall, I found it was so easy to be near her. Knowing that Lily wanted to be my friend made going back that much harder. I didn't want to lose this. How do you stay away from the people that mean the most to you when you know your time with them is limited. In six years, just six short years, Lily and James would die protecting me. Was it selfish to want to change that? To get back the years that had been stolen by a madman in his quest for power?

Instead of walking towards the Gryffindor table, Lily steered me towards the Slytherin table. At the questioning look I shot her, she just rolled her eyes and sat down next to Severus Snape. I hesitated before sitting across from them. Severus raised an eyebrow. Lily must not bring friends to sit with him often, if ever.

""Harry, this is Severus. Severus, Harry.""

I offered a slight smile that he didn't return. I didn't exactly expect him to like me. Not when I looked so much like James.

""Hi,"" I said.

""Hello."" I could tell he was only trying for Lily, but at least he was trying. 

He then turned to Lily, who in turn was making every effort to include me. I watched them talk with strange amusement. How different he seemed, talking to her, more...human. 

""...what do you think Harry?"" Lily asked me brightly.

""Oh,"" I said, having no idea what they had been discussing. ""Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.""

""She asked how you felt about Gryffindor's odds of winning the Quidditch cup this year."" Severus sneered impatiently.

In my first year after I had learned my dad had been a great Quidditch player, I had taken it upon myself to learn just how good a player he was. Turns out this is the only year they didn't win the cup while he was on the team because of the lack of a decent seeker.

""Gryffindor and Slytherin are well matched, but Ravenclaw will take the cup this year."" When they gave me odd looks, I added quickly, ""Or so I've heard.""

'Well done, Potter.' I thought sarcastically. 'Why don't you give them the final score while you're at it.'

Harry makes a decision.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

That afternoon I found myself sitting alone beneath a tree next to the black lake. A couple of first years were throwing stone into the water, and laughed each time the giant squid tossed them back. I had an unexpectedly pleasant morning with Lily and Severus. Because Slytherin and Gryffindor had potions together, Lily had suggested that we all retire to the library and finish our essays on Shrinking Solutions together.

""Harry, you have to cite your work."" Lily scolded when I just started writing rather than gather books for research.

""I am."" I said, slightly confused. ""See, this bit, 'Shrinking solutions are best balanced when using fresh eye of newt rather than pickled' is from A Potion Master's Guide, and 'when dealing with a shrivelfig, it's best to slowly drain over a period of twenty minutes before it can be skinned and then added' is from One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.""

Still, Lily insisted that I find the books, and was astounded that I had quoted them near perfectly. ""You must really like Shrinking Solutions."" She said, shaking her head in bemusement.

""Not really. Truthfully the only reason I know any of that is because Hermione insisted I-"" I stopped short when my mind caught up with my mind. 

In my original fifth year, Hermione thought if I stayed focused on my studies I could better ignore the rumors being spread about me in the Daily Prophet. I had given it a go out of desperation, and had decided to never again follow that bit of advice. All it got me were headaches from reading too long, and an acute dust allergy from the books in the library.

""Anyway,"" I said after an awkward pause. Lily wore a poorly hidden look of concern. ""I know more than I could ever care to know about it.""

Severus had watched the exchange silently, before proceeding criticize my essay in a way only he could; complete with sneers and jabs about my intelligence. I found a strange sort of comfort in the way that somethings would never change. I must have been far more homesick than I realized if Severus Snape was pulling at my heartstrings.

""It seems your not as incompetent as the other Potter."" Severus begrudgingly said after he insisted on checking my paper and only making minor changes in the phrasing. 

I laughed at the irony of the almost compliment. ""Thanks, Severus. You really know how to chat a girl up.""

Lily laughed lightly as Severus scowled. Though it lost some of it's effect due to the pale pink staining his cheeks. 

It had been a rather unexpectedly pleasant morning. Sunlight filter through the canopy of leaves, leaving a pretty pattern across my jeans. The slight chill in the air had me returning to the castle and made me immensely thankful for the warm cashmere sweater Lily had lent me. The ground was littered with student who seemed unbothered by the chilly weather. In all honesty, the cold had never bothered me much. It was the curious stares that followed me and poorly hidden whispers that made me retreating back inside. At least in my dorm, I could get some privacy. It was exhausting, hiding who I was, constantly worrying how my actions would affect the future. 

Then corridor was blissfully empty. Dinner was still an hour away, leaving me contemplating if a trip to the common room would be worth it. It would kill time, but my chances of running into the marauders made me hesitate. I was already being careless by allowing Lily in, but to chance Remus and Sirius, even Peter, recognizing my in the future, or changing how their lives unraveled was too reckless, even for me. Tempting fate like that was not something I was willing to risk. The feeling of caring the weight of everyone's lives, both past and present, crushed down on me. I wanted to scream, or run, or find a broom and just fly. I wanted to leave this fear, this guilt, and anger behind.  My muscles trembled beneath my skin.

I needed to speak with Dumbledore. 

My feet carried me down the familiar path to the Headmasters office. If anyone could help me, it was him. I racked my brain for the password as I stood in front of the gargoyle that guarded Dumbledore's office.

""Sherbert lemon.""

The gargoyle leapt to the side and allowed me to pass. Rasping my knuckles against the door, I waited for the familiar call to enter.

""Harry,"" Dumbledore greeted in a pleasant manor. ""How may I help you this evening?""

""I want to know them, my parents. But I can't because I'm not meant to! It wasn't suppose to be this way. Lily wants to be my friend, James thinks that I'm some sort of long lost sister, Remus pities me, and god knows what Sirius is thinking!"" I burst out, unable to stop the words that had been building since I learned I had somehow managed to get myself sent back twenty-three years. ""And all the while I have to hide who I really am because if anyone knew, I could destroy the future!""

Dumbledore looked thoughtful as he pressed his fingertips together beneath his chin. ""What a strange situation you find yourself in, Harry. In truth, I cannot say I know what course of action would be best to follow, To my knowledge, nothing of this sort has ever occurred before. Perhaps the wisest thing to do would be nothing at all.""

I plopped down into an overstuffed armchair. ""You want me to do nothing?""

""The choice is, of course, yours to make. You can carve your own future here, or you can simply wait to find a way back. Whatever course of action you choose, I think it best if you were to keep any details of both who you are and the time you come from to yourself. Knowledge such as this can have terrible consequences if it were to fall into the wrong hands.""

My fingers traces over the scar on my forehead in frustration. ""But I was once told that meddling with time was dangerous, that I could ruin the future or make it so I was never born.""

Dumbledore peered over his half moon spectacles at me. ""Magic works in strange ways. Most witches and wizards see it as only a tool to control. In truth it's far more complex than that. Magic is a force with a will all of it's own. It has seen fit to bring you here. I can only speculate as to what that reason is. You have been given this power, Harry, and it is up to you how you wield it. Now, I should think it's time for supper.""

Taking it all in I nodded, distracted by this new information. What was the reason behind my being here? At dinner Lily must have noticed I was distracted.

""-Harry?""

I looked up from pushes peas around my plate. ""Sorry?""

She placed a dainty hand on my arm. ""Is everything alright?""

""Oh, yes. Sorry. Just got lost in my thoughts is all.""

Lily opened her mouth, but closed it with a scowl. James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter had moved over to join us. It was strange to think that this girl, who so obviously loathed James, would one day fall in love with him. If I wasn't a direct result of it, I might not ever think it possible.

""Evans,"" James greeted politely. ""Harry.""

""Hello."" I said, uncertain. 

""Quidditch tryouts are tomorrow."" Sirius said after a moment. ""Either of you gonna try your luck?""

""Definitely not."" Lily said almost before he had gotten all the words out.

I hesitated. Quidditch was one of the best thing in the world, and getting the chance to play with my dad was beyond anything I had ever hoped for. Dumbledore had said I should live my life here, at least until I managed to make it back to 1998. After all, how much could I change by simply trying out for the team? There was no guarantee I would even make the team, after all.

""I think I will."" 

James grinned at me. ""What position?""

""Seeker. It's the only one I've ever played."" I explained.

Little did I know that this one choice would change everything. There would be no going back.

 

Hey everyone, I hope you enjoyed that last chapter and Harry's interaction with Lily. Feedback is alway welcome!

Quidditch try-outs and shaky friendships.

I had never officially tried out for a quidditch team before. McGonagall had given me the position on the team as an alternative to detention, one that I gladly took. After that, there was never any need. Oliver Wood and Angela Johnson had both decided that I was there was, then I was captain in my sixth year. I had, as every team member was required to do, watched the trials. It consisted of typical things such as laps around the field, drills, even a mock game. This was, however, not what I found when I joined the line of hopefuls.

""Alright, you mangy lot!"" A seventh year boy hollard from where he stood. ""For those of you who don't know, the positions you will be trying for are seeker and chaser. Behind me you may have noticed a few minor obstacles. You will have to make it through those to even be considered. Once we've weeded out the useless ones, who ever has the best time takes the position. Chasers first!""

The 'few obstacles' consisted of three parts. The first looked fairly simple. Thirty hoops were floating, scattered around the field. The flyer must make it through all thirty hoops. The hoops themselves moved about. And if that wasn't enough, the field had been subjected to several climate control spells. Howling winds in one section, pouring rain in another, and a blizzard in the last. The group of Gryffindors competing for chaser lined up. The first boy had just make it to the first hoop when the bludgers were released. All five of them. 

After seeing this, quite a few hopefuls turned instead to the stands, joining those who had simply come to watch. I could just make out Lily sitting with a group of girls, and looking on with equal parts fascinating and weariness. The group went from thirty to fifteen, all while watching the first boy being carted off to the hospital wing. 

When the first boy made it through, a cheer went up in the stands. It had been exhilarating to watch as he raced through the hoops, dodged the bludgers, and battled the elements to the finish line. I felt myself itching for a chance to have a go. Clenching the handle of the broom Remus was letting me borrow, I shifted my wand from my pocket and cast the impervius charm on my glasses. It was a nifty spell Hermione had show me in our third year to repel water. Squashing down the sudden wave of longing I always felt when I thought about Ron and Hermione, I shifted my focus to the upcoming challenge. 

""Seekers, you're up!"" 

A fourth year boy stepped up, mounted his broom, and took off at the whistle. He maneuvered well through the hoops. It was when he got to the blizzard section that a bludger caught him on the side of the head, sending him tumbling down into the grass below. When I stepped up I could hear Lily give a cheer. Mounting my broom, I shot forward at the whistle.

The strong wind forced me to fly nearly sideways while racing through the hoops. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted a bludger barreling towards me, forcing me to roll side ways, into the next climate. The rain soaked me instantly and set a deep chill in my bones. Water flew past my glasses, the charm working perfectly. The bludger in this section almost seemed to be waiting for me, coming straight for my face. Looping through the air, I zig zagged through the hoops, all the while hearing the unmistakable crack of a bludger tearing through the wooden hoops like they would bone. 

The moment I crossed the climate barrier, all the rainwater that had collected on my clothes and body froze. My joints stiffened against the numbing cold, making any maneuvering all the more difficult. I was once again grateful for the charm I placed on my glasses when no frost built up on the lenses. Snow quickly covered my hair and shirt, sticking to the ice that had built up. This section was the most difficult for many reasons.

1. Having just come from the raining climate, all the water instantly froze. The cold was so intense, your muscles began seizing up.

2. The hoops moved about, some slowly, others rather quickly.

3. This section contained three bludgers.

The frozen air burned my lungs. It was difficult, to say the least, trying to predict where the hoops would go next while trying not to get pumped by flying balls and snow. After the second time of having to swerve out of the way of a bludger, I had to find a way to put the out of commision and quickly. I pulled sharply upwards on the handle of my broom and shot straight up. The three blood thirsty balls eagerly followed. Making a sudden backwards loop, I plummeted straight towards the ground, urging the broom to move faster. Snow bit into my skin as that familiar giddy feeling twisted in my gut. Yanking the broom up, I pulled out of the dive faster than the bludgers were able and sped through the last remaining hoop and across the finish line.

The frozen water no longer mattered as I yelled in victory. I made it through the first round!

My feet hit the ground as a cheer rose through those seated in the stands. Lily could be heard over the rest, waving like mad. A wide grin took over my face as I waved back, adrenaline still pumping through my body. James and Sirius approached before clapping me on the shoulder.

""What did I tell you, Sirius? Potters were born to fly."" James said proudly.

Sirius ruffled my hair, no doubt making it worse than it already was. ""Our little Harry, zooming around like it was nothing.""

""Cut it out, you two. It was no more difficult than flying around a dragon."" I said waving them off.

""And, pray tell,"" James said with a raised eyebrow, ""How exactly would you know?""

""I-I don't! Obviously, I was just making a comparison."" I hurried to say.

""Pretty strange comparison."" Sirius said grimly. ""I think we've got a dragon slayer on our hands, James.""

""Indeed. If ever there is a dragon to face, we must grovel at the feet of Hariah, and pray she can defeat the mighty beast!"" James declared dramatically.

I huffed in slight amusement as they then proceeded to bow and in Sirius's case literally sing my praises. 

""Oi!"" Yelled the captain after everyone had a go at the obstacles. ""If you two idiots are quite done, we have try outs to finish.""

""Just and merciful captain!"" Cried James.

""Brave and true!"" Hollard Sirius.

""Shut it!"" The captain growled, clearly used to the antics of those two. ""Right then. There was quite a bit of fair flying out there today. Our new chase is Greg Lestrade, and our seeker is Hariah Potter. The rest of you, great job. Now clear off my field.""

A rush of pride filled me. This was something I could do, where I could be 100% me and hold nothing back. As I walked off the field, James and Sirius on either side of me, they took the liberty of filling me in on practice times, the game schedule, and discussed, over the top of my head, what broomstick would be best. 

I cleared my throat awkwardly. ""I don't, uh, have any money for brooms."" In 1998 it wouldn't have been a problem due to my vault filled with wizard gold.

""Not to worry, Harry. Mum's over the moon about you. No doubt she'll jump at the chance to dote on you."" James said.

""Why?"" I asked in confusion.

""She always wanted a girl. Your like a dream come true for her."" He explained.

I furrowed my eyebrows. ""But I'm not-""

""My long lost sister? Don't tell her that unless you want to crush her."" He continued with a smirk. 

""Besides,"" Sirius said. ""you really could be for all we know. James might be your twin. Imagine, being a sister to that prat.""

""Hey!"" James exclaimed in pretend offense. ""I'm the best big brother. Right, Harry?""

By now we had reached the Great Hall where the two of them steered me to where Remus and Peter had already started their lunch.

""You joining us today, Harry?"" Remus asked politely, saving me from having to scramble for an answer to James's question.

""It appears that way."" I said with an unsure smile. The last time Remus and I spoke, I wasn't exactly friendly.

Once I was seated between James and Sirius, Remus spoke again.

""We saw your trials, excellent flying.""

""Thanks. I'm told I get it from my dad."" I told him sheepishly. 

""He must be a brilliant flyer then."" James said as he shoveled food into his mouth.

""The best, I'm told."" I said with a secret smile.

Lily plopped down next to Remus with more grace than I had in my little finger. ""Great job Harry. You nearly gave me a heart attack with that dive you pulled.""

""You should have seen Mc- I mean you should have seen the first time I did that.""

I swallowed down the frustration of the half truths I was being forced to tell. McGonagall had nearly throw a fit in my first year when she saw me pull off a similar dive. But they couldn't know that, and they never would.

""Well, it was rather impressive. Did you play quidditch before you came to Hogwarts?"" She asked, graciously ignoring my slip up. 

No. ""Yes. I played seeker with my mates.""

""Y- you did good."" Peter chimed in.

My stomach clenched painfully. ""Er, thanks.""

Peter seemed pleased with my response. This was the boy who would betray my parents, get Sirius sent to Azkaban, and raise Voldemort to his former power. So much death would follow him, but I couldn't bring myself to see this plump, nervous boy as the murderer he would become. How could someone who became pleased with a short reply grow into the man who would destroy my life and that of countless others?

How indeed.

Harry must learn how to deal with the horrors in her past.

Over 300 kudos!!!!!! You guys are awesome. I'm not pleased with how this one came out, bit here ya go.


I stood in the middle of a graveyard. My ragged breathing was loud in the still night air. Cedric had to be here, we arrives together. I turned, moving quickly through the broken and decaying headstones. I had to find him before Voldemort did.



""Harry!"" Cedric yelled from somewhere in the distance. 



""Where are you?"" I called out in panic.



My body felt like it was moving through syrup. Why couldn't I move faster? 



""Avada kedavra!"" a cruel voice rang though the still night. 



A flash of all too familiar green light light up the Graves before me. Voldemort held his wand out and Cedric's body feel lifeless and cold into an open grave. 



""Cedric!"" I yelled, fear gripping me as I pushed forward to where his body fell. 



My stomach churned when I bent over the open grave. Inside lay the bodies of Ron, Hermoine, Fred, Tonks, Sirius, James, Lily, Remus, Colin, Severus, and Cedric.



A scream shattered the night.


I shot up in bed, eyes burning and my wand gripped tightly in my fist. Lily stood over me with a terrified expression, and the other girls in my dorm stood back, varied expressions of fear clear even without my glasses on. 

I reached out to the bedside table and slammed them onto my face. My chest heaved and my body trembled. The room stood frozen as I struggled to pull myself together. 

This was the fist dream I'd had since I arrived here. It had been so vivid that I half expected to see Voldemort burst into the dorm.

""Harry?"" Lily said hesitantly.

I lowered my wand. 

She took a step closer. Hot tears of relief pooled in my eyes before making cool trails down my cheeks. Lily was okay, they all were.

Lily sat on the edge of my bed before wrapping her arms tightly around me. ""Shh, it's alright. It was just a dream.""

A terrible sob rose from my chest as I clung to her. She was alive, she was safe.

The door burst open, making me jump, wand pointed sharply at the entrance. A girl walked in with McGonagall hot on her heels. The head of house took in the sight of me, eyes puffy and running. Her expression softened.

""Come with me, Miss Potter."" She said gently, holding out her arm.

My arm shook as I lowered my wand, one arm still gripping Lily. It took several moments for my body to relax and obey. I hated when this happened, when my fear caught up with me. Hermoine never once complained when my nightmares kept us both up at night when we were on the run. She would simply climb into bed with me and twiddle with my hair or hold me while I cried. She and Ron both. He often made me a warm cuppa, saying it was what him mum did when he was upset, and it would work wonders. But they weren't here.

Another moment passed before I realized I still hadn't let go of Lily. She helped me untangle myself from the covers before leading me to where McGonagall stood. The Professor wrapped an arm around my shoulder and led me from the tower. The common room was empty, and the fire had burned itself down to embers. I allowed myself to be led out the portrait hole and down the the hospital wing. The stone floor was cold against my bare feet. 

McGonagall muttered a quick spell and a blue light shot from her want and flew from the room. Madame Pomfrey hurried over with something clenched in her hand.

""On the bed, Miss Potter."" She said in a gentle voice.

""I'm fine."" My voice was hoarse.

It made me angry that I couldn't handle one nightmare. During the nine months I had spent on the run, I was fine. My sleep was dreamless. Now when there was no one fight they started up again? It left me wondering what was wrong with me.

Madame Pomfrey regarded me with a stern look. ""Of course you are. Now on the bed.""

I did as I was told, embarrassed because I had woken everyone up.

The medi witch placed a steaming Goblet in my hand. I took the calming draft, grimacing at the bitter taste. Slowly my muscles relaxed and the adrenalin wore off leaving me exhausted. I handed back the goblet as the hospital wing doors opened and in walked the Headmaster.

""You've caused quite the stir, Harry."" He said, not unkindly. When I didn't say anything he continued. ""Nightmares are not uncommon for those who have suffered, and you have suffered more than most.""

My eyes flickered to my head of house. Her lips thinned slightly, no remembering the manner in which I had arrived. Looking at Dumbledore once more, I drew my eyebrows together.

""I- I thought they had stopped.""

His eyes shone with understanding. ""The mind is a fickle thing. In times of war, soldiers will sleep, minds clear. It's when the return home that they learn it's followed them. A lot has happened to you in the past year alone. Nightmares are to be expected, and with time they will pass.""

It sure didn't feel like it. Not when I knew what was coming.

 

At the insistence of Madame Pomfrey, I spent the night in the hospital wing. Thanks to the calming draft I managed to sleep without any more nightmares. Light filtered in through the windows. Rubbing sleep from my eyes, I sat up. It had been a while since the sun was up before me. My body ached from sleeping for so long.

""Morning."" A red haired blur said from the end of my bed.

Putting on my glasses, I said, ""What time is it?""

""A little after 8:00."" Lily said. She held up a bundle of clothes. ""I grabbed you a clean uniform.""

""Thanks."" I muttered, embarrassed as I remembered last night.

Lily moved the screen so I could change. The air was heavy with her questions, but she stayed silent. Once I was dressed, I pulled the screen to the side.

The pretty girl in front of me hesitated. ""You know, Harry, if you ever wanna talk I here.""

Swallowing past my guilt, I nodded. ""I know... Thank you, for last night.""

Sympathy shone in her eyes. ""What are friends for? Now I don't know about you, but I could eat a hypogryff.""

Lily was a master of steering conversation. None of the girls from our dorm brought up what had happened, but judging from the looks I was getting, the news of my nightmare had traveled quickly among my housemates. 

Alice, the girl who would one day be Nevilles mother, asked me how I was liking Hogwarts.

""It's nice."" I said. ""Peeves is bit of work, though. He baracaded one of the secret passageways and refused to let anyone though unless they set fire to their trousers.""

Alice laughed. ""In my first year, he started shooting spitballs from inside a suit of armor.""

""I hope no one actually set themselves on fire."" Annabeth, a sixth year girl said, brow creased in worry. 

""I'm sure no one did."" Lily said as she took a drink of pumpkin juice. ""Not even Potter's that thick.""

""Talking about me, Evans?"" 

James plopped down in the empty seat next to me with a roguish smile. 

""Only terrible things, I assure you."" Lily said stiffly.

Alice cut in before James could say anything to set off the fiery redhead. ""It's uncanny how much you two look alike.""

I shifted uncomfortably as James slung his arm around my shoulders. ""Good genes. Isn't that right, sister mine?""

""James,"" I groaned. ""I'm not your sister.""

""And yet, here you are. My unofficial twin."" He replied.

I rolled my eyes but let it go. ""Where's the rest of your lot?""

""Remus was still trying to get Peter up, and Sirius was still styling his hair when I left."" He told me, snagging a piece of toast from my plate. 

Just then, the mail began to arrive. Hundreds of owls swooped down to find the people their letters and parcels were addressed to. A large package was dumped onto my plate, sending food in many different directions. 

My eyebrows scrunched together. Who was sending me things? A letter was attached with my name gleaming at me in an elegant scrawl. 


Hariah,



It is with great tidings that I write to you. My name is Euphemia Potter. It has been brought to my attention that you have arrived at Hogwarts. James has written to me about you, and it is my deepest wish that we should get to know you. Please except this gift as a token of my new found affection.



Euphemia Potter



P.S I do hope you like it.


Looking up from the letter, James smiled at me expectantly. 

""Why is your mum sending me things?"" I asked.

""I told you, she's always wanted a daughter."" He said, impatiently. ""Are you going to open it?""

I hesitated before dragging the long pristinely wrapped package towards me. It was almost a shame to rip such nice wrappings, but curiosity triumphed.

A long dark box opened to reveal one of the most beautiful brooms I had ever seen. A sleek cherry wood handle gleamed up at me, ending in a group of neatly bound twigs. I ran my hand over the cool wood, at a loss for words. 

I looked up at Lily who was smiling encouragingly at me from across the table.

James whisled in appreciation. ""A Silver Arrow 320. That's the top broom this year. 0-70 in five seconds.""

""I- I don't know what to say."" I finally stuttered.

""I'd start with 'thank you'."" Sirius said as he slid into the seat on my left. 

I snorted. ""Right."" Turning to James, I said, ""You will tell her thank you from me?""

He rolled his eyes. ""Tell her yourself. I'm sure she'd be thrilled to get a letter from you.""

Mind made up, I hurried upstairs to pit my new broom away before rushing to potions.

 

Potions with Slughorn was, as always, rather tedious. He would try to cracking a joke (no one laughed) or offer encouragement to those he felt needed it (annoying smiles and 'words of wisdom'). This was, however, a class shared with Slytherin. 

Lily had dragged me over to sit with Severus, who offered me a curt nod in way of greeting. Considering he had only ever sneered at me back in my time, I counted this as a victory. 

""Not worm wood, Ash wood."" He snapped at me when I went to add the wrong ingredient. 

""Right, thanks."" I muttered.

Tapping my wand over the cauldron, I repeated the incantation before increasing the heat. Potions had never been my strong suit. It was nice taking the class with Snape, rather than him giving the lesson. He could be very helpful when he wanted, even if it was only for Lily's sake.

""I was thinking."" Lily said as she stired her pale blue potion. ""The three of us hold have lunch outside. It might be the last chance we have for a while.""

Severus nodded, making me laugh. He turned a sharp gaze on me. ""Sorry, I just find it hard to imagine you outside.""

""And pray tell, how do you imagine me?"" He sneered.

There was the Snape I knew. ""Bent over a cauldron, or an old tome of spells. Mostly in dark places, honestly.""

""I don't think I like being in your thoughts, Potter."" He said.

""Where would you rather be, Severus?""

A muscle in his jaw twitched when Lily let out a musical laugh. 

 

Harry let's it out. James and Sirius discuss wedding plans.

Here's a short one to make up for the lack of frequent updates. Enjoy!

Andrew Jenkins was unlike any quidditch captain I had ever had. Oliver Wood was eccentric, and pushy. Angelina Johnson had been tough and no-nonsense. Andrew Jenkins, however, was demanding and quite the perfectionist.

""Again!"" He yelled from where he was punched on his broom. ""Lestrade, tighten you grip and tuck your elbow. A first year could steal the quaffle from you!""

As everyone moved back into position, I continued to dive and spin while trying to catch the small balls Jenkins had charmed to zoom around the pitch. After nearly three hours you'd think he'd at least be semi pleased with the progress made. 

""Potter, they're not gonna catch themselves!"" 

Speak of the devil. 

After another thirty minutes past before the practice was finally called off much to the relief of everyone but the Jenkins. One of the chasers explained that McGonagall had forbide him from keeping us through dinner. My muscles were stiff and ached from leaning over a broom for the majority of the evening. In the locker room, I snatched a crisp white towel and made for the showers.

Hot water washed away the sweat from my hair and skin. I let out a received groan. This type of ache was always my favorite. Knowing it came from flying and drills made me feel alive. During the war there hadn't been any time for me to just enjoy quidditch. Maybe that why when Dumbledore told me what I did here was my choice, I couldn't help but play quidditch. Perhaps after Voldemort was finally defeated, I'd join a professional team. 

I stepped out of the shower and dried myself off before changing back into my clothes. Dropping the soil town and training gear into a laundry bin, I walked back into the main locker room.

 Heat crept up my neck. Sirius, ever the immodest one, stood in front of his locker shirtless. It was clear he, too, had just showed (girls and guys have separate showers). Water dripped from his black hair down his chest. If I hadn't noticed before how fit he was, I did now. Defined muscle coiled under his tanned skin, and his trousers rode low on his hips. 

""See something you like?"" He asked with a smirk. 

""Oi! Stop corrupting little Harry, Sirius."" James said, tossing Sirius his shirt. ""Harry, shield your eyes!""

Pushing past my embarrassment, I rolled my eyes. ""It's just Sirius, James. Not much to see.""

Said boy let out a bark like laugh. ""Your blush says otherwise."" 

""I'm not blushing! I'm just hot from my shower."" I sputtered, my face burning.

He raised an eyebrow, but pulled his shirt on. I shook my head. ""James, I'm headed to dinner.""

""Hang on, I'll go with you."" He said, closing his locker. 

The two of us walked from the pitch in the twilight. It was the middle of October, and the air had a biting chill I hadn't notice while sweating from practice. I pulled my jacket a little tighter around myself.

""I heard you were having nightmares."" James said.

I shot him a sharp look. ""Doesn't everyone.""

""Sure. But most people don't wake up screaming and get hauled off by their head of house.""

""Look, James. I don't want to talk about it."" I said through clenched teeth.

He put his hand on my shoulder, stopping me in my tracks. ""Harry, you can't just keep everything inside.""

""Everything? It was one nightmare!""

He crossed his arms. ""I'm not just talking about the nightmare. You show up in the Great Hall out of the blue looking like you had just stepped out of a war. You go to say something about your past, then shut up before changing the subject. Don't give me that look, you know you do.""

""What do you want me to say?"" I exploded. All of the pent up guilt, anger and frustration poring out. ""That my parents were murdered when I was a baby? Or that a mad man has been trying to kill me since I was born because of some stupid prophecy? Or maybe you'd like to hear how everyone who gets close to me either gets hurt or dies because I'm not strong enough to save them? That their faces haunt my dreams. What do you want!"" 

By the end I was yelling, chest rising and following rapidly in anger. My eyes burned with tears that I refused to let go. James, for once, looked speechless.

""Harry, I-"" He stumbled for words. ""Is that why you have all those scars?""

My hand reached up to the lightning bolt on my forehead. I sighed, all the fight seeping out of me. ""Yes, James.""

""Shit, Harry, don't cry."" 

I hadn't realized the hot tear falling until James pulled me into his chest, at a loss of what to do other than hold me. Once I started crying, I couldn't stop. All the emotion I had fought to repress pored out, spilling onto my cheeks and James' once crisp shirt. He was warm and sturdy. Like nothing could make him move.

So this is what being held by your father felt like.

Once I started to calm down, I pulled away, rubbing at my face. James ruffled my hair with a half smile.

""James, what have I told you about making girls cry?"" Sirius called as he climbed the slop towards us.

I laughed, despite the seriousness that had surrounded us only moments before. 

""Oh, shut it."" James said, rolling his eyes. 

""Need me to hex him, Harry?"" 

""Hey! You wouldn't let him hex your brother, would you?"" James turned to me with pleading eyes.

""Well, you're not my brother, now are you?"" I told him.

James feigned hurt. ""And to think, I was going to buy you a Christmas present.""

Sirius chuckled. ""Cheeky, isn't she? Can we keep her?""

""Paws off! She's my sister."" James said, grabbing me as if to protect me from him.

""And that doesn't make me want to take her? Just think, if Harry and I got married, we could brothers by law.""

""I'm right here, you know."" I said, cheeks coloring.

""Good point."" James said, talking over my head. ""But who said I don't want Remus as a brother-in-law?""

Sirius raised an eyebrow. ""Just think of how boring their kids would be. Noses in books, studying.""

James nodded thoughtfully. ""Yes, I think your right. That settles it. You have my blessing.""

I finally manage to pull out of James arms. ""Cut it out, you two. I'm not marrying anyone.""

""Geez, you sound like Evans."" James grumbled.

I snorted. ""Then I must sound reasonable.""

""Don't be like that, Harry. She'll say yes one day, James."" Sirius said.

""Wait, you've proposed to Lily?"" I asked in great amusement.

""Only once."" James said sheepishly as we made our way into the castle. ""She said no.""

Sirius snorted. ""She used the bat bogey hex on you, and it took Remus thirty minutes to finally counter it.""

""Why so long?"" I asked.

""He was laughing too hard."" James mumbled. 

I don't think I had ever laughed so hard.

It's a full moon, and Harry asks Remus out to dinner.

It wasn't until DADA started that I realized the full moon was tomorrow. Remus sat next to James looking ill. His skin was a sickly pale color and his eyes had dark bags underneath them. 

""Listen up!"" Professor Dagel said, smiling down at everyone. She was a tall witch who seemed to closely resemble Aunt Petunia. ""With O.W.L's coming up, it's important to know about the dangerous magical creatures you may come across in every day life. If you'll all turn to page 394, we can begin our lesson on werewolves.""

I stiffened in my chair and noticed Remus had done the same. There was a great rustling noise as everyone opened their textbooks to the correct page. I quickly did the same.

""Now who can tell me the difference between a real Wolf, and a werewolf? Mr Diggory.""

""The size. Werewolves are a lot bigger."" He informed her.

""Good. Anything else? What about you, Mr Lupin.""

Remus drew his eyebrows together. He had not raised his hand, and obviously didn't want to answer. ""The snout is shorter and they have a tufted tail.

""Indeed. Now I must press how dangerous these creatures are, even when in human form-""

""Professor, werewolves might be dangerous when they transform, but not in their human form."" I said angerly. ""Their normal people.""

""Miss Potter, I can assure you that they are in fact dangerous. An attack from them as humans leads to permanent scars, and werewolf like behavior. They won't become a werewolf, bit they'll change.""

""Just how often has that happened?"" I asked expectantly.

""Well, there are only a few reported cases-"" She pressed.

""So you would condemn everyone who suffers from a illness, simply because of a few bad eggs? That's like saying everyone who has dragon pox is a murderer because one of them accidentally got someone sick.""

Irritation flash across her house like face. ""You are not a trained perfessional, Miss Potter. Your opinion doesn't matter in this classroom. It's my job to prepare you for the real world, not let you live in fantasy.""

I opened my mouth tell tell her exactly where she could shove her fantasies, but Lily put her hand on my arm and shook her head. ""Your going to get detention.""

What really made me bite my tongue was the look on Remus's face. He was curved over his desk, eyes wide, with expression I couldn't read. Surprise. Perhaps?

""Now that that's settled,"" Professor Dagel then began to explain more on the dangers of werewolves and how to kill them.

I tuned her out as I watches Remus. His expression was pained. Whether from the lecture or the pending full moon, I couldn't tell. What I wanted to do was send a well aimed jellylegs jinx at the prejudice prude who was now saying that werewolves were classified as non-human by the ministry. Lily kept her hand on my arm, squeezing when the teacher said something particularly discriminatory.

Class couldn't end faster. I shoved my textbook into my bag with more force than necessary, and left Lily in favor of joining James, Sirius, and Peter who were talking to Remus in hushed tones. 

""Don't listen to the old bat."" Peter was saying in his squeaky voice. 

They quickly stopped talking when I stopped in front of them.

""No need to ask you how you felt about the lecture."" Sirius said with an almost proud gleam in his eyes.

""I couldn't just sit there and let her spout nonsense."" I told him. I glanced at Remus, reminding myself that he didn't know I knew about his 'furry little problem'. 

""That's our Harry."" James said, wiping imaginary tears from his eyes. ""Defender of werewolves!""

""Slayer of dragons!"" Sirius chimed in dramatically.

""I mention dragons once."" I said, rolling my eyes. 

 Lily joined us a moment later. ""You're going to be late if you don't leave now, Harry. Muggle Studies is on the other side of the castle.""

""Right."" 

""Your taking Muggle Studies?"" James asked.

""Yeah, I told Dumbledore I'd take anything but divination."" I shrugged.

""Do you know any muggles?"" Peter asked, fighting with his tie.

""Oh, uh, yeah. I was raised by muggles.""

Lily looked confused. ""But your not a muggle born.""

""Half-blood. My mum was a muggle born."" I said, clearing my throat.

""Then why-"" Lily started.

James interrupted. ""Oh, look at the time! Best be off, Harry.""

I shot him a grateful smile before waving bye to the others, and starting the long trek to the seventh floor.

Muggle Studies wasn't by any means a hard corse. Especially when you lived with muggles for most of your life. The Professor was an excitable woman, who reminded me of Mr Weasley in her enthusiasm for everyday things found in muggle homes. She assigned us a foot long essay to write on our favorite muggle invention. I chose to do mine over the telephone. 

The rest of the day past quickly. Thursday morning brought frosted windows that thawed by the time the afternoon sun hit them. Remus sat across from me at the Gryffindor table, not touching his food that Peter was trying to coax him into eating. 

Peter was... not want I was expecting. He was shy, kind, and quick to offer his friends help. Since James considered me his sister, Peter made sure to try and share the sweets his mum would send him with me. It left me feeling conflicted. What happened to him that made him betray his best friends?

""I think I know what you need, Remus."" I said after a moment. He looked up, his tired eyes meeting mine. Digging through my bag, I pulled out half a chocolate bar Lily had given me.

""Here. If chocolate isn't the cure for everything, I don't know what is.""

A shadow of a smile crossed his mouth as he took the candy. I watched as he nibbled on it, but it was more than he had eaten all day. After a few minutes, he wrapped it back up, and tried to hand it back. 

""Keep it. Jenkins banned the team from candy."" I said. 

""Like it would matter if you put on weight."" Sirius said, rolling his grey eyes.

I blushed, looking down at my lean body. I wouldn't start filling out until I was sixteen. Sure, I had started to get a womanly figure. My breasts were small, but still noticeable, bit my hips were still too slim. Jenkins said I had the perfect body for a seeker, and when he saw me munching on sweets the other day, had proceed to empty my bag of all the candy he could find.

""You can't afford to get fat and lazy."" He had said.

Little did he know of the stash Lily had given me that sat in my dorm. It wouldn't matter if I only ate junk all day. I never seemed to weigh more than 115 pounds. 

Remus pocketed the chocolate. ""I'll get you some on the trip to Hogsmead.""

""Don't worry about it."" I waved him off. ""I'm just glad you ate something.""

His cheeks colored slightly. 

I spent most of the day watching Remus. As the day more on, his skin took on a sweaty sheen. He looked exhausted with his shoulders slumped.

""Remus!"" I called, trying to catch up with him in the over crowded hall.

He paused, looking like he was one blow of wind away from falling over. ""Hey, Harry. Looking for James?""

""For you, actually."" I told him, falling into step. ""Listen, I was wondering if maybe you'd like to dinner with me?""

He raised a tired eyebrow at me in an amused sort of way. ""I thought you were engaged to Sirius.""

""Engaged? What?"" I drew my eyebrows together. Then it hit me. ""Merlin's beard, James. I'm not engaged to anyone, Remus. Why would that matter?"" Then- ""Oh. No, I... I wasn't asking... I mean... Bloody hell.""

Remus cracked a smile. ""Harry, I was messing with you.""

""Er, right. So, dinner?"" I mumbled, trying to control the blush that threatened to cover my face. ""I figured we could go down to the kitchens a bit early since it's a fu-"" I cut myself off. I had almost given away that I knew about him being a werewolf. ""I mean, since you don't feel well.""

""Sure. That sounds nice, actually."" 

""Great. Shall we?"" I asked, gesturing for him to lead the way.

We walked down the stairs, waiting for the to rearrange themselves, before making our way down to the dungeons. I stretched onto my tiptoes and tickled the pear. 

Immediately we were swarmed by house elves eager to serve. ""Messer Remus!"" one squeezed in excitement. ""What can Blinky be getting for you, sir?""

""Hi, Blinky. Just some pumpkin juice, please."" Remus said kindly.

The elf scurried away and another elf (Nobly) pressed me for what I'd like. ""Surprise me.""

Remus and I took a seat at the replica Gryffindor table. ""How'd you know how to get into the kitchens?"" Remus asked.

""I, uh, read about it.""

""You read about it? What book?""

I fidgeted in my seat across from him. ""How are you feeling?""

He sighed but let it go. ""Tired. I'll be fine.""

The house elves brought Remus his pumpkin juice, and set a plate of fruit in front of me. We sat in strained silence. Each knowing the other was hiding something, but not wanting to pry. I managed to convince Remus to eat a little bit of fruit, but he took little more than a bite. 

Sometime later we walked into the common room where James, Sirius, and Peter stood waiting.

""Remus!"" Sirius said when he spotted us. ""Where were you? I checked to hospital wing, but Poppy said you hadn't been to see her.""

""I'm fine. Harry and I were in the kitchens."" Remus said in a strained sort of way.

""You and Harry?"" James asked. 

""Relax, James. I knew Remus wasn't feeling well, so we went to the kitchens instead of the Great Hall."" I told him.

""I was worried."" Peter said softly. 

I scrunched my eyebrows together, unsure of what to make of it. Peter was so nice, nothing like I had imagined he would be like. Lily joined us a few minutes later before dragging me behind her and up to the dorms. I had to make sure Remus would be okay tonight. So when everyone fell asleep and the moon was high, I donned my invisibility cloak, and slipped out into the brisk night air.

Hey, everyone. So, I just posted chapter nine, check out out if you haven't already. I think it would be productive as a writer to ask everyone what the like most about this story, what they don't like, and open the floor to any questions you might have. 

I really have tried hard to make the characters as true to themselves as I possibly can, so I apologize if they come of as ooc. 

I have a unique (at least I hope it is) vision for this story, so thank you to everyone who has stuck with it so far. 

Again, please feel free to ask any questions you may have. I'll try my best to answer them without giving too much away.

Thank you,

Reagan.

Harry meets a werewolf and Remus is confused.

It was relaxing to be under my invisibility cloak again. Though, sneaking though the corridors without the map was indeed strange. Now I had to rely on my hearing to make sure no patrolling professors, prefects, or Mr. Filtch and his cat were around the corner. I held my breath as a castle ghost floated by. If they were aware of my presence, they didn't let on. 

The full moon was high in the night sky by the time I made it out of the castle. I shivered in the cold night air wishing I had thought to bring a jacket. The grounds were still as I made my way toward the twitchy whomping willow. 

Although logically I knew Remus would be fine, after all he wouldn't die until 1998, I still had to make sure with my own eyes. What if tonight is the night he gets the long scar that crosses his face? What if James, Sirius, and Peter hadn't figured out how to become animagi yet? The though of leaving Remus to face his transformation alone without his friends of the help of a wolfsbane potion made me feel sick.

But what exactly was I going to do? I wasn't an animagus. The only time I had ever seen a werewolf transform was in my third year, and it had almost gotten me killed. Remus was a good person, but he would still be dangerous tonight. 

I shook my head at my sudden fear. If I could hunt down horicruxs, ride a dragon out of Gringotts, and battle Death Eaters, I could find a way to help Remus tonight. With a well aimed jab at the nob on the tree, it froze and I crawled through the hole at the base of the trunk. 

The earth was damp beneath my hands. It was with great difficulty that I made my why through the narrow tunnel whilst still covered by my invisibility cloak. I didn't, after all, want Remus or anyone else that might be at the end of the tunnel to see me. That would bring questions I couldn't answer.

A few minutes past before I began to see a glowing light at the end of the tunnel. A sharp pain filled cry cut though the air. I moved faster, no longer caring that I might emerge to find a fully grown werewolf on the other side. 

I burst through the exit, cloak slipping off. Remus was hunched over on all fours, trembling from head to toe. He through his head back in a silent scream as a loud crack! filled the room.

""Ha...Harry?"" He spotted me as I moved to kneel next to him. ""What...?""

""Shh."" I put my hand on his back. ""We can talk later.""

He tried to move away from me, but another spasm racked his body. ""Agh! You... you can't be here... Ugh! It's not safe.""

I rubbed his back, remembering that Tonks had once said it was soothing for him when he was transforming. Because she was a metamorphagus, she could turn herself into an animal to keep him company.

""I'll be fine.""

Remus leaned into my touch after a particularly bad bought of his bones breaking and reshaping themselves. I found myself filling the silence with soothing nonsense. I wasn't sure if this was for him or me. 

Fur began to sprout along his back as his fingers became claws. I ignored the panic that began to creep up my spine. I still had no idea what I was going to do when he fully transformed. The cries of pain morphed into growls and whines. This seemed to go on for hours. I could feel his bones snapping under my hands and shuddered. Remus suddenly began to claw at the skin on his face.

I grabbed his wrists, only knowing that I needed to keep him from hurting himself more. His claws tore at the sensitive skin of my hand, but I didn't let go. Not when he needed me. Blood began to trickle down my arm, pooling at my elbow. 

I'd had worse.

It wasn't until his arms resembled front legs that I released him. Taking my wand out of my pocket, I gripped it tightly and stepped away. 

Remus was gone, and in his place lay the biggest wold I had ever seen.

It's fur was long and brown. It looked soft and inviting. The complete opposite of what I found in the wolf's snarling face. It growled, staggering to its feet.

""Imobulus!"" I yelled, pointed my wand at it. 

Anger and hatred shone up at me from Remus' eyes and he lay frozen on the shack floor. My body shook violently as I lowered my wand but kept it handy. Somehow this was worse than facing an army of Death Eaters. No doubt because it was a friend.

Not turning my back on him, I moved to one of the few chairs that hadn't been destroyed and sat down.  

Time past slowly. I had no idea what I was going to say to Remus in the morning that would explain how I knew where he was or that he was a werewolf. Telling him the truth wasn't an option. I still didn't know what kind of effect my presence would have on the future. Despite what Dumbledore said, I couldn't help but wonder in my being in this time wasn't going to rip apart the future.

 

Harry worries, and so does Sirius.

Not quite the way I wanted it, but oh well.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

When Remus began to transform again, I sat still in the chair. It wasn't until his paws were hands that I knelt beside him once more and rubbed my uninjured hand across his back. It had been a long night. As a werewolf, Remus had continuously snarled at me from his petrified state. It seemed turning back into a human was quicker that becoming a wolf.

I grabbed the blanket Madame Pomfrey had left and draped it over Remus to give him some sense of modesty. He lay shaking on the ground. Looking up at me with tired eyes, Remus blinked hard.

""Your real.""

I offered a slight smile. "" I should think so.""

""Did... I hurt you?""

""I'm fine, Remus.""

He closed his eyes, seemingly content with this answer, and drifted off to sleep. A new cut ran from the corner of his mouth down his chin, one that I couldn't remember him ever getting. Leaning forward, I pressed my palms into my eyes and cried silently.

It had been terrifying to watch and made worse still because there was nothing I could do to stop it. I couldn't save Sirius, or Dumbledore, or Cedric. Everyone died. My parents, Fred, Tanks, Remus, Colin, and Denies. The list went on and on. Now I was stuck twenty-three years in the past with no way to return to the war.

Some chosen one I was. 

It wasn't until I heard someone coming down the tunnel that I noticed how light it had become. I lept to my feet and slipped on my cloak just as Madam Pomfrey stepped into the shack. As she woke Remus, I went through the tunnel and snuck back up to Gryffindor tower. My dorm was still quiet when I arrived. There was still an hour before I would go down to breakfast then to the quidditch pitch for practice. Once my cloak was folded and safely in the bottom of my trunk, I stretched out on my bed.

Sleep didn't come. Too many thoughts raced around my mind. What was I going to tell Remus? I couldn't tell him I was from the future. That would create more problems than it solved, not to mention he would think I was crazy. I could pretend to have figured it out, but that wouldn't explain how I knew he was in the Shrieking Shack, or how I knew about the tunnel. Would he tell James, Sirius, and Peter that I had been there? I groaned in frustration. I needed to figure out what I was going to tell him quickly. 

The other girls began to stir, so I took that as my cue to get up. Lily smiled at me from where she stood at her trunk, before her eyes went wide.

""Harry, what happened? Why are you covered in dirt?"" Her voice was thick with worry.

It took me a moment to realize she was talking about my arm that was still covered in dry blood. I looked down at it for the first time. The cut along my arm was deeper than I had thought and ran from my palm down to curve around my wrist. 

""I- I must have been sleep walking."" I said lamely. 

""Fully dressed?"" She snatched my arm to inspect the damage. 

""I didn't change into my pj's last night.""

She dragged me to the bathroom where she gently wiped away the dried bold and dirt from my arm. She worked in silence, a crease between her eyebrows appeared as she worried over it with soft hands. A pang of longing filled my chest and I could almost see myself as a child getting my scraped knee tended to by her. After it was cleaned, Lily conjured some gauze before wrapping it. When she was done, I quickly changed and made to leave. I did, after all, need to eat something before practice, and told Lily as much when she scolded me for trying to run off.

""You need to tell Jenkins you can't practice today, not with your wrist like that."" Lily said.

""Really, it's fine."" I insisted. ""I've had much worse.""

This was the wrong thing to say.

""Worse?! How much worse?""

""I once had every bone in my arm vanished."" This seemed the safest thing to say.

She gaped at me. ""Every bone... Bloody hell, Harry. Fine. If you want to get a scar because you rip it open, be my guest.""

I sighed and took my leave. My hand now looked far worse with all the white wrapping going from my hand down to my forearm. But if it made Lily feel better, I'd leave it be. It was nice having her fuss over me. My breakfast had to be scarfed down before I sprinted to the locker room. I was changing into my quidditch robes while Jenkins explained to training plan for that day. James shot worried looks in my direction when he saw the bandages which I chose to ignore in favor of collecting my broom and marching onto the field with the rest of the team.

Jenkins seemed intent on making me do flying drills. He wanted me to push my broom as fast as it would go. I leaned flat against the handle as I performed the quick maneuvers when they were called out. The cut burned, and I knew I had ripped it open again just like Lily had said I would. Not that I would tell her that. It was freeing to concentrate solely on the sharp turns and sudden dives. It pushed everything from my mind, as if the wind was stealing the thoughts from my head. 

""Finally, Potter!"" Jenkins yelled. ""Now we're getting somewhere.""

I rolled my eyes. If Jenkins had seen me in my fourth year out fly a dragon, he still wouldn't be pleased. The rest of practice flew by, and before I knew it I was stepping out of a steaming shower. I hissed in pain when I bent my wrist to pull on my trousers. It had grown an angry red and was swollen from overuse  The skin around it was hot with fever. Putting the soiled bandages in the rubbish, I went back into the locker rooms. James and Sirius sat waiting for me. James looked up at me in concern. Sirius, on the other hand, seemed to be in a rather foul mood.

I hesitated slightly. ""Hey.""

Sirius crossed his arms and scoffed. 

James sighed. ""You really shouldn't have practiced today, Harry.""

I grew defensive. ""Why not?""

""Oh, I don't know."" Sirius said in a mocking tone. ""Maybe because you're injured?""

""Hardly. It's just a scratch."" I said in annoyance.

He pushed off the bench, towing over me and jerking my arm up from my side. I yelped at the sudden movement. Sirius scanned over the angry looking gash, shaking his head in anger. ""Go see Pomfrey."" He let go and took a step back.

I clenched my jaw. ""I said I'm fine."" 

""Fine?"" He demanded. ""Evans stopped just stopped by and told us you'd gotten up this morning covered in dirt and blood. But, oh, you're fine.""

""Because I am!"" My voice rose in anger. ""Why the bloody hell should you care, Black? You don't know me!""

His grey eyes turned to steel. ""So I'm not suppose to care when you scare everyone around you, including my best friend because you're too selfish to ask for help?!"" He sneered. ""You know what? Fine. Give yourself another scar.""

""Sirius."" James said in warning.

I went rigid as an anger like I had never felt before filled my body. My palm cracked across his cheek. ""How dare you, Sirius Black.""

Moving past them both, I marched away as the first tear fell. it wasn't until I bumped into someone that I realized I was back in the castle.

""Harry?"" Remus asked as he peered down at me with tired eyes.

Whatcha think?

Harry and Remus grow closer.

I AM SO SORRY!!!!! this update took forever. I knew what I wanted to do, just not how I wanted it to happen. I'm not too happy with this one, but it gets the point across.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

I looked up at Remus. He looked worn out but better than he had been in the past few days. Clearing my throat, I willed myself to calm down. 

""Hey, Remus.""

His eyebrows drew together in concern. ""What's wrong?""

""Nothing. How are you feeling?"" I asked, changing the subject and willing my tears to stop.

""Better. Listen, Harry. I know something's wrong. I might not know much about you, but I do know you're not one cry without cause."" His eyes were filled with that concern I knew so well.

Despite how hurt I was by Sirius and his harsh words, I laughed slightly. Remus was still the same. So very caring for others even when most would have been blinded by their own problems. Here was Remus, more concerned over my tears than how I knew he was a werewolf. It was in this moment that I made a decision that would doubtlessly change the course of history. I was going to tell Remus where, or more accurately when, I came from. There was no way I could tell him everything, not if I was still planning to go back. But would staying be so terrible? I would have Lily, and James, and Sirius, and Remus, and Dumbledore, and countless others who had died because of me. In choosing to stay, I would also be giving up everything I had ever known. Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, and everyone else who had come to count on me. Was I willing to leave that all behind for a chance to change the horrors of the past?

""Alright, Remus. Why don't we go somewhere we can talk? I know a place."" I said, holding out my hand to him.

He looked from my hand to my face. Curiosity curled in his eyes. Remus took my hand and allowed me to lead him upstairs. As we walked I couldn't help but wonder if he knew about the Room of Requirement yet, or if he had ever found it. Once in the seventh floor corridor, I let go of Remus and began to summon the room. 'I need a place to talk. I need a place to talk.' 

""Um, Harry?""

""Yeah?""

""What exactly are you doing? I thought-""

""Here we go.""

A door began to carve itself out of the wall. The look on Remus' face told me he hadn't found where the Room of Requirement was. 

""How'd-?""

I hesitated. ""It's a long story.""

As he stepped into the room, he said, ""I've got loads of time.""

I couldn't help the smile that crossed my face when I saw what form the secret room had taken. It was an exact replica of the DADA office from the days Remus held the position. Everything was just as it had been, from the books on defence to the empty grindylow cage in the corner. It was bittersweet. We took a seat next to the fireplace where Remus looked at me expectantly. My heart beat rapidly in my chest. What I was about to tell him couldn't be taken back. Out of everyone I could tell, I knew Remus was the best. Just like Hermione, there was no doubt he'd unearth the truth sooner or later. Instead of fighting that, I would be creating an inexhaustible source of help. But where to begin? 

""Right."" I cleared my throat. ""There are somethings I can't tell you, but I will try my best to be honest with you. What I'm about to tell you must stay between us. Do I have your word?""

Remus studied me for a moment before nodding slowly. A breathe I didn't know I was holding pushed past my lips. If there was one person I could trust, it was him. ""Thank you."" Another moment passed as I struggled to find the right words. ""I was born July 31, 1980. My parents are Lily and James Potter."" My eyes were glued to Remus, watching for any reaction. If these words were a shock, he didn't show it. Remus kept his expression schooled perfectly.

""On October 31, 1981, Voldemort murdered them and tried to kill me. That's how I got this."" I pushed my hair off my forehead, exposing my scar. ""That night, Voldemort was defeated for the first time and I was sent to live with Lily's sister, Petunia.""

Remus scrunched up his eyebrows. ""James and Lily... murdered?""

I looked at my folded hands in my lap. ""I know it's a lot to take in. I'm sorry.""

""But where was I? Or Sirius and Peter? Why wouldn't we have taken you? There's no way we would have let you go to Petunia.""

My throat tightened. ""I know, but I can't tell you.""

He sighed. ""Alright. Please, continue.""

""The first time I can remember meeting you, was my third year at Hogwarts. You were my Defence Against The Dark Arts professor, and the most brilliant we ever had. This is when I learned you were a werewolf, and how I know about the Shrieking Shack. I met Sirius and Peter then, too. The next year, Voldemort came back."" I hesitated. Telling Remus about James and Lily was a must, but Sirius? Was that really vital for him to know?

""Sirius died in my fifth year protecting me. War broke out, and by my seventh year I was on the run. May, 1998, I snuck back into Hogwarts. A battle began as Voldemort attacked the school to try and get to me."" My voice wavered slightly. ""You died. So many people died. Voldemort gave me a choice. Go to him and die, or continue to let others die for me. The choice was easy. When I died, I was somehow transported back in time. I woke up in the Forbidden Forest, fifteen again. The rest you know.""

Remus was silent for a long time, taking in everything I had said. It had to of been a lot to take in. I lived it and it was still difficult for me to wrap my head around. My heartbeat pounded in my ears as I waited for him to say something, anything. 

Then, ""Is that why you were crying?""

I blinked, having completely forgotten about it. ""Er, yes and no. Lily told James and Sirius about the cut on my arm. They weren't pleased that I had gone to practice like that, and Sirius lashed out at me.""

Remus' eyes went wide. ""Cut? Did I...?""

Damnit. ""It's really no big deal. Just a scratch.""

""I scratched you?"" His face went pale.

""Oh, no! I mean yes, but you hadn't even transformed yet. I would have had Madame Pomphrey heal it, but you can't magically heal wound caused by a werewolf. Honestly, Remus, I'm alright."" After a moment, ""Is that really what you're worried about? Even after everything I just told you?""

""Yes, I'm bloody worried about it! I could have seriously hurt you! Then where would we be?"" He demanded.

""Hold on. You-you believe me?"" I asked, hope filling my chest.

His eyes softened. ""I believe you, Harry. It explains loads, to be honest. Like how you and James look so much alike, your first appearance in the Great Hall. Even how you seem to know where everything is when you couldn't have known.""

""Well. That was, uh, easy. I thought it would take a lot more to convince you."" I admitted.

""I trust you."" He smiled briefly before turning serious. ""Now, what are we going to do?""

I raised an eyebrow. ""About what?""

""You."" He said simply. ""Since you only told me pieces of the future, I'm assuming there's a few things you can't tell me either because you're going back to your own time, or my reaction could start a chain of events that would upset any future you set in motion.""

I sighed. ""I have no idea what I'm going to do. What do you think I should do?""

""First things first. We need to tell Peter, James, and Sirius-"" When I opened my mouth, Remus held up his hand. ""-that you know I'm a werewolf. That way Sirius will apologize for whatever it is he said to you, and there's no reason to complicate your situation any more than it already is by having him jump to wild conclusions about you.""

""But how do we explain how I knew?""

""Simple."" He shrugged. ""You overheard me and Madame Pomphrey when you went to pick up a sleeping draught. They already know you have nightmares, so they shouldn't have any problems believing it. As for the cut, tell them the truth. That you were worried and followed me to make sure I was okay, and you got scratched helping me.""

I sat there slightly stunned. ""You don't do things halfway, do you, Moony?""

He raised an eyebrow. ""Moony?""

""They haven't given you that nickname yet?""

""No, I can't say they have.""

I grinned. ""They will. In fact, you each have your own nickname.""

""I'm not sure I like 'Moony'.""

""It'll grow on you."" I promised.

Whatcha think? Let me know in the comment section below. Long reviews are love, and motivate my lazy ass! Just sayin.

Sirius is sorry, and Peter is human.

Hey everyone. This chapter is a filler and super short but necessary.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

As Remus and I joined the flow of students headed to dinner, I found myself filled with hope for the first time in a long time. We had talked for a long time about nothing, and missed lunch. For the first time since I arrived here, I didn't have to watch what I said. Remus asked me questions about my everyday life before the world had gone crazy, and I could tell him. I told him about Ron and Hermione. How Ron always seemed to be eating and Hermione was never far from a book. He listened as I talked about how I missed flying on my firebolt, and that maybe then Jenkins would finally be satisfied with my flying abilities. It was fantastic being able to speak without guilt twisting in my gut.

""By the way, Harry,"" Remus began as we dodged a pair of first years running past. ""You never told me how you found the Room Of Requirement.""

""Oh, well, in my fifth year the ministry was interfering at Hogwarts. They sent Dolores Umbridge, a ministry official, to fill the Defence position, spy on Dumbledore, and paint me as a lunatic."" I laughed bitterly. ""When Umbridge told us there would be no practical lessons or wand work because we had nothing to fear, I disagreed. That's how I got this.""

I held out my hand. Remus looked over the scar with dark eyes. ""She carved that into your hand?"" His voice held the same growl it had when he saw it in 1995.

I shook my head. ""No, she made me do it."" At his disbelieving look, I explained further. ""She had this quill. When you write with it, it uses your blood and carves the words into your hand. Normally it wouldn't get this bad, but I got detention with here more times than I could count. Anyway, when she refused to teach us, Ron and Hermione convinced me to do it in secret, and that's how we found the room.""

""You taught your classmates Defence?"" Remus looked impressed.

I shrugged as we made it to the first floor. ""Anything from defencive spells to a patronus.""

""Wait."" He stopped walking to turn to me fully. ""You can cast a patronus?""

I smiled up at him. ""Of course. I had a great teacher; you.""

He shook his head smiling and continued to walk towards the Great Hall. Sirius, James, and Peter were already seated at the Gryffindor table. When I sat down across from Sirius, he disregarded me with a cold sneer before turning to Remus. I pushed down the anger and guilt in favor of loading my plate.

""Where have you been all day, Remus? I tried to find you earlier. Madam Pomphrey said you left just before lunch."" Sirius said.

""I was with Harry."" Remus said coolly. He looked at me before continuing. ""We discussed my furry little problem.""

The three boys across from us gaped with their jaws hanging slack. 

""You mean-"" James sputtered.

""She knows?"" Sirius demanded in shock.

I cleared my throat. ""Yesterday when I went to the Hospital Wing to get a Dreamless Draught, I overheard Remus and Madam Pomphrey talking. I couldn't stand the thought of him transforming alone, so I followed them.""

""Is that how you...?"" James asked.

I nodded, anxious. ""He was tearing at his skin, so I grabbed his hands. I won't have any, uh, side effects but I can't heal it with magic, either. That's why I didn't go to Pomphrey.""

""You weren't scared?"" Peter asked in slight awe.

""Remus is my friend, and that's worth more to me than fear. I know it was reckless, but I couldn't let him be alone."" I told him honestly.

Sirius had a hard look in his eyes. ""So you just decided to spend the night with him knowing the risk? I-"" He stopped short, taking a deep breathe. ""I'm sorry.""

I blinked. ""You're not mad?""

""How can I be? You knew the risk and still decided to go. Then I had to go and make an ass out of myself, not even stopping to consider that you would go so far for someone you barely knew. I shouldn't have said what I did."" His eyebrows were drawn together in shame. ""I'll make it up to you."" He finished, determined.

""There's really no need.""

""Don't tell him that, Harry."" James said with a grin. ""It's so rare we get to see Sirius admit he was an ass and try and make amends."" 

""Well, we are betrothed. It wouldn't do for me to squander this chance to show Harry that making up is always the best part."" Sirius said with a wink.

Remus choked on the sip of pumpkin juice he had just taken at the expression on James' face. 

""You won't be showing my sweet little Harry anything, betrothed or otherwise!"" James said heatedly.

My cheeks set fire. ""Cut it out, you two.""

""Yeah, James."" Sirius smirked. ""Butt out of our love life.""

""The only love in your life is your hair, Black."" Lily said as she plopped down next to me. I laughed at the putout expression on his face. It was a relief that Sirius was no longer angry with me. I could tell that Lily was still less than pleased with me, but her way of showing it was far different than what Sirius had done. 

""Where were you all day, Harry?"" Lily asked.

""Library with Remus."" I told her, shoveling a spoonful of stew to my mouth. 

""Really?"" She frowned. ""I didn't see either of you.""

""Madam Pince asked me to shelf books in the restricted section, and Harry offered to help."" Remus covered easily.

She seemed satisfied enough with his answer because she let it go. The rest of dinner past with pleasant conversation and plenty of laughs. It amazed me how funny Peter was. He was quick with a joke and a boyish grin. This was so different from the image of him I had created in my mind. There were no signs of the traitor he would become, no hints at the murderer he would be. Peter was nice, caring, shy, and most of all, he was becoming human in my eyes. I found myself enjoying his company despite all the pain he would one day bring to everyone he called a friend.

Whatcha think?

Lily has trouble with a spell and Sirius is a player.

Hey, everyone. So, I'm playing around with the idea of Harry growing more comfortable in the Marauders Era. Tell me whatcha think!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Lily, Severus, and I joined the crowd of students hurrying to their next class. Transfiguration had never been one of my strong suits, but having taken this course before, I found it to be relatively easy. Lily and Severus were discussing the newest spell the class was learning; vanishing.

""I just can't seem to get the mouse's tail to disappear."" Lily complained. 

""I had the same problem."" I told her around a mouthful of chocolate. ""You're adding an extra flourish to your wand movements.""

""You didn't have that problem."" Severus sneered. ""Your mouse vanished on the first attempt.""

I shrugged easily. ""I learned that spell a few years ago. Want some?"" I offered him a piece of candy to which he promptly curled his lip at.

The classroom was almost full by the time we reached it. The three of us sat near the front, chatting about wand movements. I quickly stuffed the chocolate back into my bag when Jenkins poked his head into the room with narrowed eyes.

""Potter."" He said. ""Hand it over.""

I put on my most innocent smile. ""Hand what over, Captain?""

""That chocolate you hid in your bag."" He stepped up to my desk, palm held out expectantly.

""You took it all, remember?""

He rolled his eyes. ""Apparently I didn't. You can't afford to get fat and lazy, not with our first match being less than a month away.""

Grumbling under my breath I passed over the half eaten candy bar. With a satisfied nod, Jenkins left to join his fellow seventh years in his next class. I watched him go before pulling a bag of jelly slugs out of my bag. Lily shook her head at me with an amused smile. Severus rolled his eyes and turned his eyes to the front where Professor McGonagall stood.

""Today we will be picking up from where we left off yesterday. Miss Potter, if you would pass out the mice."" She said.

I stood and grabbed the box off her desk. A few girls eyes the mice with disgust when I carefully set one on each desk. Remus smiled and nodded with thanks. Peter pet his mouse and said thanks. James and Sirius, however-

""Distributer of mice!"" James proclaimed.

""Handler of rodents!"" Sirius exclaimed.

""Har har."" I said, rolling my eyes before moving back to my desk with the last mouse.

With ease, I waved my wand and the mouse vanished and turned to watch Lily attempt to do the same. The small animal moved around the desk, sniffing at the edge before moving on. Lily tried to make it disappear for several minutes, but to no avail. She huffed in frustration as only the legs disappeared, and the mouse began to roll around the desk top with panicked squeaks. 

""Oh, shut it."" She grumbled when I snicker.

""Your being too forceful. Make you movements more fluid."" I suggested. 

Lily relaxed her wand arm and tried again. ""Nothings happening.""

""Try it again, and picture what you want to happen. What were you thinking when it's legs disappeared?"" I asked.

""That I wish the bloody thing would stay still."" 

""Well,"" I said slowly. ""Your magic is responding to what you want. In that moment, you wanted the mouse to be still and it's legs disappeared. You have to want it to disappear completely, and your magic will respond accordingly.""

""When did you become an expert in magical control, Potter?"" Severus asked with a raised eyebrow.

""You caught me."" I sighed dramatically. ""I'm a magic whisperer.""

He shook his head. I had to admit, I enjoyed teenage Severus far more than adult him. He was easy to talk to, and I could tell I was growing on him. When I told him this, he said-

""Yes, like a fungus.""

I shrugged. ""At least I'm useful in potions.""

Lily ignored us in favor of trying again. A small line appeared between her eyebrows. This time when she waved her wand, the mouse vanished completely. ""I did it! Sev, I did it!""

Severs looked over, having just successfully vanished his own mouse. ""Well done, Lily.""

 

I sat in my favorite overstuffed armchair in the common room. My quill scratched away on the thick parchment. 


Mrs Potter,



My sincerest thanks for the broom you sent. I apologize for the delayed reply. James had suggested that I write a personal response, and I find that I'm a bit rusty on writing letters. It would be my pleasure to know you, as James and Sirius often sing your praises.



Hariah Potter


I read over the letter before deciding it was good as it was ever going to get.

""Going somewhere?"" Remus asked pleasantly. 

""The Owlery. I'm sending a letter to Mrs. Potter.""

He closed his book a stood. ""I'll come with you.""

I smiled brightly. Remus and I had grown closer in the past several days since I had told him the truth about who I was. Everything felt easier to handle, and I was in a far better mood. It was amazing the difference one person could make. As we made our way to the tower, we talked about the upcoming Hogsmeade weekend.

""I'm actually not sure if I can go."" I said, frowning.

""What do you mean?"" Remus asked.

""I don't have anyone to sign a permission slip for me. Would I even need one? I am, after all, seventeen in my time.""

Remus looked thoughtful. ""I'm sure Dumbledore has everything taken care of. After all, he knows the truth so I wouldn't worry too much about it.""

The Owlery was just as I remembered it; dropping coating the floor and hundreds of owls swooping in and out of the open windows. I selected a school screech owl who held his leg out expectantly and with an air of importance about him. 

""Euphemia Potter, Potter Manor, please."" 

I watched it take off and fly over the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest. A twinge of sadness pulled at me as I was reminded of Hedwig taking my letters to Sirius when he was in hiding. She had been one of my first friends, and helped me threw most summer holidays with the Durselys. Remus and I started back towards Gryffindor Tower as the last bit of light disappeared from view.

""What are somethings to look forward to in the coming years?"" Remus asked.

I thought for a moment. ""Well, lets see. The Weird Sisters. They're a really great band that Tonks can't get enough of.""

""Who's Tonks?"" 

""Oh, she... You know what? You will have to find that out on your own. I don't want to spoil the surprise-""

Remus and I had just turned the corner to an abandoned corridor when I stopped short. There was Sirius, snogging heatedly with a blonde Hufflepuff whom I believed to be a year ahead of us. He had her pressed against the wall with her legs wrapped around his waist, and fingers tangled in his dark hair. I felt my face grow red at seeing such a private moment. Remus cleared his throat next to me, and the spell over the two broke. Sirius pulled away and looked over at us. The poor girl seemed to be as red as I felt, and untangled herself before walking quickly away and straightening her clothes.

""Hey Remus, Harry."" Sirius said coolly as if we hadn't just walked up on him snogging some girl senseless. 

""It's a bit close to curfew, don't you think?"" Remus asked in obvious amusement as though this were a common occurrence, which it probably was.

""S'all part of the thrill. What are you two doing?""

""Harry had a letter to send, so I showed her where the Owlery was."" He replied easily.

Sirius turned his grey eyes on me. I couldn't help but notice that his lips were pink and slightly swollen, and that messy hair had never suited anyone better. His lips curled into a smile. ""Not writing to a boy, are you?""

My cheeks grew hot once more. ""Not that it's any of your business, but I was writing to Mrs. Potter.""

Sirius joined as as we began to walk and slung his arm over my shoulders. ""Good. I'm not one to share.""

I shrugged him arm off and rolled my eyes. ""Oh, bugger off.""

Sirius let out a bark like laugh, and I couldn't help the small smile that formed at the sound of it.

Yes! Sirius finally gets to show off his skill with the ladies. I think it's about time we begin to develop the relationship between those two. Notice I said develop. We still have a ways to go before we get to anything juicy. Harry has to grow a bit more as a person, and so does Sirius, before they can get together.If anyone has any ideas they would like to share, I would love to hear them. No promises that I will use them, but they help to get the creative juices flowing.So, whatcha think? Let me know in the comment section down below.

Hey everyone. So, I go my first negative review today and was honestly a bit shocked. After receiving so much praise on this story, it was very disheartening to read that someone, somewhere, thought my story was, quote, ""shit"". I have decided to leave the comment up as a reminder that not everyone is going to find my writing to be something they enjoy, and that's okay. 

Let me clear up a few things.

Sorry if this AN seems a bit out of the blue, I was honestly not expecting to write it. I was going to simply acknowledge the negative feedback with a reply to the comment, but I'm on my monthlies and feeling a bit emotional right now. I also cannot believe I just told you all that... Anyway, Thank you for your love and support. 

Reagan

Hogsmeade and parents.

This chapter is dedicated to those who take the time to comment. You will never know how much that means to me.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

To say James was excited about the Hogsmeade trip would be an understatement. He insisted that he be the one to show me around and for once, Lily agreed with him. Most of the evening before was spent with him, Sirius, Peter, Remus, and Lily deciding what James and I would be doing first.

""Zonko's first."" Sirius said.

James nodded in agreement. ""Definitely.""

""What?"" Peter shook his head mournfully. ""Honeydukes! Harry's going to run out of her candy stash with Jenkins taking up more everyday.""

I laughed, slightly surprised that Peter had noticed my dwindling supply of sweets. Jenkins had recently taken to surprise inspections to empty my bag of anything he deemed unhealthy. ""Bloke just doesn't want to by his own.""

""Right."" James said mournfully. ""Honeydukes, then Zonko's. Good call, Pete.""

""We'll all be meeting for lunch at the Three Broomsticks, right?"" Lily asked as she braided random strands of her vivid red hair.

""Right."" Remus confirmed. 

It was almost surreal to be planning a day with my dad, lunch with my mum, godfather, Remus, and Peter. A light atmosphere had settled around me the past few days. I felt normal for the first time in my life. I wasn't the girl-who-lived, the chosen one, undesirable no. one. I was just Harry. This new found freedom was intoxicating. After the wild speculation of my arrival died down, no really spared me a second glance. I was just another face in the crowd. It was brilliant.

""What should she wear?"" Lily asked James. I smiled to myself, imagining a similar situation where the two were married with a new baby.

James looked thoughtful. ""Something nice. Dressy but casual.""

""What about that sweaterdress?"" Sirius suggested. ""It'll hide the fact that she has small breasts.""

My face grew hot. ""Sirius! You can't just talk about my-""

Sirius placed what was meant to be a comforting hand on my shoulder. ""Don't worry love, they'll grow.""

My mouth opened and shut in silent mortification. Lily was the first to jump to my defence with a roll of her eyes. ""You're such a dog, Black.""

""Honesty is the first step to a lasting relationship, Evens. That's why you and James are struggling."" Sirius told her solemnly. 

""Hey! I'm honest to Evens."" James claimed.

""Potter and I are not in a relationship!"" Lily sputtered. ""As if I would ever go out with someone who's ego could fill this room.""

Remus and I shared a private smile at their expense.

 

The following morning saw Lily impatiently trying to tidy my hair. Much to her displeasure, it didn't matter what she tried. My curls simply refused to be tamed by any of the charms she tried. I found myself growing steadily more amused at the creative profanity she grumbled under her breath. After nearly an hour she finally threw her hands up in frustration, and telling me my hair can ""do whatever the bloody hell it wants!"". The sweater dress she had me put on looked nice paired with the black leggings and grey boots she had chosen. I hated to admit it, but Sirius was right. The dress gave me the illusion of a figure I wouldn't get until next year. 

""Right. Since you won't let me do your makeup-"" Lily said.

""It's just Hogsmeade.""

""-you're as ready as you'll ever be."" She finished as if I hadn't said anything. 

Together, to two us us made our way to the Great Hall where the boys had already started eating. Lily waved goodbye as she went to join some of the other girls from our year. I plopped down between Peter and Remus and across from James and Sirius. it wasn't much longer before my plate was loaded and I tucked it. Sirius shook his head in disbelief as the food steadily disappeared off my plate.

""I can't say I've ever met a girl who eats quite like you, Harry."" He said with a slight smile.

I swallowed my mouthful of eggs. ""You should never let good food go to waste. It's simply criminal.""

""Here, here!"" James lifted his goblet of pumpkin juice in agreement.

""Are you excited to go to Hogsmeade, Harry?"" Peter asked as crumbs from the biscuit he was eating tumbled down the front of his shirt.

I nodded, taking a sip of juice. ""Honestly, I just can't wait to restock at Honeydukes. I ran out of jumping snakes yesterday.""

""You opened that bag yesterday."" Remus laughed.

I grinned sheepishly. ""Jenkins found me eating them in the hall, so I shoved as many as I could in my mouth before he took the rest away.""

""I'm just surprised he didn't try to make you spit them out."" Sirius admitted.

I snorted. ""He can try.""

The boys shook their heads with matching grins. Peter pat my arm affectionately like he would a sister. I found that the more time I spent with Peter, the more I enjoyed his company. He reminded me, in a lot of ways, of Neville. They were both timid, complete rubbish in potions, gullible, and fierce friends. I hadn't really expected any of that from him. I thought he would just be the tagalong of the group, but that was far from the truth. Peter was just as important as the rest of the group, offering support and quick with a smile. 

""Heads up, 3 o'clock."" Sirius coughed into his fist.

I looked over to Jenkins striding our way, a look of determination carved into his sharp features. Ducking my head, I sent up a silent prayer that he wouldn't find the chocolate frog I'd hidden in the fold of my boot. 

""Morning, Potter."" Jenkins said, stopping behind me.

I twisted in my seat and smiled sweetly. ""Morning. What brings you to this end of the table, Cap?""

He crossed his arms with a stony expression. ""I've decided to save myself the headache of trying to confiscate your endless supply of candy, especially since I know you're going to restock today.""

Hope filled my chest. ""So I can eat candy?'

""Yes. Instead of taking it away, you will now be joining me twice a week for cardio workouts in the morning.""

And the hope was gone again. ""But-""

He held up his hand, stopping my protest. ""No buts. I'll let you know later this week when we'll start."" 

And with that happy thought, Jenkins turned on his heel to join his friends who were waiting for him by the doors. I groaned and let my head fall back in dismay. None of my other quidditch captains had been this strict with my candy addiction. It's not like I would but on any weight. Mrs. Weasley had been trying to fatten me up for years with no success. 

""Tough luck, mate."" Sirius said simpithetically.

""Oh, sod off."" I mumbled. 

Once we had all finished eating, the five of us made our way to the Entrance Hall where students were already waiting for Filch to set us free on the village. The only difference I could find in the Filch of my time and the Filch of 1975, was that he seemed to have more hair on his head. Other than that, he was still the sullen git he's always been. When I reached him, he eyed me with suspicion but let me continue on towards the carriages.

The ride to the small village was rather quick, and before I knew, James was leading me towards Honeydukes. This was the first time I would spend any extended period alone with James. To my utter relief, conversation flowed easily between the two of us. Not that I had thought it wouldn't, but it was still a nice feeling knowing that I could hang out with the boy who would be my father and it was easy. He pointed out different shops as we walked, telling me which one he liked. The air was chilled, and by the time we reached Honeydukes my nose was pink.

When we reached the shop and I didn't immediately take off and start grabbing different sweets, James raised an eyebrow at me. ""If you're worried about money, don't today's on me.""

Gratitude filled my chest before I browsing the selections. I grabbed a box of chocolate frogs, two bags of jumping snakes, six bars of chocolate, and a licorice wand. James shook his head at me. ""That won't last you two weeks."" Then proceeded load up my arms with all the candy I could hold. The witch behind the counter smiled kindly at us as she rang up our stuff. 

""Your total is twelve galleons, four sickles, and one knut."" She informed James who handed over the gold before I grabbed the bag.

""Now, to the best store in town."" James exclaimed, leading me to where Zonko's stood. 

The shop was packed with students. James seemed to know exactly what he wanted, because he led me expertly through the crowd.

""You see, young Harry, dung bombs are essential in a prankster's arsonal. As are fizzing whizbees, itching powder, and you can never go wrong with an anti-gravity hat."" He said wisely. 

I rolled my eyes good naturedly. What a dork. The shopkeeper seemed familiar enough with James, and added in a box of stink pellets for his ""best customer"". By the time we finished, it was time to meet the others for lunch at the Three Broomsticks. My stomach rumbled loudly at the thought of mincemeat pie and a steaming mug of butterbeer. The pub was surprisingly empty for a Hogsmeade weekend, but that was fine with me. I scanned the crowd for our friends, and spotted Lily's red hair immediately.

""James, darling."" A kind voice said from behind me.

I turned and watched as a beautiful woman pulled James in for a tight hug. I blinked when she turned her hazel eyes on me. 

""You must be Hariah. I'm Euphemia Potter, and this is my husband, Fleamont.""

Whatcha think? Let me know in the comment section down below.

Harry speaks to her grandparents, and James loses his hair.

Hey everyone! I'm excited to see what everyone think about this chapter.Harry's song for this one is 'Lost Boy'.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""James was certainly right, you two could be twins!"" Mr. Potter said with a grin as he and his wife looked me over with curious eyes.

""Oh, yes, well."" I struggled with an answer that would please them. ""I'm told I took after my dad.""

Mrs. Potter led us over to an empty table and motioned for me to sit down. ""Really? Who is your father?""

My heart pounded in my chest. ""You wouldn't know him. He died when I was little."" He's sitting next to you.

A sympathetic look came across her face. ""James mentioned as much.""

Rosmerta came over and took everyone order while I panicked on the inside. What the bloody hell, James! This was more than likely his idea. No doubt his parents were going to ask all sorts of questions I wouldn't have the answer to, or couldn't say. If I'd know I was going to be ambushed, I would have spoken to Dumbledore first. Or hid in the Room of Requirement. Now I was sitting across from my grandparents who had come to Merlin knows what conclusions about me. Sure, Mrs. Potter had seemed pleasant enough in her letters, but I never imagined I would be having lunch with her. I could see Sirius over Mr. Potter's shoulder giving me a thumbs up. Was it that obvious how out of sorts I was?

""And your mother?"" Mr. Potter asked when our butterbeers had arrived.

""Dead. They were murdered when I was a baby."" At his alarmed expression I rushed on in a panic. ""It's fine! I mean, It's not fine that they were killed, but I honestly didn't even know until I was eleven. I was told they died in a car accident. I didn't even know I was a witch until Hag-"" I shut up before I could blurt anything else out. This was going to be a long day.

James looked at me with a frown. ""I didn't know that. I knew you were raised by muggles, but you never mentioned you didn't even know about magic.""

I swallowed. ""It never came up.""

There was an awkward pause while everyone sipped from their mugs. I found myself wishing the floor would open up and swallow me. What was everyone thinking? It hadn't occurred to me that Dumbledore had created more problems for me when he announced I was a Potter. What if my grandparents thought I was some kind of imposter trying to get herself written in their will? What if they hated me?""

""I'm not your daughter."" I blurted. ""I know you know that, but I just wanted you to know that I don't want anything. I didn't even know I was going to meet you until I saw you.""

To my surprise, Mr. Potter let out a hearty laugh. ""My dear, Hariah. I think my wife agrees with me when I say that I don't think you're after anything here.""

I let out a breath I didn't know I had been holding. The relief I felt was enough that when I lifted my hand to adjust my glasses, it was shaking. They didn't think I was after their fortune, or name. Maybe, just maybe, they really did just think I was a friend of James. One that happened to look just like him and share the same last name. It was the best I could hope for, and hope I did.

When our food arrived, the air around the table was much lighter. Easy conversation flowed between the three of us. Mr. Potter had a way with words that painted clear images. Mrs. Potter had the same sense of humor as James. These were things I had never dreamt of knowing about my family. I could almost imagine what my life could have been. Lunches with my grandparents in Diagon Alley, family dinners, family jokes... 

""Wait, you invented Sleekeazy's Hair Potion?"" I asked, bewildered. 

""That's Fleamont. Ever the inventor."" Mrs. Potter said affectionately. 

James raised an eyebrow. ""You didn't know that?""

I shook my head, still slightly amazed. ""No, I had no idea.""

""I was his guinea pig."" James sighed dramatically.

Mr. Potter smiled sheepishly. ""James was actually the inspiration. Euphemia tried every charm she knew to try and get his hair to lay flat, but nothing worked. The formula took a few tries, but I got it right in the end.""

""A few tries? All of my hair fell out!"" James said, exasperated.

I laughed at the image of James with no hair. ""Now that's something I would've liked to see.""

""Hey!"" James feigned hurt. ""That's not how you talk to your big brother.""

I rolled my eyes, a slight smile touched my lips. ""Well, then it's a good thing you're not my brother. Big or otherwise.""

""Am I older than you?"" James asked.

""When's your birthday?"" It struck me for the first time that I didn't know.

""March 27th.""

""July 31st.""

James grinned. ""I knew I was older.""

""Practically ancient."" I agreed.

 

The next few hours saw us in a robes shop. Mrs. Potter was placing different dresses, blouses, trousers, skirts, and cloaks into my arms with orders to try them on while Mr. Potter and James watched on in amusement. I had blush horribly when James announced it was time to take me clothes shopping. I protested, telling them there was no need.

""Harry, you can't keep wearing Evan's clothes.""

And with that the argument had been settled. I finally knew what Lily had meant about someone buying me clothes. It struck me how long James and Lily had been planning this meeting. It was touching. They hadn't known me, and I had constantly tried to push them away. They were good people.

Slipping a green dress over my head, I stepped out of the dressing room. Mrs. Potted smiled, pleased. ""Beautiful.""

Big things happening in the next chapter! I mean, BIIIIIIIIG things. Like, huge plot points. It's taken forever to get to this point, but hopefully it will be worth the wait. Also, for those of you whom I've asked to be in this story, prepare to keep your eye out!Whatcha think? Let me know in the comment section down below.

Alice is sick and Sirius teases Lily.

Welcome to the Halloween chapter!So, this is the same day Hariah went to hogsmeade. I know that Halloween was on a friday that year, but for storytelling purposes, I've decided to move it to saturday. And as we all know, the first Hogsmeade weekend is the weekend of Halloween. It made more sense for me to switch the order of these events.Also, I was saving this for tomorrow, but what the hay? Enjoy.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

It seemed that Lily dressing me was becoming a habit. Not that I really minded. I had never owned clothes like these before and wouldn't know where to start. When Hermione, Ron, and I had been on the run, my clothes hadn't been important. They had mostly consisted of clothes Hermione had modified from being Dudley's size to mine. So that night when we got back from Hogsmeade, Lily dragged me and the many bags of new clothes, cloaks, and shoes up to our dorm to get ready for the Halloween feast. 

""Ooh, what about this one?"" Lily asked, holding up a golden floor length dress.

I raised an eyebrow. ""I don't think a formal dress is something you wear to a Halloween feast.""

""And how would you know?""

I shrugged. ""If it was formal, we would have been told.""

""Fine."" She pouted before moving on to another dress. ""This is the one!""

The dress she was holding was the same one Mrs. Potter had me try on first. The emerald green silk was the exact shade of my eyes. The cut was definitely flattering, and fell just above my knees. It was one of my favorites because it was simple. ""Alright, but I'm not wearing heels.""

Lily rolled her eyes before tossing me the dress. ""Just get dressed.""

Looking in the mirror, I couldn't help but stare at the different scars I had collected on my arms. On one forearm was the uneven scarring of where the basilisk tooth had pierced my arm. On the other arm was the long and jagged scar I had received the night Voldemort had come back. The back of my left hand glared back at me in my own handwriting, 'I Must Not Tell Lies'. Then there was the newest addition. The cut along my wrist from Remus stood out red and angry looking. No one had seen these scars save Pomfrey and Dumbledore. They were ugly. But they were proof of the trials I had been through, so I couldn't resent them or how I had come to receive them. 

I stepped out of the bathroom. Lily's smile faltered when she took in the different scars. ""When are you going to tell me what happened to you?""

My chest constricted. ""I don't know if I can.""

She grasped my hands tightly in her own. ""You can tell me anything, Harry. As much or as little as you want.""

""Thank you."" I swallowed past the lump in my throat.

She squeezed my hands before letting them go and handing me a pair of sleek black slippers. As I put them on, I noticed what Lily was wearing for the first time. A pretty red dress heels that made her beauty that much more evident. She really was the most beautiful witch I had ever seen. A part of me wished I could have taken after her just a little bit more.

""Ready?"" She asked brightly.

""As I'll ever be.""

Together we made our way down to the feast. The Hall was decorated in the same spectacular fashion that never ceased to amaze me. Bats flew around the enchanted ceiling, pumpkins the size of small automobiles floated low with their glowing enchanted smiles, and the house ghosts popped out of different platters of food when unsuspecting first years made to grab from them. Peter waved us over from the middle of the Gryffindor table.

Lily and I joined them as Sirius let out catcalls. ""You certainly clean up nicely, Harry.""

""This is all Lily. I would have prefered a pair of trousers and a shirt."" I told him as I sat in between Remus and Alice. 

Alice smiled sweetly at me. I hadn't spoken more than a few words to her in my time here. Afterall, what do you say to your friends mum who was driven to insanity? The only time I had ever seen her was at St. Mungo's, christmas afternoon. It hurt knowing that one day she wouldn't even be able recognize her only child. My silence towards her didn't stop Alice from being kind to me. It wasn't hard to see where Neville got it from. 

""You look lovely, Harry."" She said.

""Thank you, Alice."" I mumbled, unsure of what to say.

The food before me made my mouth water in anticipation. Soon enough my plate was brimming with all sorts of food. Food was something I had never taken for granted. Not when the Dursleys made a habit of withholding it as punishment, and my year spent on the run where it became normal to be hungry. When the first course was replaced with the second, I dug in with viger.

""What'd you think of the Potters, Harry?"" Remus asked me.

I swallowed my mouthful of roasted potatoes. ""It was different than I was expecting.""

""What were you expecting?"" He asked curiously.

""Well, I honestly thought they were going to think I was after their fortune.""

James rolled his eyes. ""Dad's way to nice to think that, and mum's always wanted a girl she can spoil.""

""You're a good person."" Peter assured me. ""Anyone can see that.""

I smiled at him, still slightly baffled by the boy sitting next to James. Before I could respond, Alice let out a string of painful coughs. Fank, who sat next to her, placed his hand protectively on her back as she struggled to breath. I passed her a goblet of pumpkin juice which she gladly sipped from.

""Your cough's gotten worse. I think you should go see Madam Pomfrey."" He said quietly to her.

She looked down at her plate, clearly embarrassed by the concerned looks everyone was sending her. ""But the feast isn't over.""

Before I knew what I was saying, I said, ""I can bring you some desserts, if you want.""

Alice sent me a grateful look. ""Really? I don't want to be a bother.""

""It's no trouble."" I assured her.

With one final smile, she let Frank whisk her away. Lily frowned with worry as dessert finally appeared a few minutes later. I scooped a nice size helping of chocolate pudding onto my plate, preparing to leave early so I could bring Alice something. 

""James and I have a get together planned after the feast."" Sirius announced as he took a bite of tiramisu. 

Lily groaned. ""If it's anything like last year, count me out.""

Sirius grinned. ""Afraid you won't be able to keep up with me, Evans?""

""You know I would have won last year if it weren't for Peter making me lose concentration."" Lily said rather sorely.

I raised an eyebrow. ""What exactly happened last year?""

""Every year, James and Sirius plan a surprise after the feast."" Remus explained. ""Last year was a championship wizards chess competition. For every piece you took, you had to take a shot of firewhiskey. Every piece you lost, was two shots. It was a close match between Lily and Sirius, but in the end Lily lost one to many pieces.""

I laughed, shaking my head at the image of a drunk Lily and Sirius battling it out over wizards chess. Lily and Sirius continued to bicker of last years competition. James look torn when he was called on to take sides.

""Oh, er... Lily definitely should have won.""

""See!"" Lily said smugly.

Sirius looked absolutely betrayed. 

I wrapped up a few different sweets in a napkin before standing. ""I'm going to take these to Alice and Frank.""

James looked up from the argument that continued to unravel between his best friend and the girl he liked. ""Alright. Be back in the common room in an hour for the celebration.""

I nodded before making my way out of the Great Hall. Today was turning out to be one of the best in my life. I had met my grandparents, owned clothes that were just mine, spent the day with my dad, and dressed up with my mum. Anything I had imagined up as a child paled in comparison to the real thing. I was getting to know my family. Nothing could ruin it. 


""Ssso hungry... I can sssmell it... I can sssmell blood... rip, ssshred...""


I froze in my tracks causing someone to run into me. I blinked and turned to see a pretty girl with dark brown hair and eyes that seemed to be the exact same shade. It contrasted nicely with her pale skin.

""Oh, I'm so sorry!"" She said with wide eyes.


""Kill...kill...KILL!""


""This can't be real."" I whispered to myself. There was no possible way I was hearing that voice that had haunted my step second year.

I barely registered the concerned look the girl was giving me before taking off in a dead run for the third floor corridor. This wasn't happening. How could it? The chamber wasn't suppose to open for another seventeen years. Not until I was a second year. So why was I hearing this voice here and now?

I slowed down when I stepped into the flooded hallway. My heart was pounding in my ears, my sight narrowed into a tunnel.


The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir... beware.


BUM BUM BUUUUUUUUUH!!!!Did you see it coming? I hope I caught you off guard, my pretties. This was a hard chapter to writer for me simply because I knew what was going to happen, but I had to add in a bit more than expected to make it flow.Whatcha think? Let me know in the comment section down below.

The Chamber had been opened, and Harry feels lost.

Hey everyone. I am sooooooo so so so sorry about the wait! I just started a new job and that has kept me super busy. Anyway, here is the next chapter.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

My mind refused to believe what my eyes were seeing. It was impossible. None of this was suppose to happen. But it was. Mrs. Norris hung stiffly by her tail beneath the threatening words, swaying slightly. A line of spiders fled from the hall. I stepped forward, drawing my wand. No matter how much I hated the cat, she still didn't deserve to just hang there. I swiftly levitated her way from the wall, keeping her suspended so she didn't have to lay on the wet floor. Footsteps sounded from behind me and I whirled around, wand pointed with deadly accuracy. The girl who had bumped into me stared on with wide, horrified eyes.

""What-?""

""It wasn't me."" I lowered my wand. ""You need to get Dumbledore.""

She eyed me suspiciously. ""What happened to Mrs. Norris?""

""She's been petrified."" I answered impatiently. ""Get. Dumbledore.""

After a moment's hesitation she nodded and ran down the corridor. I turned back to the wall. Dumbledore would know what to do. He always did. Maybe he could explain why this was happening. As I stood alone, I noticed for the first time that I was no longer holding the sweets ment for Alice. Maybe I could get her something from the kitchens. I almost smiled bitterly from the thought. Now wasn't the time to worry about that. No, I had much bigger problems. One of which floated eerily before me. 

I needed to find the basilisk and kill it. But would that really solve the problem? If the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, then that means Tom Riddle's diary had somehow managed to find it's way to Hogwarts. Someone had to have it and in turn was being possessed by one of Voldemort's horcruxes. My heart pounded loudly in my chest. How was I going to find it? It had been sheer dumb luck the first time that everything had turned out alright the first go round. But twice? Not likely.

More footsteps splashed through the water. Dumbledore strode towards me and took in the sight before him. His electric blue eyes scanned the message and a grim line overtook his mouth. He turned to the girl behind him.

""Thank you, Miss Greengrass. That will be all. If you could kindly return to you common room, the rest of your housemates will be joining you shortly.""

Greengrass nodded, a nervousness clear in the set of her shoulders. Once she left, Dumbledore turned to Mrs. Norris. ""Miss Greengrass said you claimed she was petrified.""

I nodded. ""This isn't suppose to happen yet.""

I watched as the Headmaster sent several patronus flying down the corridor. ""If you would kindly levitate Mrs. Norris to my Office, we have much to discuss.""

The walk to his office felt like it dragged on forever. We met no one on our way and the halls rang with silence. I felt detached to everything around me. This had to be a nightmare. One that I hadn't woken up from yet. But the longer we walked the more I realized that everything was real. There wasn't any waking up from this. However it came about, this was happening whether I thought it should or not. It seemed like we reached Dumbledore's office both too quickly and not fast enough. I followed the headmaster up the stairs before sitting in the chair before his desk. Mrs. Norris landed softly on the hard wood, her body refusing to rest on it naturally.

Dumbledore peered over his half moon spectacles with serious eyes. ""You said this wasn't suppose to happen yet. Can you elaborate for me?""

I nodded dully. ""The chamber of secrets wasn't suppose to be opened until 1992, my second year at Hogwarts. This is how it started. I heard a voice-""

""Who's voice?"" Dumbledore asked, leaning forward.

""Not who, what."" I told him. ""The voice belonged to a basilisk.""

""You're a parselmouth.""

I drew my eyebrows together and shook my head. ""I... I wasn't born one.""

He raised an eyebrow, but nodded for me to continue.

""Well, after Mrs. Norris, several other students were attacked and petrified. Eventually Hagrid was arrested, and you were removed from Hogwarts. I found a diary someone had tried to get rid of. The diary contained a sixteen year old boy, Tom Riddle. The diary was stolen from me, and not long after a new message appeared; 'Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever'. Ginny Weasley, my best friends sister, had been taken."" I took a shaky breath. ""Ron and I knew what was in the chamber of secrets, Hermione had figured it out before she was petrified, so we entered it. Ron and I got separated so I went on ahead.""

""You see, before school had started that year, Lucius Malfoy slipped the diary into Ginny's things. She began writing in it and talking to Tom. The more of herself she poured into it, the easier it was for him to control her. He made her open the chamber of secrets, and write those messages. By the end, her was stealing her life. When I found her, Tom was already able to exist outside of the diary he had been bound to. The transference had yet to be complete, but Ginny was almost dead. Tom took my wand and summoned the basilisk.""

""Fawkes appeared, blinded the snake, and dropped the sorting hat. I was able to draw the sword of Gryffindor and kill it. One of its fangs became embedded in my arm, "" I held said arm out, showing him the scar it had left. ""and I was able to destroy the diary and Tom with it before it killed Ginny.""

Dumbledore looked to be deep in thought. ""Fawkes healed you, I take it.""

I nodded.

""You must have shown me great loyalty for Fawkes to come to your aid."" Dumbledore smiled gently. 

I shrugged sheepishly. 

""Do you know what the diary was?""

I hesitated. ""If I tell you, I can never go back to my time, can I?""

""My dear, I fear that wouldn't be possible now due to the changes your presence has already made."" He told me gravely.

I felt as though he had slapped me. This was it. The choice had been taken from me just like every other one in my life. I was powerless to control my destiny. A loneliness like no other creeped into my bones. This isn't the life I wanted. Hadn't I done enough? Why was the weight of the wizarding world always lain on my shoulders?

I swallowed past the sudden bitterness I felt. ""The diary is a horcrux. Voldemort made seven in total, with the seventh one being me. The night he tried to kill me, a part of his soul latched onto me. He never meant for it to happen.""

The office was quiet. I found my eyes drawn back to the cat that lay stiff on the desk. She was just the first. How many more would join her? How many would die this time?

""For now, we must concentrate our efforts on finding the diary."" Dumbledore broke the silence. ""We can't alert the horcrux that we know what's happening.""

""What about the basilisk?""

""We will put precautions in place to protect the students.""

Disbelief and anger wrestled in my belly. ""We're just going to let it roam free?!""

""If we were to killed it, we would no longer be able to predict what is going to happen. It would change events in such a way that would make the diary unpredictable and far more dangerous."" He explained patiently. 

I clenched my jaw and nodded. ""The diary could be with anyone, how do you suppose we'll find it?""

Dumbledore leaned back. ""More than likely it's in the possession of a girl. Girls are far more likely to write in a diary. We can also narrow the list down by those who have contact with Lucius Malfoy, and other known supporters of Voldemort. This narrows the list down to pure blooded girls.""

I 'hmm'ed. It wasn't much, but it was a start.

So, whatcha think? Let me know in the comments section down below.

Harry talks to the gang and there's a party to plan.

I'm the worst. I wanted this chapter to cover so much more but I couldn't keep you guys waiting any longer. My excuses are1. Work has been crazy.2. My mom went into the hospital.3. I'm dating(?) someone (we still haven't put any labels on it, so I don't know wtf we are).4. I'm lazy.The next chapter won't take so long to publish, I swear solemnly! Enjoy.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

I kept my eyes low and my grip on my wand tight as I made the trek back to the Gryffindor tower. Every little noise made me raise my wand with a spell on my lips before I realized it was just a suit of armour and not the basilisk. The further away from Dumbledore I got, the more anxious I became. I understood why he didn't want to kill the basilisk yet, but I couldn't help but feeling what we were doing was wrong. Isn't it our duty to protect those who couldn't protect themselves? It would be so easy to go down to the Chamber of Secrets, summon a rooster, and kill the monster. We were getting people's lives by allowing it to live. After all, it took nearly a year for the diary to grow powerful enough to drain Ginny's life and take a form of it's own. That would give us plenty of time to find it and destroy it. 

I shook my head. No, I needed to trust Dumbledore. He knew what he was doing. I shoved my doubts to the back of my mind as I reached the Gryffindor Tower. Lily was pacing near the portrait hole of the empty common room. I could see James shaking his leg from where he sat near the fire, and Remus sitting next to him calmly. Peter was chewing anxiously on him nails while Sirius had his back turned towards me, standing in front of the fire. Lily was the first to notice me.

""Thank Merlin."" She said as she pulled me into a tight hug.

I pat her back, relieved everyone was okay. James, Remus and Peter jumped up and made their way to us. Lily pulled back and looked at my face.

""What's happening?"" James asked. ""Someone said there was a message written in blood.""

I cast my eyes down. ""There... There is.""

A hand was placed on my shoulder. I met Remus' eyes. Grim understanding shone in them. He knew that whatever was happening shouldn't be. Otherwise I wouldn't look so unnerved.

""Where were you?"" Peter asked.

""With Dumbledore."" I confessed. James placed his arm around my shoulder and led me toward the couch were everyone sat with their eyes on me.

""You found the writting."" Remus stated rather than asked. 

I nodded slowly. 

""What did it say?"" Peter asked, nervous. 

I chill ran down my spine as the image floated before my eyes. How was any of this possible? This was because of me. I was changing things and I could never go back to my time. I would never spend the summer at the Burrow, study with Hermione, or pig out with Ron. Why hadn't I died that night? I should have died. Then none of this would be happening. My parents and their friends wouldn't be facing this threat, and I would have to live with the guilt that was crushing my lungs.

""Harry?"" Remus asked with a worried frown.

I blinked. ""'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir... beware'.""

""What does it mean?"" Lily asked after a moment.

My eyebrows drew together. ""I... I don't know.""

But I did. I knew exactly what was coming. Dumbledore knew, and we could stop it. But we weren't. And now my mother's life was in danger. What would happen to me if she died? Would I simply disappear?

 

 

Breakfast the next morning was filled with students talking excitedly about the message left next to the abandoned girls lavatory. Everyone seemed to know what had been written, and no one seemed to care that it was a threat against a large portion of the school. Anger bubbled up at me when I spotted Dumbledore sitting calmly at the head table. He knew what was really happening. Why wasn't he acting? Who cared if it spooked the diary! By taking away its biggest weapon, we were keeping the school safe from a terrifying fate, and if the diary acted rashly, at this point it's hold over it's user would still be too weak to cause harm. 

I rubbed my scar and looked down at my untouched food. It was hard to force myself to do nothing. For almost a year I was constantly moving forward in my efforts to defeat Voldemort. Now that inaction was the course I was being forced to take, I felt restless and without a purpose. Forcing myself to eat, I listened to what James was saying to Sirius.

""...for your birthday.""

Sirius grinned. ""I was thinking bigger than last year.""

""Wait,"" I looked over at Sirius. He and James looked over at me at the sudden interruption. ""It's your birthday day after tomorrow.""

""That's why we're planning a party."" Sirius said with an amused tone. ""Though, I'm touch you know.""

Of course I knew when his birthday was. Sirius was my godfather. 

""I just realized that I don't know when your birthday is, Harry."" James said, blinking in realization.

I couldn't help the slight smile that found it's way onto my mouth. My own dad, who was there at my birth, didn't know when I was born. Even with the threat of last night still so fresh on my mind, I found myself happy enough to answer. "" It's July, 31st.""

""I knew I was older."" James said smugly.

I rolled my eyes fondly. 

This was something I was going to protect. James, Sirius, Remus, Lily, Severus, even Peter. I would be damned before I let any of them come to harm.

Sirius Black was born Nov. 3, 1959. Aaaaaany way......Whatcha Think? Let me know in the comment section down below.

Harry has to wake up early and Severus wants to be left alone.

Hey. So, here's the deal. I hate Christmas. A close friend of mine passed away at the beginning of december, my grandma passed away on the 28th, and another friend was killed in a car accident on the 31st. Despite all that, I still felt reeeeeaaaaaly guilty for not taking the time to post the next chapter. Without further ado, vwala!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

It took all I had to drag myself out of bed and down to the Quidditch pitch were Jenkins was waiting for me. Yesterday he informed me that our first workout session would be at 6:00 AM sharp. It seemed so trivial and unimportant in light of recent events. Who cared if I ate candy when there was a fifty food killing machine roaming free that Dumbledore refused to do anything about? I shrugged on a light sweater and made my way down from the Gryffindor Tower. My wand, as it had become habit once again, was held firmly in my right hand. 

Sleep had evaded me in the two nights since the Chamber had been opened. I found myself straining to try and hear any eerie voices when I lay in my four post bed while everyone else slept soundly. It was hard not to grow cross with James and Sirius. They had tried to reassure me that Dumbledore wouldn't let anything happen to any of his students, that we were all safe so long as he was around. They didn't know that he knew just how dangerous the school had become and opted to wait. I understood that he didn't want to risk the horcrux lashing out in a way we couldn't predict, especially since the diary could be anywhere and we had little means of discovering with whom it was possessing. Standing idly by has never been something I was good at. It's just not who I am. It crossed my mind several times that I could simply go to the Chamber of Secrets by myself and summon a rooster to kill the basilisk. But then the battle at the Ministry would drag itself to the forefront of my mind to stop me. My rash decision to try and rescue Sirius from Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries cost me my godfather. What if going against Dumbledore in his choice to observe cost me someone else's life? Could I really risk that?

The brisk air slammed into me when I stepped onto the lawn. Pulling my sweater tighter around myself, I crosses to the Quidditch pitch in a hurried pace. Jenkins waited for me on the field, his arms crossed.

""Ready for warm-ups, Potter?""

""No."" I grumbled, shivering against the breeze.

""That's the spirit. Three laps, let's go."" He took off in a light jog with me following reluctantly behind him. 

In 1998, this amount of running would have been a breeze. this, however, was not the case in 1975. My fifteen-year-old wasn't as used to this type of physical activity. Sure, I was fit in my fifth year. Just not in shape. I wouldn't gain any real muscle until I went on the run with Ron and Hermione. By the end of our last lap my breathing was coming fast and my heart was pounding. 

""Right."" Jenkins said. ""Now that our blood's pumping, we need to stretch. Can't having you pull something.""

I was thankful for the slight pause and began to run through a few different stretches. Next I was led through the stands, running up and down every step in the stadium. The stitches in my sides ached when we moved onto lunges, then blurples. The next two hours passed in a similar manner as Jenkins ran me ragged. I had never been more thankful go to breakfast. 

""Good work today, Potter."" Jenkins said as we entered the Great Hall.

""How are you not as tired as I am?"" I demanded.

He grinned down at me. ""My dad's a muggle personal trainer. The two of us always start our morning like that.""

""You're bloody mad.""

I plopped down next to Lily at the Gryffindor table and loaded up my plate with everything I could get my hands on. Who knew pumpkin juice could taste so good? It wasn't until I finished my third goblet that I forced myself to slow down.

""You smell awful, Harry."" Lily wrinkled her nose at me. 

""First workout with Jenkins."" I explained between bites. ""Is it really that bad?""

She nodded sympathetically.

""I'll make sure to shower before breakfast next time."" I told her. 

 

 

After I showered and changed, I began to hunt down Severus. More than likely it was a Slytherin girl who had possession of Tom Riddle's diary, and the best way to find out who was to get into their Common Room. That's where Severus came in. I needed to get him to invite me in. If that failed I could always just use the Marauder's Map to figure out the password and my invisibility cloak to sneak inside, but if I were to get caught doing that it could cause more problems than it would solve.

A quick scan of the Map told me Severus was by himself in the Library. The halls were scattered with students enjoy the last of the weekend before we all went back to school tomorrow. I found myself scanning the faces of every girl I past, suspicion ever present in the back of my head. Did they have the diary on them? The wand in my pocket pressed against my side. I found a slight comfort by it. It might not have been my wand to start with, but I was grateful for it nonetheless.

""Lala, get back here!""

A shout drew me from my thoughts. From around the corner a small ginger cat shot out. It startled me when it suddenly leapt from the floor and into my chest. My arms automatically came up to supports it. A tall girl appeared in from of me, her cheeks slightly flushed from apparently chasing the small cat around the corridors.

""Thank Merlin, you caught her."" The girls said with a relieved smile. 

Her short bright red hair curled wildly around her neck. I had to look up to see past her rectangular glasses and meet her grey eyes. My attention was drawn back to the cat when she began to meow loudly. 

""More like she caught me."" I told the tall girl. 

""Sorry about her,"" the girl said. ""She escaped from my common room again. I'm Emily, by the way. The escape artist is Lala.""

""Oh, er, I'm Harry.""

Emily smiled widely at me as I handed over her cat who meowed loudly in complaint. ""I know. In fact, I don't think there's a person here who doesn't know who you are. After all, it's hard to forget someone who bursts into lunch looking like she was mauled by a troll. Plus we have charms together.""

I blinked, taken aback by her blunt response. ""Right. Well it's nice to meet you, Emily. I was just on my way to the library, so...""

I stepped around her and continued down the corridor. It took only a moment for Emily and her cat to fall into step with me. ""We should be friends, Harry.""

I found myself dumbfounded once again by her sudden declarations. ""Uh, sure.""

She beamed at me. ""Brilliant! I should get going. Lala might make another run for it. Later Harry!""

And just like that she was gone as quickly as she appeared. To say that was odd seemed an understatement. I pushed Emily and her cat from my thoughts as I entered the Library. Severus was sitting alone at a table in the back with his nose in a notebook. I sat down in the chair across from him. He kept his focus on what he was writing, ignoring me. Watching him, I tried to spot the similarities between him and the Potions Master he would become. His hair was still greasy and hung in his eyes, and he still had the same crease between his eyebrows. Fifteen-year-old Severus seemed softer, however. Just as grouchy, but somehow not as rough. No doubt that changed when he became a death eater. 

Severus exhaled sharply from his nostrils. ""Are you just going to stare at me or are you going to tell me what it is you want?""

A grin was pulled from my lips. ""Ever the charmer, Severus.""

A slight blush filled his pale cheeks. ""What do you want, Potter?""

""I was hoping we could hang out today.""

He turned back to his notebook. ""What does Lily have in mind?""

I shifted in my seat. ""I meant just us.""

His quill paused just above the page. I went on quickly. ""I was hoping that we could be friends. Not because of Lily, but because we want to be.""

Severus looked up at me with narrowed eyes before slamming his notebook shut. ""Nice try, Potter. Tell your brother that he'll have to try harder for his next prank.""

""Wait!"" I half shouted. ""I'm not here because of James or some stupid prank. I'm here because I want to be your friend.""

He glared at me. ""And what makes you think I want you as a friend?""

""Because I don't want anything from you but friendship.""

His dark eyes were calculating. It was true, I really did want to be friends with Severus. He would grow to be a brave man. Maybe not a good one, but one that would save my life on numerous accounts. After everything he would put himself through, I wanted to do this one thing for him. That, and I needed his help getting into his common room. I pushed back the guilt I felt at wanting to use him. It was only until I discovered the diary. Then I would focus on being the friend Severus was going to need.

""Fine, Potter.""

I beamed at him. 

""Now go away.""

I frowned. ""I thought we were going to hang out today.""

""I agreed to be 'friends', not to spend any time with you."" Severus sneered.

I shrugged easily. ""It's a start.""

Whatcha think? Let me know in the comment section down below.

Sirius becomes a king, and Harry deals with a drunk James.

School is crazy. Enjoy!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

The next morning started with a bang. Literally.

Lily, Alice, and I made our way down for breakfast. Alice was just as sweet as her son, Neville, would grow to be. Perhaps with my new life in the past I could prevent her's and Frank's torture to insanity. Maybe then their son would finally feel like he belonged in Gryffindor. In our third year, Neville had confessed to asking the Sorting Hat to place him in Hufflepuff. 

""Are you sure you're okay, Harry?"" Alice asked with worry. ""You look ill.""

I shrugged her off. ""Just tired, s'all.""

Dark circles had taken residence under my eyes and my skin seemed paler than normal. In the past three nights I had only managed to get around four hours of sleep. Fear for my friends and family swirled around me at night. Every shadow became a possible threat. Sleep was hard to find when the slightest shift in the room had me reaching for my wand. By the time I managed to nod off, Lily was waking me up for breakfast. The sooner I found the diary, the better. 

Just as we reached the entrance to the Great Hall, a sharp bang! ricochet off the walls. In the span of my next breath, my wand was raised defensively and I hand pushed Lily and Alice behind me. They let out a frightened yelled at being jerked back, but there wasn't time to spare them any attention. Every muscle in my body was tensed, waiting to leap towards the threat. Instead of a monster unleashing its power on the crowd of unsuspecting students, a giant shimmering banner had appeared and confetti rained down across the entrance way. Trumpets began to sound as though announcing something important.


HAPPY BIRTHDAY KING SIRIUS!


I lowered my wand, blinking and the sight of at least fifty students nearly buried in scarlet and gold bits of paper.

This wasn't an attack.

My hands shook from the adrenalin that had nowhere to go. I felt incredibly foolish for having reacted how I did. Why would the Basilisk attack now when it wasn't part of it's MO? A hand was placed on my shoulder making me start at the sudden contact. Lily looked at me with concern. 

""Sorry."" I mumbled.

""What's wrong Harry?"" She asked softly.

I wanted to tell her everything. That I was was jumpy because I was use to being hunted by people who wanted me dead. That there was a monster lurking in the pipes and I was waiting for it to attack. Instead I gave a shaky smile and put my wand away.

""Just tired. That was quite the surprise so early in the morning.""

Her eyes searched my face for a moment before she nodded and let her hand fall back to her side. I looked back over to the crowd if only to avoid the sympathy I was receiving. 

It didn't take long for me to spot Sirius in the madness. He stood beaming at everyone with an obnoxious glittering gold crown resting on his dark hair and a long flowing red cape. James and Remus stood next to him bowing in a knights armor. Peter appeared to be juggling pins while wearing a jesters costume. A genuine grin formed on my face at the sight. Students around then were laughing and chucking confetti at one another.

After a bit, James stepped forward holding a long scroll in his hands. ""Hear ye, hear ye!""

The crowd quieted down.

""Thine merciful and just King Sirius hast invited thee to join in this, our celebration of his royal majesty's birthday! Thoust may join the celebrations at sundown in the Gryffindor common room, be ye fair maiden and young party goers alike. Long live the King!"" James read in a loud and clear voice.

A cheer rose in the air and the excitement for the party was almost palpable. My fear was long forgotten as I made my way through the sea of confetti and people towards James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter. I stopped in front of them, stooding into an exaggerated curtsy. 

""Your majesty.""

Sirius nodded his head in a regal manner. ""My Lady. Care to join your King for breakfast?""

I fluttered my eyelashes in an exaggerated way. ""What an honor!""

He lifted his chin hauntingly. ""It is an honor that I have charitably bestowed upon you."" He tossed his cape back and offered an arm. ""Shall we?""

I snorted but took his arm anyway. It was, after all, his birthday.

 

Most of the day passed with Sirius being showered in gifts and well wishes from various girls. He accepted it all with a charming smile and a devilish wink. It became hard not to roll my eyes at the girls when they would giggle behind their hands and promise to come to his party. Remus watched on in silent amusement when we were once aging ambushed by a few Hufflepuffs. 

""Is his birthday always like this?"" I asked, watching as one of the girls blushed when Sirius kissed the back of her hand.

""I suppose."" Remus replied. ""Last year it was a beach theme, so the crowd of girls trying to chat up a shirtless Sirius was a bit larger.""

I chuckled lightly. ""And I thought this was bad.""

""Lily mentioned you're not sleeping very well and you've been really jumpy. Does it have anything to do with the Chamber of Secrets?"" Remus asked, turning his gaze on me.

I continued to stare at Sirius who was currently chatting careless with James. My lack of sleep had everything to do with the Chamber. Was I allowed to tell Remus about it? It wasn't like he didn't know about me and had more that likely already come to the conclusion that the Chamber of Secrets had something to do with my being in the past. He could help me keep an eye out for the diary and I had no doubt he would know what to do about the basilisk. It would be so easy to just tell Remus. 

I forced a laugh. ""No, I keep forgetting to get more Dreamless Draughts from the infirmary. I'm sure that Dumbledore has the whole Chamber thing under control."" 

Remus didn't say anything for a moment. We both knew that he knew I was hiding something. But because he's Remus, he just nodded and let it go. Guilt and relief wrestled in my chest. A part of me believed that telling Remus who I was caused the changes that were unraveling. If I were to tell him everything I knew about the Chamber of Secrets, what if I made everything worse? How much damage would I cause?

I shook my head and turned my eyes back on the crowd when I spotted Severus passing the group of girls with a sneer. 

""I'll see you in Transfiguration."" I hastily told Remus before taking off after the greasy haired boy. 

""Severus, wait!"" I called.

He didn't wait. Instead he kept moving through the see of adolescents. I rolled my eyes but continued to push my way to him. ""Hey."" I put my hand on his shoulder with a bright smile.

Severus looked down at me in annoyance as he shrugged me off. ""What do you want, Potter?""

""We've never gone to class together before."" 

""We've walked together before.""

""Only when Lily was with us. I thought it would be fun if just the two of us walked together."" I reminded him.

He scoffed. ""Only someone as dimwitted as you would find this 'fun'.""

""You're in a foul mood."" I bumped my shoulder against his. ""Is it because Gryffindor is going to wipe the floor with Slytherin in the upcoming quidditch match?""

""Definitely not. We're going to crush you.""

""I don't know, Severus. I'm a brilliant seeker."" I told him playfully.

He snorted. ""Certainly an arrogant one.""

We continued to banter back and forth until we reached the classroom. Lily shot us an odd look as we took our seats. ""I see you two have become close.""

I threw my arm around Severus's shoulders. ""How could I resist such charm?""

He scoffed and shrugged me off, his cheeks tinted pink. 

 

The common room that night was, to say the least, crowded and noisy. It seemed like someone from every house had shown up for the party. I found myself wedged on the couch between Peter and a rather large sixth year from Ravenclaw. James and Sirius could be seen in the thickest part of the crowd where at least twenty people seemed to be trying to with King Sirius a happy birthday. 

""You're a good person, Harry."" 

I blinked, my attention being drawn to Peter who was wearing a shy smile. ""Oh, er, you think so?""

He nodded honestly. ""You helped Remus when the rest of us couldn't. Plus, you don't act like I'm some thick wannabe who follows James and Sirius around.""

""Because you're not."" I told him. ""You're funny, nice, and a great friend.""

He looked down at his knees, self conscious. ""You think so?""

""I know so. I count myself lucky to your friend.""

And I did. Peter reminded me so much of Neville in the way that he doubted himself but had no real reason to. He cared for his friend more than anything, and it showed. What exactly would happen to this kind boy that would cause him to betray everything he held most dear. I promised myself in that moment, with Peter grinning at me with such joy, that I would change his future for the better. 

""Harry!"" Sirius called across the room, waving wildly for me to join him.

I rolled my eyes. ""I better go see what his highness wants.""

James shoved a glass of firewhisky into my hand when I reached the two obviously smashed boys. ""S'not nice to hide from your brother, Harry.""

I raised an amused eyebrow at him. ""I was talking to Peter. In plain sight.""

""Firs' you're talkin' to Peter, next you'll be snoggin' some bloke, an' then you'll be getting married!"" James sniffed, his eyes getting misty.

""What?""

""SIrius!"" James cried. ""She's growing up too fast!""

""You've know me less than two months.""

Sirius patted James consolingly. ""S'all right, mate. We'll be brothers for real then. We can even name our firs' kid after you. Right, Harry?""

""First kid- wait. You two aren't still on about that. James, I'm not going to snog some boy, and Sirius and I aren't getting married."" I said in heavy amusement. 

""Hey! Wha's wrong with me?"" Sirius protested through slurred words. 

""Yeah, wha's wrong with him?"" James demanded.

I sighed in slight exasperation. ""Nothing's wrong with you.""

""Then why can't we name our firs' kid after James?""

I rolled my eyes at the pair. ""Fine. Should we ever have children, we can name it after James.""

""You think I- I won' remember 'cause I've been drinking, but I will!"" James proclaimed.

I shook my head with a slight smile. ""I believe you.""

READ ME!

Hey everyone! First off, let me just apologize for the lack of updates. Turns out doing college full time and working full time is a bit much to handle. Fear not! I have not abandoned this story. Thankfully with this semester having ended, I now have time to work on this.

Now with that out of the way, I have to be honest. I have writer's block right now. Here is what I need you, my loyal readers, to do. Harry will be having her first Quidditch match in the next chapter and I want her and Sirius to have a 'moment' so that I can begin to develop their relationship a bit more. Here is where you come in. I would like you to comment an idea of what you would like to see happen between them. Whoever sends me the most inspiring idea, will have it used and also have the chapter dedicated to them.

Here are your guidelines-

1. Keep in mind that it shouldn't be romantic. Harry and Sirius are not far enough along in their relationship for that.

2. I would prefer fluff to angst, but if you want to see angst then include how you would like to see it resolved.

3. The submission can be as detailed or as vague as you want. Just know that I might tweak a few things to help it fit how I see the story going.

4. Comment your idea.

5. Have fun. If I don't use your idea in this chapter, I still have about five more years I want to cover in this series. I might end up using it later and dedicate that chapter to you.

So, yeah. Go wild and help me destroy my mental block!

I haven't forgotten about this fic!  Here's the next chapter.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

The days leading up to the first quidditch match (Gryffindor vs. Slytherin) had been jammed packed with practice, extra workouts, and plenty of inter house banter. Playful and otherwise. Jenkins had taken it upon himself to escort me between classes. When he was in another part of the castle James or Sirius took over. It seemed he was worried the Slytherins would get to me with their insults and the occasional jinx. To him, and everyone else for that matter, I had never experienced the tension between the teams and therefore wouldn't know how to handle it. Sirius regaled me with tales of how low the Slytherins would go to rid themselves of what they viewed as a threat on rival teams. Jenkins didn't want anything to prevent me from catching the snitch, while James and Sirius just seemed to enjoy having the excuse to bother me. It was amusing at first, but when I found someone waiting for me outside the lavatory I was being to feel a twinge of annoyance. 

""James, I can use the restroom by myself."" I told him in exasperation. 

""Of course you can, Harry."" He said, patting me on the head as though he was speaking to a small child.

I had never been so thankful for the hidden passageways in the castle as I was when I finally managed to slip Jenkins in the charm corridor. He was causing more stress than Slytherin house. Between the constant escorts, random tips, and extended practices, I needed some time to simply be alone. Or at least not with them. Our actual opponents were a breath of fresh air with their sneers. Lily and Alice seemed to find great amusement in the way I ducked behind the suits of armor any time I thought someone on the quidditch team was around the corner. Severus had the least amount of patience for how I avoided the others, and refused to walk with me to class if I continued to duck behind him. Our friendship had evolved passed him telling me to leave him alone to him simply accepting (ignoring) my companionship. It was easy to be around him, especially when he wasn't towering over my cauldron while sneering at me. Not that he didn't sneer now. The difference now was teenage Snape had yet to perfect the look, and somehow I managed to find it endearing. If Ron ever heard me say that, he'd probably thing I'd gone mental.

Severus and I spent most of the evening before the match in the library. I was currently hiding from Jenkins while Severus was scrawling tediously in his notebook. Madam Pince kept her eyes trained on me. She made it no secret that she thought I would behave just like James when it came to his carelessness of her books. I would never. Hermione had made sure I had a respect for the written word. Perhaps not the love she had, but definitely an understanding on how precious some people found it. 

""Stop staring."" Severus drawled as he flipped through a book on spells before making a note of it.

""I'm not staring. I'm observing you in your natural habitat. Well, as natural as you can look outside of the potions classroom."" I told him while resting my chin on my hand.

His thick brows drew together and he looked up. ""Shouldn't you be practicing or something for tomorrow?""

I grinned at his obvious annoyance. ""Nope. Besides, Slytherin doesn't stand a chance.""

He snorted. ""You've obviously inherited your brother's thick skull if you think you're winning tomorrows match.""

""He's not my brother, and I'll have you know that my skull is just the right density for someone my size."" I informed him, playfully sticking my nose up with an air of false hurt.

""Of course it is.""

""Take a break from your writing and talk to me."" When he kept writing, I added, ""Don't make me take your notes.""

Severus raised a black eyebrow at me as his quill paused on the parchment. ""Is that not what we're currently doing?""

I shook my head. ""No, it's not. You're only half focused on what we're talking about. You didn't even react when I told you I was madly in love with you.""

""Stop being ridiculous, Potter,"" Severus said through narrowed eyes. ""You never once said that.""

""How would you know? You only have half your attention on what we've been talking about."" I told him innocently. 

I could see him working his jaw before he slammed his notebook closed. ""You're not 'madly in love' with me."" His expression twisted slightly in disgust.

""What's with that look?"" I laughed.

""You look too much like your brother-""

""Not my brother.""

""- for me to take you seriously."" Severus finished.

""What's wrong with how It look? James is a handsome bloke. If I look so much like him, wouldn't that make me beautiful?"" I asked.

Severus seemed to study my face with narrow eyes. It was slightly surprising that he seemed to be seriously considering my jibe. He scanned over my round glasses, wild hair, and lingered on my scar. I reached up and rubbed It. No one really paid the mark any attention anymore. Lily had been caught stairing at it a few times but had never asked what it was. It was still strange being just another face in the crowd. It made me wonder if this was how It would have been had Voldemort not set out to kill me as a child. Traveling back in time to when the lightning shaped mark held no meaning would be the closest It could ever get to 'normal'. Though, if I somehow managed to play my cards right, a future could exist in which I would never have the little scar. My parents would be able to see me off to school for the first time. Peter would never become a traitor. Sirius would never go to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Remus wouldn't have to spend twelve years of full moons alone. 

""How did you get that?"" Severus asked.

My fingers paused. ""Get what?""

He gave me an exasperated look. ""Don't play dumb, Hariah, it doesn't suit you. The scar on your forehead.""

A wide grin spread itself across my face. ""Did you just call me by my name?""

His brow twitched in annoyance. ""Answer the bloody question.""

The smile lost it's bright edge. ""A car crash.""

It wasn't long before Lily found us and dragged us to dinner. I politely refused the offer to join them at the Slytherin table (Lily's idea) to avoid any 'accidental' food poisoning and joined Sirius where he sat alone for once. He grinned devilishly when he saw me take the seat in front of him.

""I see you grew bored with the overgrown bat."" 

I raised an eyebrow. ""Don't call him that. Severus is my friend.""

Sirius shook his head mournfully. ""Harry, darling. Clearly, you need help choosing better friends.""

I nodded as I scooped a generous serving of roast chicken and potatoes onto my plate. ""You're right. I'll go ask Severus who he thinks I should be friends with.""

""Very funny."" Sirius rolled his eyes before an excited gleam filled his eyes. ""James and Jenkins have been searching for you all day.""

I groaned. ""Can you tell them to shove off? I can't get a moment of peace with the three of you following me around."" 

Sirius took a drink of pumpkin juice before rolling his eyes. ""I'm just following the Captain's orders.""

""Oh, yes. You seem so put out."" I said, taking a bite out of my chicken. 

He ignored that in favor of asking, ""You ready for your first match?""

I nodded. ""Definitely. After Jenkins sees me play a real game maybe he'll finally bugger off.""

""Not likely. I've been on the team since my second year, and he still feels the need to give me a 'pep talk' in between classes evey once in a while.""

I grinned into my plate. Now that I could definitely see. Jenkins had a love and fierceness for quidditch that rivaled Woods. It will be interesting to see how he acts in the time before we step onto the pitch. It was nice beeng back in my element. Playing on the Gryffindor team again was something I had longed for durring the eight months spend hinting down and destroying horcruxes. It was the freedom of the air and the rush of victory that had me excited for what the morning would bring. 

Sirius and I sat in comfortable silence for a while. Soon enough dinner was replaced with desert, and I helped myself to a generous helping of bread pudding. The food at Hogwarts was second round none, except perhaps to Mrs. Weasley's cooking. The Burrow was one place it was impossible to stay hungry. At meals you were stuffed to the point of bursting, then given snacks to ""tide you over"" To the next meal. A wave of homesickness washed over me. The Weasley's had become family in the seven years I had known them. They didn't seem to care that I was the girl-who-lived, just that I was an overly skinny girl without anyone who cared enough to make sure I was taken care of. That first summer I stayed with them, Mrs. Weasley had made it her mission to help me regain the weight I had lost in the few months I had been with the Dursley's after the end of term. When school had begun again, I was a perhaps the healthiest weight I had ever been, though if you asked Mrs. Weasley I was still far too skinny. The twins had taken it upon themselves to teach me to pick locks the muggle way incase I was locked in my room again. It had helped make my time spent with my relatives more bearable whenever they felt I deserved to be punished. 

""Where's everyone else?"" I asked.

""James was still looking for you. He's convinced you've been hexed and left in a broom closet somewhere. Remus and Peter ate quickly so they could study for the Transfiguration test on Monday."" He explained. 

I 'hm'ed through my mouthful of pudding. 

We continued to talk about tomorrow and what type of strategies Jenkins would employ. We tended to disagree a lot in terms of how the Slytherins would play, but that was chalked up to my inexperience his eyes. In truth, this was the first time I was alone with Sirius. Normally James, Remus, or Peter were always there. I found that I enjoyed his laid-back nature as compared to how he tended to act before he died in my time. If I could somehow prevent Peter's betrayal, then this is the Sirius I would know during my childhood. Not the haunted man who had lurked in the shadows to protect me. 

 

The next morning I awoke feeling more refreshed than I had in a long time. For once I had felt comfortable taking a sleeping-draught from Madam Pomfrey. Any potential danger from overgrown snakes and mad diaries had taken a back seat to the excitement the match promised in just a few hours. Lily and a few of the other girls were painting Gryffindor designs on their cheeks while I pulled my hair into a high ponytail. It had grown out just enough to where only a small fringe of wild curls stayed against my neck. I thought about chopping ot off again, but Lily insisted I let it grow out. 

""If you let it grow, it should weigh down the curls enough to make it more manageable."" She had claimed. I was still skeptical, but didn't have anything to loose. Besides, it made Lily happy. 

I joined the rush of people headed down into the Great Hall for breakfast. There was an air of excitement about that was contagious. Everyone talked excitedly about the match, and quite a few people called put words of luck and encouragement to me. Somehow the food tasted even better as I sat with my teammates. Looking across the sea of students, I could see Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs dressed in either scarlet and gold, or green and silver. There seemed to be an even divide between the student body. It was far different from the future where most chose to support Gryffindor due to the belief that Slytherin was the house of dark wizards and witches. It somehow made me glad to see that in those time it wasn't the case. This was no doubt because the wizarding war had yet to take place. 

Peter plopped down next to me with a grin. He had taken ot upon himself to paint his entire face to resemble a lion with impressive skill. ""Morning, Harry!""

""Hey, Peter."" I greeted happily. ""Nice face paint.""

""Thanks. I had to show my support.""

Remus sat across from the painted boy with an amused smile. ""Did you show her the charm you put on it?""

Peter pulled out his want with an air of pride and pointed ot at him face before littering a spell. His face then morphed into an actual lion's head and let out a roar that startled half the Hall. Recovering from the sudden fright, I laughed in delight. Others didn't seem to take ot so well as they mopped up spilled pumpkin juice from their front and mumbled sourly. Peters face then returned to its normal painted stated. 

""I'm impressed."" I told the beaming boy. ""Where'd you learn to do that?""

""Remus helped me practice yeaterday after we finished studying.""

""He picked it up fairly quickly."" Remis told me fondly. 

""Alright team!"" Jenkins called over the chatter. ""Let's head down to the pitch.""

I made to follow as Remus and Peter promised to cheer the loudest for me. Lily hopped up and gave me a quick hug and wished me luck. I changed into my quidditch robes with practiced ease. My body felt jiddery with excitement. Knowing I was less than an hour away from bliss and the greatest adrenaline rush wizards had invented. Everyone seemed to share my excitement while we waited to Jenkins to give us his pregame pep talk. 

""Ready, Harry?"" James asked brightly. 

""I was born for this.""

""What did I tell you James?"" Sirius said, slinging an arm around my shoulders. ""Our dragon slayer will be fine.""

James sniffled. ""They grow up so fast.""

""Just imagine, our little Harry out there, all grown up and catching the snitch!""

I shook my head in good humor. ""All right you two, it's not my first go.""

""But this will be your first victory as a Gryffindor."" Jenkins said as he stood in front of the assembled group. ""And we will claim victory. We've trained harder than any other team and prepared for anything that might get thrown at us. Our house is counting on us for a flawless victory, and that's what we'll give them. Now let's go out there and win the day!""

We all let out a cheer, grabbed our brooms, and marched out to meet the Slytherins on the pitch. 

Whatcha think?

Hey, everyone. Wow it has been a hot minute. I would like to start with an apology. I am so sorry I fell off the face of the earth. It's been over a year, and I'm sorry to those of you who still follow this story. 

The past year has been super crazy for me. I moved states, work full time, and can you believe it, I'm pregnant. Yup, that's right. I'm currently 20 weeks along (halfway) and a complete mess. Nobody mentioned I would be sleeping all the time or any of the other wonderfully horrible things that happen. I'm also going to be a single mother, so I've been pulling over time to make sure I have money saved for maternity leave. 

Long story short, my bad guys. 

Now about this story. I will be continuing. I am, however going to heavily edit everything. For example, this story will now be in third person instead of first. More details are going to be added, and repetitive things will be removed. 

Thank you for your continued patience and support.

Blaine woke up with a smile on his face. He knew it was early, but today was his favorite day of the year. It was Christmas morning!

Blaine went to his closet to pull out the last of the gifts for his family. The TV he and Sebastian had got his dad from Walmart was too big to wrap, so he had put the remote in a box and wrapped that. He also had a bottle of perfume Sebastian had sent his mom from France and the cashmere sweater he bought Cooper. He knew Cooper would love it since the color matched his eyes perfectly. Blaine took pride in the fact that he was an awesome gift giver.

Once he had the gifts ready to go downstairs, he turned and paused to look at all of the photos on his dresser. The photos of his first Holiday Season with Sebastian. The first was one of the two of them in line waiting for Walmart to open. Then one of the two of them digging through the sock bins at Target. And a picture from later that day of the two of them cuddled in the big chair by the fire, asleep but wearing their new fuzzy socks.

There was a picture of the two of them in their Ugly Christmas Sweaters with the 1st place trophy next to the actual trophy.

And even though they had let it slip in the Walmart parking lot that they loved each other, Blaine made sure that he and Sebastian did all of the activities he had considered for being where to tell Sebastian he loved him.

Jeff had taken the picture of the two of them in the snow while sledding. His mom had taken a picture of the two of them kissing under mistletoe. And his favorite picture of all was the one he had taken when Sebastian got whipped cream on his nose while they were drinking hot chocolate.

Blaine picked up that last picture and gave it a quick kiss. He knew it was silly but he had missed his boyfriend since Sebastian left for Paris with his family. Blaine looked at his phone and considered giving Sebastian a call. After all, it was already afternoon in France. He was anxious to find out what Sebastian thought about his gift.

Finding a gift for a 17-year-old boy who has everything is kind of a daunting task, even for an expert gift giver like Blaine. Finally, he found a 100-year-old leather bound copy of Sebastian's favorite book, The Three Musketeers. In French. He was reaching for his phone when he heard movement downstairs. The call would have to wait a little while longer. It was present time!

Now, as much as Blaine considered himself an awesome gift giver he was not a good gift receiver. He had the tendency to put high expectations on what he thought others would give him and then would be disappointed with what he actually received. He really did overthink things.

This was why Blaine began to worry a little bit because he had not actually told Sebastian what he wanted for Christmas. He wanted Sebastian to know him enough for think of the perfect gift all on his own. Recipe for disaster, right?

Blaine was able to put his fears in the back of his mind for a while and enjoy the morning with his family. His parents got him the new computer he wanted complete with the latest in song writing and recording software. Cooper actually did really well too by giving him Maroon 5 tickets. Soon, there was only one gift left. His gift from Sebastian. He began to unwrap it carefully, but with great anticipation, and when he finally opened the box he found...

A bow tie.

A bow tie.

Sebastian gave him a bow tie. Well, the tie was striped and in Gryffindor colors. Maybe Sebastian thought it was a Harry Potter tie. He knew that Blaine loved the Harry Potter books. It's just like how Blaine knew Sebastian loved The Three Musketeers. Of course, he had given Sebastian a 100-year-old book and Sebastian had bought him a tie. A fucking tie! It's not that Blaine expected anything exceptional because Sebastian's family had money. But a fucking bow tie! He didn't really even wear them anymore since he returned to Dalton.

""Whatcha got there, baby brother?"" Great. Cooper. Brave face time.

""Sebastian gave me a bow tie in Gryffindor colors. He really knows me and my love for Harry Potter.""

""Oh, does he know?"" Cooper drawled.

""Stop being an ass"" Blaine's dad said to Cooper ""Show him the rest of his gift.""

""The rest of my gift?"" Blaine asked. Blaine felt so bad. There was a rest of the gift? He was such a bad boyfriend.

""Fine! Thanks for ruining my fun, dad."" Cooper brought out his phone and pulled up a video of Sebastian.


Hi Killer. First of all, I want to say I miss you even though I am making this video before I have actually left. I just know I will.  



I just want to tell you thank you for my gift. Not the one that is wrapped and in my luggage, although I am sure I will love it. I want to thank you for your gift of Christmas. These last weeks with you, seeing the excitement in your eyes whenever we did ANYTHING was amazing. I went to Walmart for you. I wore a Rudolph sweater for you. I stood outside of the mall and rang a bell while asking people for money for you. I drank an eggnog latte for you. Which by the way I will never do again. I went to a party full of New Directions to include your ex-boyfriend for you. But after a while I began to realize that I wasn't doing these things for you anymore. I was doing things with you. You showed me how to celebrate the SEASON B, and I will forever be thankful for that.


Blaine had to stop the video for a minute. He needed a tissue. He was such a bad boyfriend. How could have thought anything bad about his wonderful, wonderful Sebastian? Especially over something as materialistic as a Christmas gift. Blaine took a deep breath and restarted the video.


By now you have opened your present and are probably thinking WTF. 


Well, yeah.


So, what you don't know is that 3 days from now you and I have a date and you need to wear that tie on the date.


Huh?

Cooper stopped the video and his mom handed him another box. Blaine looked at his family and they were just smiling at him, so he opened the box and pulled out the piece of paper that was in it.

It was not any piece of paper. It was a ticket to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. In London.

Blaine had to smile. That bow tie Sebastian gave him was the Best. Present. Ever!
