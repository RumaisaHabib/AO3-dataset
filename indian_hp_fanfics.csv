Rowling,,"Harry Potter, Fleamont Potter, James Potter, Lily Evans","article, Discussion, Indian Harry Potter?, Headcanon",English,2020-11-02,Completed,2020-11-02,994,1/1,22,12,null,445,"['LookOutYourWindow', 'Aspen_Gray', 'Mibami17', 'Danceurlifeaway2', 'Coffee_Punk', 'Annadi']",[],"
These days I see a theory or, rather, a headcanon, which is getting increasingly popular - that Harry Potter is of Indian heritage. There are lots of artworks and fanfictions that describe him as Indian. I tried to find the origin of this particular headcanon, but failed. The only thing I found was that people of different races and nations want to see themselves being represented in their favourite books. I have nothing against this idea, but a headcanon can only exist if it doesn't contradict the information the author gave us. So, could Harry be Indian? Today we discuss.


 


According to the Internet, most people who think Harry is indeed Indian say that he got the heritage from his father's side, saying that the Potters were an Indian family that travelled to Britain and made a settlement there, or, in some cases, that Fleamont Potter (James' father) married an Indian woman. Could that be possible? Let's start with the first variant.


 


According to Harry Potter Wiki, ,,the Potters were, for many generations, pure-blood, until the birth of Harry Potter in 1980, but they were excluded from the Sacred Twenty-Eight due to their egalitarian stance on blood purity"". So, the Potters belonged to the Sacred Twenty-Eight, along with other wizarding families like the Blacks, the Malfoys and the Gaunts, who were direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin himself. That means that the Potters, as the other families mentioned here, were British aristocracy. Also on Harry Potter Wiki, we read: ,,The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Potterer', became corrupted in time to 'Potter'"". This means that the first Potter lived in the twelfth century, far earlier than India was colonised by Britain. What is more, the Potters are direct descendants of Ignotus Peverell, one of the Three Brothers in the tale of Beedle the Bard, and I am sure they were extremely proud of their family tree.


 


To sum up: the Potters are an aristocratic family, who are direct descendants of a famous British wizard and who were once included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight. What this means is that the Potters are British aristocracy through and through. They did not come from India.


 


Okay, but what about variant no. 2? Even if the Potters were British, Indian blood would overpower the white blood - this is simple genetics. So, what if Fleamont indeed married an Indian woman, whose heritage was passed on to James and, later, Harry? Well, I doubt it. See, James Potter was born in 1960, therefore, his father was born the latest in 1940. Harry Potter Wiki tells us he was born before 1909. Keeping those dates in mind, recall the Order of the Phoenix, where we get a taste of James' behaviour in school. I would assume his father raised him that way - he's a little spoiled, he's a bully, he's used to getting everything he wants, he's boastful - the list could go on. This reminds me a little of the way Lucius Malfoy raised Draco. Therefore, Fleamont was a true aristocrat, following the centuries-old traditions, and he expected James to be that way as well. I don't think that this, combined with the approximate dates of his life, could be characteristic of a man who would marry a woman of another race. At that time, a marriage like this would ruin the family's reputation. Moreover, it appears Fleamont was quite famous - still another reason to believe he married a British aristocrat like himself.


 


So, I think now we can all agree that, on his father's side, Harry couldn't have gotten his Indian heritage. What about his mother then? Let's tackle this as well.


 


As we all know, Indians all have black or very dark hair. No exceptions. Lily was a redhead. So, either she dyed her hair at such a young age (she wasn't even eleven when she first met Snape, and he described her as having flaming red locks), or she was simply white. However, some studies show that such strong blood (Indian, black, hispanic, asian, etc.) can wake up in a person long after the last descendant of this heritage passed away. Lily comes from a Muggle family, so we don't know anything about her ancestry... Right?


 


Wrong. We know Lily's hair is red. And what do we know about redheads? They are extremely rare. In particular, the gene that is responsible for having red hair is recessive (MC1R). This means that it has to be inherited from both parents for the child to have red hair. Petunia was a blonde, but this happens too, even if both parents have red hair - precisely because the gene is recessive. It doesn't mean that Lily's parents were both redheads, but if they weren't, they had to have had the gene in them - and even then, the chance of having a redheaded baby is just 25%. I won't go into depths here, as I am not a scientist, but in short, what this means is that Lily's family ancestors all had to have had that MC1R gene in them, therefore, they had to have been white.


 


And last but not least, remember that Harry's eyes are green. Could an Indian have green eyes? Quite unlikely - the probability of this is about zero per cent.


 


All in all, I think this headcanon contradicts the books. To have Harry be Indian we need to change at least one thing from the books, and this is just not right. We cannot go against what the author says, even if it's not clearly stated. We know that Harry's skin is a bit tanned, according to what J. K. Rowling wrote, at least. We cannot just disregard the opinion of the author, because she wrote Harry Potter and this is her world. Of course, I also like to have my own little headcanons, but they don't contradict such major things from the books.

The house was full with a delicious smell when Draco returned home that night. The stereo was pumping an addictive ballad that surely came from one of the CDs that James Potter had left to his son before passing away.



Draco took off his work robes and quickly proceeded towards the kitchen, mood already lightened just from the music and the smell of spices.



He found Harry at the stoves, a yellow apron on his front and a wooden spoon in his hand, moving his hips at rhythm with the music while putting ingredients in a pan from which big bubbles popped loudly.



It was a vision Draco hoped to come home to everyday.



""Hello?"" he tried to get Harry's attention, waving from the corner in which he'd stopped at to enjoy the view.



Harry's head raised almost instantly, and a big smile appeared on his sweating face. ""Just in time for the curry,"" he exclaimed, moving to take a plate and filling it with hot, dense orange liquid. ""How do you always do that is a mystery.""



Draco chuckled. ""I guess my instincts always tell me when you're about to go full Indian.""



Harry waved him off from his place at the stoves, and then pointed at the table for Draco to sit.



""It's just,"" Harry explained while approaching with the full plate, ""I've had an itch to cook this recipe for days. It's the summer version of my grandfather's curry, but I didn't even know it existed until I found the piece of paper inside one my mum's old books.""



Draco listened to him as he spoke with genuine interest about his family traditions: if there was one thing that Harry would never take for granted, it was what his parents had left him before dying - the possibility to have a decent life in the Wizarding World along with the discovery of his Indian roots. Harry was fully grateful to them for this.



""C'mon,"" Harry prompted him, ""taste it, let's hear what Draco Malfoy's royal palate has to say.""



Draco simply rolled his eyes, ""Promise you'll be better than any I've had before,"" he spoke to the plate, before taking a full spoon of the curry and putting it into his mouth, not caring about burning his mouth in the process. It was 

exquisite

.



He pointed his thumb up in an excited sign of appreciation.



""Yes!"" Harry shouted. ""I knew it!""



Draco smiled while sipping an entire glass of water in order to give his tongue a bit of relief. ""This time, you really exceeded yourself,"" he commented, looking at Harry's figure dancing in circles on the kitchen floor.



Harry stopped, winked at him and ""Only the best for you,"" revealed in a smirk.



Draco threw a napkin in his direction.

When a little muggleborn girl walks up to the Sorting Hat, a number of purebloods (and a number of muggleborns, to be honest) wonder why they can't see her hair- why her head and neck are covered by a dark blue headscarf.

---



Hermione Granger is faithful and studious. She hates breaking the rules and is a perfectionist. 


(She is also stupidly, irrevocably, wonderfully noble.)


In this universe, as in most others, Hermione Granger carries these traits close to her heart, in her spine and in her head. She holds faith in things that do not have a ready explanation, believes in heroes despite all evidence otherwise.



---



Hermione Granger finds a Summoning charm in her textbooks and figures it out how to perfect it before she even steps foot on the Hogwarts Express. If she is to complete her five daily prayers, then she will need a way to grab her prayer rug easily without having to carry it around all day (the Hogwarts blueprints show a school almost too large to be real- she'll have to investigate that).



She leaves her first class and her lunch block for five minutes everyday. She heads out into the hallways, summons Abba's prayer rug, recites a compass spell to orient herself toward Mecca, and recites her prayers.



---



This is not a story about heroes and villains. It is not a story about war and destruction, about magical spells and epic climaxes.



This is a story about the strength of a single girl's faith.



---



Hermione knows fear. She knows the way that people look at her hijab with suspicion, look at her father like he'll hurt them and her mother like she's stupid (despite the fact that they're both dentists, with their doctoral degrees and a wish to help others). She knows hatred, the way people sneer when they look at her and the way boys at her primary school would tug at her hijab, jeering names at her face.



She knows that Harry and Dean and Lavender and Anthony and Neville and the Patil twins all suffer from the same prejudice as she does, if for different reasons. 



When Draco Malfoy spits 

mudblood 

in her face, when he curses her origins, she calls upon the spells that she can run past her lips. She summons up a righteous anger borne of years of absorbing others' hatred, remembers pages and pages of spells. She whips hexes at prejudiced lips, smiles at the crunch of her fist against his face.



---



Hermione Janan Granger does not pray to flawed mentors and old men- she prays to Allah, and to herself. She is more than just a pawn, a fount of unfocused knowledge.



She wants to do good in the world, just like her parents, but she guards her trust close. She bestows it on those who have earned it- Harry, Ron, Ginny, Millicent, Anthony, Neville, Luna- but not on men who people seem to put blind faith in without proof. 



Her faith is strong, but it is not without base.



---



She makes friends with Anthony Goldstein, who celebrates Yom Kippur and Hanukkah and the Shabbat prayers with the same devoutness with which she practices her own faith. In a rather secular, magical world, being able to find someone else who puts such effort into their faith is relieving to her.



---



During Ramadan, her mind grows sharp and her spells powerful even as her stomach growls. Her focus increases as her hunger grows, as her faith finds its way past the limits of her stomach and into her bones.



Her dedication to her faith becomes known, and respected. During this month of the year, she is unbeatable even as her skin grows a bit sallow and her stomach grumbles during classes.



(She heads down to the kitchens after sunset and is greeted by a feast. She understands that, magically speaking, it fulfills house elves to provide food for her, but her faith does not abide by slavery of any sort. It is hard for her to process their smiles whenever she asks for food.



So, instead, she thanks each and every house elf, mentions them all by name in her prayers. Perhaps this will help them.)



---



When Hermione tells Harry, the orphan boy, the forced hero of the story, that they are all heroes, she doesn't mean that they are all saviors of worlds, leaders and princes. She doesn't mean that they have to save the day, have to be courageous and beautiful and in love.



She means that they are survivors, and that this, in itself, is a heroic act.


---




Her caftan for the Yule Ball her fifth year is modest and beautiful. A long dark blue caftan, trimmed with dark blue lace and embroidered in gold, it is just perfect. Her hijab is dark blue to match.



Viktor Krum looks at her and smiles. ""You look beautiful, sk'p.""



She smiles. ""Thank you, Viktor.""


 


Viktor Krum is nothing like the perfect Muslim boy she dreamed of as a little girl, but he 

is

 smart, and wonderful, and perfectly kind.



He respects her faith and her boundaries, calls her beautiful. He holds her hands, but does not kiss her. He is the perfect first boyfriend.


---


When she emerges from the lake, her hijab is sodden with water but thankfully still covers her hair and her neck.


---


Viktor leaves at the end of the Triwizard Tournament. Cedric won, Fleur placed second, and Viktor placed third. Despite his loss, he smiles and says, ""It vas vorth it, Hermione, because I got to meet you.""



Hermione returns his smile. ""It was nice to meet you as well, Viktor. We'll continue to write, right?""



He nods. ""Of course.""



---



Hermione Granger is not meek. She is devout, and focused on her studies, but not meek.



She is full of faith for many things: Allah, education, and herself. She channels this faith into progress, into change.


---


Harry comes to her at the end of fifth year, stomach in his throat. ""Hermione,"" he says, eyes downcast, ""I have something to tell you.""



""Yeah?"" she asks, raising her eyes from her book.


""I...I think I like boys and girls.""


She looks at him. She's suspected for a year or so, ever since his minor obsession with Cedric Diggory last year and the way he stares at Neville's arse sometimes.



""Okay,"" she says, and flips the page. ""Tell me when you finally ask Longbottom out.""



Harry sputters, and she smiles.



---



Hermione's sixth year, she breaks up with Viktor. It is an amicable split, no hard feelings between them. He wishes her luck with school and asks if she'll mind if he comes to celebrate her graduation next year.



She smiles and says 

of course not.




---



She walks into the Room of Requirement (a fascinating discovery when searching for an answer to Harry's Second Task two years ago) and finds Harry and Neville snogging in the middle of the Historic Legends section of the Great Hidden Library.



She clears her throat and they spring apart, looking like they've been caught doing something unspeakable. ""Mind handing me the copy of the 

Upanishads

, won't you?"" She gestures to Neville, who grabs a copy of the book that she's seen him reading on the 

Express 

and hands it to her. ""Thanks,"" she says, and heads over to the Muggle Sports section (the far end of the library) so she can read in peace.



---



Hermione graduates top of her class, Susan Bones, Draco Malfoy, and Terry Boot right behind her. 



The world is at her fingertips, and all of knowledge is within her grasp. She can change everything wrong with the world.



---



When Hermione Granger is eleven, she climbs a stool and puts a hat on her head. She is told that she will do well in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin, and she smiles.




I want to learn

 everything, she thinks, and the Sorting Hat shouts her House to the world.

It is the only space they can give themselves, in these days split neatly between anxiety and stolen moments of joy, all too aware of the war raging outside their door. It is all the home they can make, barely twenty-one with a child of their own that requires all of their attention. It's no wonder they find themselves clashing every so often, sleep deprived, cranky, and hurting from the loss of so many friends. It feels logical, in the moments between these great wars, between the clanging of knife sharp words thrust forth from mouths curved into angry smirks, that they should fight.

""My mother always said that if you agree with someone a hundred percent of the time, they don't really love you."" James admits, in a hoarse whisper, one afternoon. He has no idea where his parents are, hasn't received a single letter since they went back to India at his behest, shortly after he graduated from Hogwarts. He tells himself no news is good news because that's what he needs to hear. He always has. ""It's good that we're finding our limits. Our own, each other's... We need to know this stuff.""

""For what?"" Lily asks, broken glass words getting caught in her teeth. She's sure they'll come out speckled with blood, but they don't, falling harmlessly onto the too old carpet beneath her toes. She compromises, comes two steps down, the five steps between them a great, yawning chasm. Her toes grip the edge of her step, and she feels like she is standing on the edge of a cliff, nothingness in front of her, even if she does see him there, with his face turned up toward her, a sunflower seeking the light.

""We're going to be married a long time."" James says, solemn and determined. He puts one foot up on the next step, pauses as if testing the structural integrity, and then the other comes up to join it. His hand clutches the banister like a lifeline the whole time. ""Until we die. That's what you made me promise, didn't you?"" His grin emerges slowly, as if the sunlight of his smile is pushing away a thick curtain to shine through, crooked and adorable, dry, cracked lips pulling at muscles that have not been used in a long time.

For a second, Lily feels like the years between them and that final breath have been peeled back like the cover of a book, like it is eighty, or ninety, or a hundred year old James telling her not to be afraid without him. She can imagine the smile lines time will trace around his mouth, how the crinkles at the corners of his eyes will etch themselves into his skin, how she will love him even more when they are yelling at each other because it means he cares enough about their life, about her, that he wants her to see his way. She imagines Harry, all grown up, rolling his eyes at them as they get into it over how long to toast bread, lacing his fingers together the same way James does when he is pretending to listen.

""We both promised that."" Lily says. 

""Yeah."" James looks like he's drowning, something in his hazel eyes childlike in its confusion, adrift, unmoored, on a sea of doubt. She needs to touch him. 

She comes down two more steps, and he joins her there, sharing the middle ground. 

There's hardly enough room for both of them on the step, and he lays her down gently, the edges of the steps digging into her back. It would be romantic if it didn't hurt so much, but maybe that's part of the deal. She reaches out a hand toward him, smiles when James kisses the center of her palm before resting his cheek against it like a child, eyes fluttering closed in wonder and joy and a million other things, every one of them good and perfect. 

""I know we've been upset, but--""

""There's always room for being upset. In everything."" James interrupts lazily, opening only one eye and she laughs, an explosion of sound that's more snort than cute chuckle. His face is just so close to hers, and if anything, it makes what he's saying even funnier. ""Don't get all torn up about it when you were justified.""

""Fine."" Lily allows. ""If you'll be having none of that, then I've got nothing to say.""

""Oh, no apology then?"" He jokes, and she laughs again, watching mischief dance in his eyes. He's not angry, or at least, he isn't anymore. She'd known it from the way his hands had found her, always searching for something to do, something to hold. The fingers of his free hand are tapping restlessly against her waist, the other trapped beneath her body. ""So I tell you it's fine, don't worry about it, and you'll just take it as fact?""

""Oh, absolutely."" Lily jokes. ""I've got enough tact to fill a thimble and that's about it.""

""A thimble?"" James frowns. ""Don't those have holes? How can you fill one?"" He yawns. ""God, I'm tired just thinking about it. Philosophy's for people without one year olds.""

""You're assuming tact is liquid."" Lily says and James groans, batting her hand away like a kitten. ""If tact is solid and the particles are bigger than the holes in the thimble--""

""Evans, please, some of us are trying to exist painlessly here--""

""If the particles are bigger than the holes in the thimble--""

""I'll show you something that's bigger than the holes in the thimble."" James winks and Lily shoves him lightly, just enough to send a message. He rolls off her, taking a seat on the step the back of her head is laying against, and she takes advantage of the weight of him disappearing to scramble up into a seated position as well, leaning her head against his shoulder once she's settled.

""Technically, you can fill the thimble with tact. So there."" She sticks her tongue out. ""A successful analogy, no thanks to you.""

""Oh, I can also fill other things."" James says, because he's a monster, and a cheeky one at that, and Lily pinches the skin above his elbow, in the spot that always makes him howl. 

He does, predictably, throwing his head back, and she thinks of Remus, suddenly, of whether he'd crack a joke about lycanthropy if he saw James doing this. Sirius would be first to it, or he would've been, before the war -- the little she sees of Sirius now worries her. He's become someone else, someone guarded and angry and resentful, lashing out at whatever he thinks stands in his way, whether friend or foe, and calls himself right for doing it. 

Beside her, her husband complains about betrayal and hatred and pain with the same over the top dramatics she once hated, gently taking the offending hand in his own. He waits for Lily to come back to her thoughts, then kisses each knuckle one by one. 

""Back among the living, Evans?"" He asks, fingers tracing the line of her jaw before fluttering on down to her neck. He, wisely perhaps, doesn't ask where her mind's been. ""Nice to meet you. I'm your husband. You married me of your own free will.""

""Thanks."" Lily says, mouth dry. She feels like she's fumbling her words. The little flashes of joy have dissipated away, a sour aftertaste lingering in her mouth, and she wonders if happiness always comes at a price. If there is some inescapable doom lying in wait for them for daring to be in love, even when it's hard, even when it's inconvenient. 

Upstairs, their son continues to sleep. 

She takes it as a curse and a blessing.

""You're allowed to be upset."" He says, when he feels enough time has passed, and she clings to the words like he did the banister. Everyone thinks it is her that tests and hesitates and tests again, that slows life's rolling wheels to an acceptable pace, but it's him, all him, a jumble of delightful contradictions that she picks apart and solves piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle. ""Life is hard. Life is hard even without a war, and we've got one of those too."" He laughs, the sound hollow and booming, like an echo bouncing around an empty cathedral. ""Just talk to me. If I can fix it, I will. Till death do us part, right?""

""Death can try his best."" Lily spits, words dripping with vengeance and power, and James laughs, the sound almost musical. She loves his laugh, how he finds so much joy in her standing her ground. ""He'll have to go through me to get to you and that's a fight he'll regret picking.""

""It's all yours if you want it, Lil."" He smiles, eyes crinkling up at the edges, and she sees the future stretching out ahead of them, a rainbow hued bridge to something greater, something worthy of their love, at its best and worst and the collage of moments in between. ""The fight, and me, and Harry too. All of this."" His lips brush against her temple. ""We'll do what we can. All three of us. This is hard, but that doesn't mean it's not doable. Livable.""

""The same stands for you too."" She says, because she knows how he longs for his parents, oceans away (well, a sea and an ocean, if she's getting technical, but something tells her that, in this particular situation, the facts aren't any better than flowery words that stretch the truth here and there). Hers can write letters, at least, mail that Dumbledore makes her route through a chain of friends and colleagues and acquaintances so the secret of their location won't be revealed. They'd found out Dorcas had died because Lily's letter hadn't come on time, like clockwork, on the first of the month. ""If you need to talk, no matter how angry I get, or we get, I'm here for you too.""

""I know."" James takes her hand in his own. ""When we get out of here, when-- when-- when we get our own place and you become a Healer and I become-- I become-- well, whatever I become, things will be better. I guess we've just got to-- got to pretend that we're already there. Or that we're closer than we are. Optimism dies hard, I guess.""

""Well, it shouldn't."" Lily says stubbornly. ""Or you'll become like me, all old and decrepit.""

""You're two months older, Lily."" James rolls his eyes. ""See, that's the pessimism habit talking."" His breath stutters in his throat a second later, like he's afraid he's said the wrong thing, and she decides to take advantage.

""Oh, so I've got to change myself for you?"" She raises her eyebrows, tries to feign shock. ""Is that how it is, Potter?""

""As long as it's not my job, change away."" He fires back, without a care in the world, his whole body stiffening up instead of just his voice. The expression on his face is that of a child caught with both hands in the cookie jar, eyes wide and mouth set in a grim line, and she barely manages to avoid bursting into laughter. ""Oh. Um. Well, listen, Lily, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have-- It's insensitive, and--""

""Don't get all torn up about it when you were justified."" She parrots back, and he breathes out the tension in his body. She thinks she can feel it hanging between them like a cloud, charging the air with something electric. She wishes it would melt away into mist, nothing but a memory of this moment remaining. She wishes it would never come back. ""If I get to go easy on myself, you do too.""

""As long as I'm not in trouble, I'll take anything."" James smiles. As much as she loves him when they fight, she loves him more when they are done, this soft, delicate thing he becomes when the barbs have all been thrown and lie harmless on the floor, scattered about like their son's tornado of toys. ""So how long have we got before the little rascal wakes?""

""We're already living on borrowed time."" Lily says, with a cautious glance up the stairs. For all Harry's confidence, he's not as good at climbing down stairs as he thinks he is, and has an awful tendency to fall headfirst down a few steps here and there in an effort to match his parents' speed. For all his lack of balance, he's not fearful. She respects that. ""If he keeps sleeping now, he'll be up all night. I got him up in the morning, so it's your turn. Up. Go on."" 

James gets to his feet, all long limbs and creaking joints even at twenty-one, groaning as he places a hand on his lower back, bracing himself with his other hand on the banister before leaning back to crack his spine. ""That's it. Right there. God, that's good.""

""You disgust me."" Lily gags. ""Go, go, go."" She pulls herself up to her feet, reaches back to slap James' butt and ends up leaning too far back and falling on the landing. He giggles, from a few steps above her, teeth shining white in the evening light, and she falls in love again from this new vantage point, this new perspective. The day's last gasping breaths of sunlight paint his copper skin in a masterpiece of light and shadow, a work of art looking back over his shoulder at her, cocking his head to the right just so when she stares for too long.

""What's wrong, Evans?"" He teases. ""Captivated by my beauty?""

""Yeah."" She says, swallowing hard, and it takes him by surprise just like she'd anticipated, knocks the breath out of his lungs. She likes to win. ""Just a little.""

She gets back to her feet when he disappears down the hall to their son's room, climbs the few stairs left before her one at a time, each step measured and slow. She hears the door to the nursery creak open, hears her husband's voice swell around words in a language she doesn't know. She hears the quiet whisper of his hands against the sheets as he slides a hand underneath their son's body, lifting him up and out of the crib, the soft little whimpers Harry lets out as he's taken from his warm bed, before he realizes he's in his father's arms. 

She's in the doorway when her son opens sleep heavy eyes and notices her, his green eyes identical to hers under a cloud of messy black hair that could've only come from James. 

""Say hi to Mummy, Harry."" James waves Harry's hand at her and she must be smiling, because Harry lets out a delighted shriek that could practically rattle the windows. ""Tell Mummy you love her, Harry.""

""Mummy!"" He repeats happily. ""Mummy, Mummy!""

""There we go."" James bounces Harry in his arms. ""Shall we go downstairs, my liege? Or do you want to stay up here?""

Harry pats his own stomach, making a beleaguered face. ""Mumma."" 

Lily knows little of her husband's language, but enough to know that's the word babies are taught for food. She finds it a marvel of the universe that even in the midst of a war that could so easily take their lives, their toddler son is learning two languages and managing them both just fine, though he does often say things to her that she doesn't fully understand. 

Even in the cavernous darkness of war, children persevere. Children prevail. And their son, obviously, is the best of the best. Little more than a child herself, Lily is thankful for her son, for her husband, but most of all, for herself.

""A hungry boy."" James deadpans. ""All right, little prince, we can do something about that."" Father and son grin, identically, their noses scrunching up the same way as their mouths tilt in opposite directions. ""Ask Mum nicely if she'll come downstairs with us. Tell her I'll clean up your mess.""

""Down?"" Harry asks hopefully, pure, uncontainable glee in his smile, in the soft kicking of his feet, at the thought of going downstairs. ""Down, Mummy?""

""Let's go."" She says, and takes the hand that isn't at Harry's back when James comes through the doorway, and they come marching down the stairs toward their future in a tangle of limbs like Christopher Robin and Edward Bear, a picture out of a fairytale."

Bhamani...Satyabhamani...


Thinking of the energetic tempo of the music made a grin creep its way onto her face. Harini's moment in the spotlight was here. Of course, it had come many times before, but this time was special. This time, the song meant something else to her. The ebbing and flowing eddies of magic around her at every moment of the day were burning brighter in her presence. She shook out her hands and turned to look at herself in the mirror.

The eyeliner would've looked somewhat ridiculous in any other scenario, but right now, her eyes were expressive and nearly catlike. The heavy gold chain, the heavy earrings, the band cinching her waist, they were brilliant over the deep crimson fabric. Her hands were stained red with mehendi, and she tried to shrug off her excitement at the fact that the colour was deep and rich. Her braid was so long, and so heavy, with the flowers and gold hairpieces pinned generously in it. Padma's voice in the background alerted her to the fact that it was time for her to go on. She grinned wider. She had loved the spotlight, loved the performances since she was a little girl. Now, she would share that joy to others.

Her magic hummed, pleased. It was thrumming with positive energy, she felt like she could soar among the birds if she wanted to, but also as if she was walking on pins and needles.



Vayyari, muddula! Vayyari...Satyabhamani...Satyabhamani...


Krishna and his wife, what a story to tell. What a story for a lovesick girl to tell. Her teacher had been half-teasing and half-apologetic, she'd said that it was probably impossible for her to do the dance with the fullness of emotion, since she'd never been in love before. To everyone's surprise but her own, she performed beautifully. The depth of the emotion, 'a man and his wife', something she'd never been expected to do well, she'd potrayed as powerfully as she could've.

Bhamakalapam was the perfect piece for peacocking-after all, who didn't love saying that among 16,000 wives, they were the favourite-but even more so, it was one of the best ways to convey the multitude of indescribable emotions one feels when the person who holds their heart holds the hearts of others, and you can only hope that they treasure their possession of your love above all others. Every bit of that complex emotion, crashing and cresting in her like a storm, it shook the room when it radiated outwards full force. Threads of her magic searched the environment around her for even a whisper of wind that aligned with her patron, swirling around her like a foggy cloud of ribbon, cloaking her in a cocoon of a shimmering gold mist. Her arms, her legs, her back, all sore from the enormous physical effort of dancing like this for this long. She couldn't bring herself to care. 

No other euphoria felt like that. Nothing could capture the image of her feelings like that. As the beat pounded in her ears, as the band members sang and strummed and beat the tempo for her, the scene played out in her head. Fiercely possessive and beautiful, Satyabhama's song was a love letter to those who were willing to fight for their love. The crowd's low exclamations could be heard as the mist shifted, turning into the likenesses of the characters of that myth, all caught up in each other.

A cheer went up as she swayed off the stage, her heart raced, and she could barely hear her friends' congratulations over the sound of her pulse pounding in her ears. As she excused herself, dizzy from the rush of power, she reached out for the one person whose magic she'd longed to feel all night. 

As soon as Neville's magic touched hers, the dam keeping the magic from flooding out from her broke. It went whirling around the entire amphitheatre, bringing dead plants to life, putting colour into people's cheeks, rushing and giggling like a gale. She pulled his magic tightly against herself, wrapping it around her own rippling magical energy. The lehenga she'd been waiting to wear for so long was finally slipped on, and now it was simply a matter of finding him.

Harini's dupatta fluttered behind her as she ran, her eyes bright and her mind caught up in the emotion of the song. The thudding of her feet against the stone floors brought her closer and closer to him with each step, and she was frenzied in her search, clinging to his magic like a guiding star. Her bangles clanged and belled together, and for a moment all she could do was look at him. The chain round her neck had a tiger pendant dangling from it, and it shook softly in the hollow of her throat from the speed of her pulse.The tsunami of magic inside of her screamed to do something, anything. 

She felt her feet walking her to him.


His smile is so gentle.


She felt his magic tangle itself in hers.


He's never going to leave me.


Her hands reached out for him.


He didn't need to ask for my hand in bonding. 


She stood on her tiptoes.


He knew he already had it.


She hooked her arms behind his neck.


I trust him.


She gave him her maiden's kiss."

Thirty-five is old, for a wizard. Older still for an Indian wizard. Beyond inexcusable for an Indian wizard whose siblings' children are all within sniffing distance of double digits. It is not for lack of trying. 

It is certainly not for lack of trying. 

Your wife always looks tired these days and you've told her, in no uncertain terms, that this is the last go around. If this doesn't take, if there isn't a bouncing baby in her arms in nine months' time, you're not indulging this silly notion again. She has wanted this as much as you have, for as long as you have, and you feel like a villain, like a dictator, like you are bleeding her dry for some impossible future, watching all the love in the world you share wash over the floor in sorrow. You are done with watching love die a thousand grisly deaths at the hand of a god that knows no mercy.

You want to be happy. 

You want her to be happy. 

You want to be happy together.

There are plenty of ways to be happy without a child and you and your wife have been lucky enough to discover every one, little sunbursts of treasure hidden in the earth that you unearth, one after another, like little rest stops on the way to the greater pot of gold at the end of the earth. You are the second son (once the third, but not anymore) of a lesser Wizarding family, one that doesn't need more heirs (which correlates quite directly with more enemies, especially with all of you as outspoken as you are) now that your older (once the oldest, now your only) brother has a son.

A beautiful boy, with cheeks like apples and a smirk that could bring God to his knees. His eyes disappear when he smiles, and he smiles often and proudly, daring the world to not share his joy. You fall for him in a thousand new ways every time he comes racing up to your front door with a story to tell. He's got a room in your house, the innumerable drawings he leaves behind plastering the walls like wallpaper, and it looks like the aftermath of a hurricane because you'd never ask him to clean it.

You go look at the mess of his existence sometimes, a fond smile on your face, imagining a little person living in it full time, wading through the papers and crayons and relics of boundless jubilation. 

You imagine a little boy with your wife's eyes, and maybe your nose, and his cousin's knowing smile, racing little plastic cars around the perimeter of the room. You imagine a little girl, braids tied off with ribbons, with a set of watercolor paints she inevitably spills all over the carpet. You imagine yourself comforting her while you erase the evidence with a wave of your wand, imagine yourself holding her gently like the treasure she is. A little girl with plasters on her knees, climbing the fruit tree in your front yard. A little boy with his nose in a book, sitting on the kitchen counter. 

All these ghosts cover every inch of the house, a thousand children that could have been. Somehow you fill the empty spaces they've left behind by giving the love you would have given them (should have given them) to your brother's boy, your only hope, the closest thing you have to a child of your own. The closest thing you might ever have, and he's seven already. In four more years, he'll be away at Hogwarts. Seven years after that, he'll have his own life and you'll be left, bereft, all over again.

You taught him how to bowl a leg spin yesterday, made him watch you do it again and again until he felt confident enough to try himself, and then spent an hour sitting in the grass, watching him practice, determination furrowing his brow, until he could repeat it twice in a row, then thrice. He reminds you of yourself, eternally seconds from shrieking with joy, so thrilled to simply be alive, and you wonder if, someday, you will be lucky enough to teach your own child the things you lavish on your brother's. 

You cycle through the array of ghosts in this room alone, impose the faces and stories you've dreamed up for them on the grape hiding somewhere in your wife's abdomen. Maybe this one is a little boy that likes puzzles, solving all the problems in the world in between chewing up his board books. Maybe this one is a little girl that likes to play Quidditch. Maybe this one is a little boy with more friends than he can count, a little girl with a smile that could rival the sun. 

Maybe this one is the child that survives.

You are thirty-five and you are tired of being sad and by the time this baby comes, you will be thirty-six, which is uncommonly old for a first time parent, among wizards and Muggles alike. 

Maybe you were just never meant to be average. 

Maybe your child will be as special as their circumstances.

You are twenty and you're holding a baby. 

Your baby. 

He has your wife's eyes and pink, shiny gums for miles, and his little nose is just so small. 

You haven't seen too many babies in your life, but if anyone had told you they'd be this small, this fragile, you'd have balked at the idea of having one of your own. Maybe it was for the best, then, that you didn't know, that you assumed he'd come in neat, adult proportions, inflating himself like a balloon the second he was out in the world. You know, logically, that him growing up will take time, that a few years from now, between your personality and your wife's, he'll be talking so much that you'll miss today, miss a time before words and friends and tantrums, but you wish you could talk to your son now and hear him talk back.

You wish you could see understanding in his eyes when you tell him how hard the past two years have been. How you've seen friends and foes alike fall on the battlefield and each death in the Order, whether you knew them well or not, feels like an insult to the earth that nurtured them, the parents that raised them to do the right thing, the world that needed what they had to give. The world that will never get that. 

You have seen people ripped apart and bleeding die on your doorstep, have seen your wife sacrifice sleep at the altar of healing others, have seen far too much for your baby to ever comprehend. You know the feeling of waiting for news far too intimately, have received too many black envelopes from the Ministry, have felt each loss like a hot poker through your chest. 

You are still waiting on your cousin's body, all these years later, some small part of you wishing that he might be alive out there, might be waiting for you.

Here you are, holding this innocent, precious thing, and wishing peace into his heart. Here you are, with gentle hands and a gentler smile, a built in role model for this little boy that is going to see so vividly that the world isn't made to comfort him, to contort itself into a cocoon around him so he has time to become whoever he wants. You will be that cocoon instead. You will stare down death for this boy, who's currently sucking on your pinky finger, and death will lose.

Confidence is never something you've been short on, but maintaining it, especially lately, is a struggle. Remembering, in the depths of war, that you are sacrificing for a good cause is a luxury afforded to few. Money can only do so much. Status can only do so much. Blood can only do so much. You are terrified to bring this brilliant son of yours into such a world, but he's here now. All you can do is keep him here, succeeding where you never had before.

You waited for Neil to come home for three weeks before you gave up. And even now, it hits you like a hammer to the gut -- you gave up on him. You stopped waiting. You stopped sitting in the Owlery at Hogwarts, waiting for a letter that would never come. You haven't allowed yourself to give up on anything since, for better or for worse, and you hope your son will benefit.

It still feels like something is missing, even if you know in your heart that your cousin (your brother) is gone and never coming back, in every moment in your life. And now you miss him like a limb, the ease with which he'd declare all your worries pointless, the ease with which he'd remind you that you are uniquely qualified to love this little boy with everything you've got for as long as you can. You miss a world that never got to be, one where he steals Harry from your grip now, holds him close and tickles his little ears, tells him the same stories he told you. It's weird, mourning something that never happened. Neil is always going to be twenty-three and here you are, somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a half years short of the day your cousin died, with a child in your arms and fear consuming you whole.

You are in desperate need of reassurance, are projecting how much you miss your parents onto every single person you see. Frank tells you it's normal to feel like you're still a child yourself, like you need all the help in the world to this thing that should be natural, but Frank has his parents still. Yours are beyond your reach until this stupid war ends, and even then, they're old. You bear no illusions about how comfortable old age is -- part of growing up with parents carrying age old doubts and worries like yokes around their shoulders, slowly sinking further into the ground with each step. You bear no illusions about how happy theirs will be, with your child to brighten their days, either.

You've been called an incorrigible optimist in varying tones of surprise, dismay, and exasperation and you are proud of it.

""I think you're a miracle, Hari."" You trace the soft slope of his little nose. ""That's something we have in common, I think. My parents always said they knew I was special, the day I was born. I think you're gonna be special too."""

But he had already made up his mind. He was going too fast for Harry Potter on Karrwa Chauth. It's is a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima in the month of Kartika.

They had somewhat of an awkward friendship. Passing each other soft smiles as they walked past each other in Ministry. Looking for each other at ministry balls, even though they don't talk much but still keeping an eye on each other from afar.

It was the perfect opportunity, as Auror Potter, the Head of the Auror Department, and Minister Draco the Head of international relationship, were to invited the ball to Gujarat, India, along with other few members of the department. 

The ball was going to be held at a sanctuary to keep it enclosed from the muggles. Arrangements were made for them to stay there as well. The ball was on the same night as the festival. 

He already decided the best attire with the help of Pansy to wear on the ball night and the stuff he needed to break his fast was already arranged.

That morning Draco woke up before the sunrise to drink a glass of water as he won't get to drink any till night. He made sure to eat something that would last long throughout the day as well, as he had to make arrangements for the other guests arriving for the ball. 

It was no secret that Harry was pansexual. The world went upside down when Harry came out as a part of the LGBT community but the noise died down. 

""Any plans for tonight's ball?"" she nudged his elbow as he stood beside him. ""no, and don't you have a certain redhead to bother?"" he asked he checked the list of guests arriving.

""I do, but a certain brunette almost ate my brain asking me why the hell has Draco not eaten anything since the morning?"" she asked as she leaned in on her elbows and took the
quill from her hand.

Cheeks turned red he involuntarily looked at Harry with Ron who was seated a few tables away from them. He looked away as Draco caught him staring. He smiled and then looked down on his paper again.

""I have some plans,"" he said softly. Hermione sighed to herself as she watched the little scene unfold.

""What plan could possibly require you to starve to death?"" she asked as a matter of fact.

""you're smart Granger, you'll figure it out"" he smiled too sweetly, collected his papers, and left

Three hours later he returned to his room. it was still noon and he was already so hungry. As soon as he was about to close his eyes for a short nap someone knocked on the door. he groaned and got up.

""Weasley"" he regarded Ron.

""Malfoy"" he regarded back. Draco leaned towards the door. they also had an unusual friendship, not much close but he admired Ron. Especially his ability to play wizard chess.

""what do you want?"" he asked 

""we're going to the bazarre. Hermione wants you to join. No excuses."" He said with shrug. He knew denying Ron would only make the queen herself come upstairs to drag him down

""give me 5mins I'll be downstairs"". Ron nodded his head.

""took you long enough,"" said Hermione as she linked her arms with him. They hang out occasionally, and every time they do Hermione gives him a long lecture about how she could practically taste the sexual tension between him and Harry afterward.

""Sorry to keep you waiting your highness,"" he said as they all walked towards the main town. It was hot and if it wasn't for Hermione holding his hand he'd have already fainted.

Draco didn't let his fatigue show on his face but Harry still looked at him worriedly as they walked. Harry was always tongue-tied whenever Draco was around. He'd flush completely whenever they sat a little too close. 

He was such a gentleman to Draco that he had to calm down the urge to just snog the irresistible bastard right there in front of everyone. 

Draco looked back and saw Harry was just walking right behind, apparently checking out his ass. He hooked his fingers in his pants and pulled them a little up in an act to adjust them a bit, or really just highlight his ass more.

Harry tripped over his own foot and he looked up to Draco laughing at him. 

""Careful there, mate,"" said Ron. ""yeah,"" Harry said his cheeks turned red.

""c'mon I want to get mehndi, look how pretty their hands look"" she dragged Draco over to a small stall where a couple of Indian girls were applying Mendi on other women.

They sat on the empty slot. Hermione offered her hand to the man and he started to fill her hand with a beautiful design. The man in front of Draco looked at him warily, apparently not used to a man wanting to apply henna before.

He looked behind Draco and then immediately started working on Draco's hands. Draco looked behind him and saw that Harry was standing over him with arms crossed and a stoic face, the outline of his muscles clearly visible. Draco flashed him a smile and Harry returned it with as much sweetness. 

""I thought this would go along with your plans for tonight,"" said Hermione in his ear. Her smartness never ceases to amaze him. He surged with excitement that he forgot about his empty stomach.

They bought some souvenirs. Harry followed him like a puppy from shop to shop, taking every bag Draco purchased. Draco was enjoying it so much that he might have bought a few extra things that he absolutely didn't need just to make Harry work a little longer. 

When they got back to the hotel, Harry accompanied him to his room to drop the stuff off. 

""are you okay?"" he asked nervously.

""Yeah, why'd you ask?"" Draco answered. Harry caressed his nape in nervousness. Draco loved seeing him like this, the man can get the hardest criminal masterminds to open their mouth but in front of Draco, he was a nervous wreck.

""you didn't eat anything at the breakfast, and not even when we were out?"" he asked.

With a sudden wave of confidence, he said, ""oh, I'm fasting for you?"" he kept his tone nonchalant. Harry who mostly avoided looking Draco in the eyes, abruptly looked at him and stared before he could get his brain to function again.

""Wh... what? Why?"" Harry Potter stuttering, what would the Ministry say if they saw their precious savior like this. Draco smiled at that thought.

""yeah, I thought I'd do the wizarding world a favor by giving their golden boy a couple of extra years to live,"" he said as he watched Harry turn even redder if that was possible.

""meet me at the balcony after the ball Harry"" he stood on his tippy toes and leaned in to plant a soft kiss on Potter's cheek, carefully to keep his hands at a distance, and then walked into his room. 

Draco arrived at the ball at 7 pm, and as always he looked For Potter. When his eyes met him, Harry was already looking at him with wide eyes, Draco wore a red net Sari wrapped around his lithe figure so perfectly it looked breath-taking, and Harry did stop breathing until Ron kicked him in the foot lightly. The cut-sleeve deep neck blouse displayed his collarbones.

He walked towards Draco and offered him his hand. He noticed the Arabic mehndi on Draco's hand was so dark it was almost black. The fancy red bangles he wore made his hands looked so beautiful he never wanted to let them go. He kissed the knuckles and then tangled their hands together.

Harry was also wearing traditional Indian attire. A maroon red Kurta to match with black tight pajama and a scarf. His hair was a mess as always. His aura demanded respect in every room he walked not because he defeated Voldemort but because of who he is, which was just the perfect contrast as he walked towards Draco with a smile so bright it could outshine the sun itself.

Draco noticed that everyone was looking at him and he got a little self-conscious. Harry leaned in his ear and said, ""you look so beautiful Draco"". Draco flushed so hard at the compliment and the way his name on Harry's tongue that it made him forget his worries about any prying eyes.

Since gender-fluidity and equality were the hot topics in politics right now most of the guests encouraged him for showing the courage to break gender norms, some of them judged him but didn't dare say anything with Harry by his side. He didn't leave his side even for a second. Glared at anyone who got a little too close to Draco. He was absolutely enjoying the attention.  

 Draco saw Blaise walking towards, he was there to represent the American community in the wizarding world. Everybody knew that Draco was promised to Zabini by his father, but that world changed when Draco broke off the engagement when his father went to prison and proceeded to price everyone wrong who thought Draco will never be able to handle a position of power, including his father. 

 ""Potter"" they shook each other's hand with a tight grip. He took Draco's hand but instead of shaking he turned his hand and kissed his knuckles. ""you look lovely tonight Draco"" he said with a sharp smirk. Draco took his hand back with a tight smile ""thank you"" 

Harry felt Draco stiffen from Blais's gesture. he wrapped a possessive arm around Draco's waist and pulled him close. He rubbed soothing circles from his thumb on the naked skin which made Draco relax completely into him.

""I was hoping you we can discuss the American-British donation treaties after the party.,"" he asked taking a sip of his champagne. 

""it isn't much of a debate Blaise. Both the ministry decided that the fund will be going to the schools, instead of Zabini funds."" Draco replied with practiced ease.

""it's my money. I can take you to court for that"" Zabini's jaw tightened.

 Harry snorted at his statement, "" cmon Zabini we both know he'd smoke you in the court"". Zabini walked away. 

He also noticed that Harry wasn't eating anything either, ""why aren't you eating?"" he asked when they were finally done shaking everybody's hand.

""Didn't feel right that you weren't eating anything,"" he said casually as he shrugged his shoulders. Draco smiled so brightly that it almost hurt his cheeks.

He saw the moon was out in all its glory. He took Harry's hand and they both slipped away from the part. He brought them to the balcony where Draco conjured the things, he needed to break the fast.

""you know married people do this right"" Harry pointed it out. 

Suddenly embarrassed out of his wits, ""I... know that but it's not mandatory We don't have to-""

Harry cut him off, ""It's okay, I'll change that in a few years,"" he said with a cocky smile. Draco rolled his eyes but, but he smiled with relief.

Draco knew Harry was close with his family in India after the war so he knew how the custom goes. Draco read about it and he wanted to do it as it is. 

He picked up the sieve from the thali, looked to the moon through it, and then faced it towards Harry to secure its blessings.

""quit smiling you goof,"" he said because seriously his own cheeks were hurting pretty bad.

""I can't you look so beautiful like this,"" Harry replied. He circled the thali in front of Harry's face the agarbatti was already lit, its rosy scent only added to their environment. He prayed to every deity who would listen to him to wish all the happiness in the world to Harry along with a long and prosperous life.

Harry took the water from the thali and fed it to Draco. He stopped after drinking half and offered the rest to Harry.

Harry vanishes the content now that their fast is broken and kissed Draco passionately. He wrapped his hand around his slim waist and Draco moved his hands around Harry's neck.

Harry tugged Draco more strongly against him that it pushed the air out of Draco's lung in a gasp. He used the opportunity to explore the inside of his mouth with his tongue. He sucked on Draco's tongue which made him moan in his mouth.

Eventually, they break away for air. For a moment there's no sound except their harsh breathing and the clunk of Draco's bangles as he caressed his hair slowly. 

Harry was lost in the beauty before him, Draco's eyes were dark, lips all swollen and pink, and his cheeks were red. 

Draco's stomach made a demand, interrupting the moment and Harry burst out laughing.

""shut up, I hadn't eaten since last night!"" he whined.

""Sorry love, let's go feed you,"" he said as he walked them back to the party.

Harry vowed to himself to spent all his life plus those extra years Draco wished upon him to make him happy."

Summer break is over, and Neville's come to bring her home. It feels nice to think of it that way. The definition of home has changed multiple times over the years. Her chesire grin greets her older brother when she arrives. ""Annaiyya, are we leaving yet?"" Harry smirks at her fondly before chuckling, ""Calm down, your diwana isn't here yet."" She pinks at that, swatting his hand away from trying to pinch her cheeks. She walks away, feeling a flicker of annoyance even as she sends a mild stinging hex his way, and can't bring herself to be satisfied even by his starled yelp. 

Haru has yet to change into western wear, and can't bring herself to yet. This dress is the same glorious colour as Amma's hair, and it feels ever so luxurious and airy when she glides around a room with purpose. Harry on the other hand, has already changed into his robes, and her 'diwana' will be here soon. She debates changing, but decides not to. Potter crimson is a delicious contrast on her skin, and she looks and feels beautiful. 

Harini's slight embarrassment has yet to fade, but she still believes in the delightful phrase of 'showing yourself to your greatest benefit'. Maybe she's wearing it because she's comfortable. Maybe she's wearing it because it's a beautiful dress. Maybe she's wearing it because it's the same dress she wore when Neville helped her plant those roses around the pavillion in her private garden. Subconscious decision aside, it's beyond her.

It's a fluttery feeling to have someone described as your 'diwana'. Harini has had her fair share of admirers, but none that provoke her brother into teasing. She's fanning herself as she roams out onto the property, waving at the old family parrots and doves that have roosted in the banyan trees scattered around the estate. One of them, Krish, circles just above her head, long tail feathers waving behind him in that familiar shade of green. He pecks at her ear, nibbling and squawking out ominously. Harini tries to calm his fussing, until he screeches irritatingly close to her ears, ""Eagle! Eagle! Eat me!"" 

At the mention of eagles, Harini's eyes and head snap upwards with a reaction time the auror department would be scrambling to get their hands on. Sure enough, it's Neville's, and there is no time left to consider the whys and wherefores of dresses and parrots and infuriating older brothers. Gathering herself, she poises herself to greet Neville, only to find that she can't seem to find him. Harry has also rather mysteriously disappeared. The atmosphere seems ominous, and there is no noise for what seems to be miles, besides Harini's rapidly quickening breathing. 

Confused, she leaves the great hall accompanied by silence, roaming off to her garden to sigh in such a stereotypical manner that's almost embarrassing. Irritation is creeping into her again. It's so strange. Why can't it just be decent and uncomplicated? She stretches out her aura, trying to find any familiar magical signature. Faintly she can sense her parents and her brother, but Neville isn't anywhere she can detect.

She hisses slightly as she runs a finger over the tender flesh of her ear, nipped and bitten enough to be red. Why did Krish have to act up just then? Cursed timing aside, she focuses on the fact that she won't be seeing Krish again for another year, and tries to heal it quickly. Her magic begins to rush to the point of injury to heal her, but a voice murmurs behind her, ""Allow me, my lady."" 

Without turning around, she already knows that it's Neville. His fingers, roughened by years of gardening, are gentle when they run over the top of her ear, and without hesitating, they trail down to remove her earrings and replace them with a different pair.

Harini's breath hitches, and she can't bring herself to be upset with that bird and his antics anymore. It gave her a perfect excuse to come out here, and she can barely stop from pinching herself. Her fingers run over them, they're wild roses hammered out of gold, with rubies inlaid as petals, and tourmaline leaves that make a loop that closes in the back.

Her whole mind is occupied with the fact that earrings are a courtship gift, and that the comb she has in now is carved with roses.

Hours later, Krish gets a nice (if unwelcome) surprise, when Harini, who should be scolding him, does the complete opposite, and clutches the indignant bird in a breathtaking hug. Women (particularly the ones of this house), go by contraries, and this is one more problem that poor Krish will be forced to puzzle his wits over forever.

These days I see a theory or, rather, a headcanon, which is getting increasingly popular - that Harry Potter is of Indian heritage. There are lots of artworks and fanfictions that describe him as Indian. I tried to find the origin of this particular headcanon, but failed. The only thing I found was that people of different races and nations want to see themselves being represented in their favourite books. I have nothing against this idea, but a headcanon can only exist if it doesn't contradict the information the author gave us. So, could Harry be Indian? Today we discuss.


 


According to the Internet, most people who think Harry is indeed Indian say that he got the heritage from his father's side, saying that the Potters were an Indian family that travelled to Britain and made a settlement there, or, in some cases, that Fleamont Potter (James' father) married an Indian woman. Could that be possible? Let's start with the first variant.


 


According to Harry Potter Wiki, ,,the Potters were, for many generations, pure-blood, until the birth of Harry Potter in 1980, but they were excluded from the Sacred Twenty-Eight due to their egalitarian stance on blood purity"". So, the Potters belonged to the Sacred Twenty-Eight, along with other wizarding families like the Blacks, the Malfoys and the Gaunts, who were direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin himself. That means that the Potters, as the other families mentioned here, were British aristocracy. Also on Harry Potter Wiki, we read: ,,The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Potterer', became corrupted in time to 'Potter'"". This means that the first Potter lived in the twelfth century, far earlier than India was colonised by Britain. What is more, the Potters are direct descendants of Ignotus Peverell, one of the Three Brothers in the tale of Beedle the Bard, and I am sure they were extremely proud of their family tree.


 


To sum up: the Potters are an aristocratic family, who are direct descendants of a famous British wizard and who were once included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight. What this means is that the Potters are British aristocracy through and through. They did not come from India.


 


Okay, but what about variant no. 2? Even if the Potters were British, Indian blood would overpower the white blood - this is simple genetics. So, what if Fleamont indeed married an Indian woman, whose heritage was passed on to James and, later, Harry? Well, I doubt it. See, James Potter was born in 1960, therefore, his father was born the latest in 1940. Harry Potter Wiki tells us he was born before 1909. Keeping those dates in mind, recall the Order of the Phoenix, where we get a taste of James' behaviour in school. I would assume his father raised him that way - he's a little spoiled, he's a bully, he's used to getting everything he wants, he's boastful - the list could go on. This reminds me a little of the way Lucius Malfoy raised Draco. Therefore, Fleamont was a true aristocrat, following the centuries-old traditions, and he expected James to be that way as well. I don't think that this, combined with the approximate dates of his life, could be characteristic of a man who would marry a woman of another race. At that time, a marriage like this would ruin the family's reputation. Moreover, it appears Fleamont was quite famous - still another reason to believe he married a British aristocrat like himself.


 


So, I think now we can all agree that, on his father's side, Harry couldn't have gotten his Indian heritage. What about his mother then? Let's tackle this as well.


 


As we all know, Indians all have black or very dark hair. No exceptions. Lily was a redhead. So, either she dyed her hair at such a young age (she wasn't even eleven when she first met Snape, and he described her as having flaming red locks), or she was simply white. However, some studies show that such strong blood (Indian, black, hispanic, asian, etc.) can wake up in a person long after the last descendant of this heritage passed away. Lily comes from a Muggle family, so we don't know anything about her ancestry... Right?


 


Wrong. We know Lily's hair is red. And what do we know about redheads? They are extremely rare. In particular, the gene that is responsible for having red hair is recessive (MC1R). This means that it has to be inherited from both parents for the child to have red hair. Petunia was a blonde, but this happens too, even if both parents have red hair - precisely because the gene is recessive. It doesn't mean that Lily's parents were both redheads, but if they weren't, they had to have had the gene in them - and even then, the chance of having a redheaded baby is just 25%. I won't go into depths here, as I am not a scientist, but in short, what this means is that Lily's family ancestors all had to have had that MC1R gene in them, therefore, they had to have been white.


 


And last but not least, remember that Harry's eyes are green. Could an Indian have green eyes? Quite unlikely - the probability of this is about zero per cent.


 


All in all, I think this headcanon contradicts the books. To have Harry be Indian we need to change at least one thing from the books, and this is just not right. We cannot go against what the author says, even if it's not clearly stated. We know that Harry's skin is a bit tanned, according to what J. K. Rowling wrote, at least. We cannot just disregard the opinion of the author, because she wrote Harry Potter and this is her world. Of course, I also like to have my own little headcanons, but they don't contradict such major things from the books.

The house was full with a delicious smell when Draco returned home that night. The stereo was pumping an addictive ballad that surely came from one of the CDs that James Potter had left to his son before passing away.



Draco took off his work robes and quickly proceeded towards the kitchen, mood already lightened just from the music and the smell of spices.



He found Harry at the stoves, a yellow apron on his front and a wooden spoon in his hand, moving his hips at rhythm with the music while putting ingredients in a pan from which big bubbles popped loudly.



It was a vision Draco hoped to come home to everyday.



""Hello?"" he tried to get Harry's attention, waving from the corner in which he'd stopped at to enjoy the view.



Harry's head raised almost instantly, and a big smile appeared on his sweating face. ""Just in time for the curry,"" he exclaimed, moving to take a plate and filling it with hot, dense orange liquid. ""How do you always do that is a mystery.""



Draco chuckled. ""I guess my instincts always tell me when you're about to go full Indian.""



Harry waved him off from his place at the stoves, and then pointed at the table for Draco to sit.



""It's just,"" Harry explained while approaching with the full plate, ""I've had an itch to cook this recipe for days. It's the summer version of my grandfather's curry, but I didn't even know it existed until I found the piece of paper inside one my mum's old books.""



Draco listened to him as he spoke with genuine interest about his family traditions: if there was one thing that Harry would never take for granted, it was what his parents had left him before dying - the possibility to have a decent life in the Wizarding World along with the discovery of his Indian roots. Harry was fully grateful to them for this.



""C'mon,"" Harry prompted him, ""taste it, let's hear what Draco Malfoy's royal palate has to say.""



Draco simply rolled his eyes, ""Promise you'll be better than any I've had before,"" he spoke to the plate, before taking a full spoon of the curry and putting it into his mouth, not caring about burning his mouth in the process. It was 

exquisite

.



He pointed his thumb up in an excited sign of appreciation.



""Yes!"" Harry shouted. ""I knew it!""



Draco smiled while sipping an entire glass of water in order to give his tongue a bit of relief. ""This time, you really exceeded yourself,"" he commented, looking at Harry's figure dancing in circles on the kitchen floor.



Harry stopped, winked at him and ""Only the best for you,"" revealed in a smirk.



Draco threw a napkin in his direction.

When a little muggleborn girl walks up to the Sorting Hat, a number of purebloods (and a number of muggleborns, to be honest) wonder why they can't see her hair- why her head and neck are covered by a dark blue headscarf.

Hermione Granger is faithful and studious. She hates breaking the rules and is a perfectionist. 


(She is also stupidly, irrevocably, wonderfully noble.)


In this universe, as in most others, Hermione Granger carries these traits close to her heart, in her spine and in her head. She holds faith in things that do not have a ready explanation, believes in heroes despite all evidence otherwise.



---



Hermione Granger finds a Summoning charm in her textbooks and figures it out how to perfect it before she even steps foot on the Hogwarts Express. If she is to complete her five daily prayers, then she will need a way to grab her prayer rug easily without having to carry it around all day (the Hogwarts blueprints show a school almost too large to be real- she'll have to investigate that).



She leaves her first class and her lunch block for five minutes everyday. She heads out into the hallways, summons Abba's prayer rug, recites a compass spell to orient herself toward Mecca, and recites her prayers.



---



This is not a story about heroes and villains. It is not a story about war and destruction, about magical spells and epic climaxes.



This is a story about the strength of a single girl's faith.



---



Hermione knows fear. She knows the way that people look at her hijab with suspicion, look at her father like he'll hurt them and her mother like she's stupid (despite the fact that they're both dentists, with their doctoral degrees and a wish to help others). She knows hatred, the way people sneer when they look at her and the way boys at her primary school would tug at her hijab, jeering names at her face.



She knows that Harry and Dean and Lavender and Anthony and Neville and the Patil twins all suffer from the same prejudice as she does, if for different reasons. 



When Draco Malfoy spits 

mudblood 

in her face, when he curses her origins, she calls upon the spells that she can run past her lips. She summons up a righteous anger borne of years of absorbing others' hatred, remembers pages and pages of spells. She whips hexes at prejudiced lips, smiles at the crunch of her fist against his face.



---



Hermione Janan Granger does not pray to flawed mentors and old men- she prays to Allah, and to herself. She is more than just a pawn, a fount of unfocused knowledge.



She wants to do good in the world, just like her parents, but she guards her trust close. She bestows it on those who have earned it- Harry, Ron, Ginny, Millicent, Anthony, Neville, Luna- but not on men who people seem to put blind faith in without proof. 



Her faith is strong, but it is not without base.



---



She makes friends with Anthony Goldstein, who celebrates Yom Kippur and Hanukkah and the Shabbat prayers with the same devoutness with which she practices her own faith. In a rather secular, magical world, being able to find someone else who puts such effort into their faith is relieving to her.



---



During Ramadan, her mind grows sharp and her spells powerful even as her stomach growls. Her focus increases as her hunger grows, as her faith finds its way past the limits of her stomach and into her bones.



Her dedication to her faith becomes known, and respected. During this month of the year, she is unbeatable even as her skin grows a bit sallow and her stomach grumbles during classes.



(She heads down to the kitchens after sunset and is greeted by a feast. She understands that, magically speaking, it fulfills house elves to provide food for her, but her faith does not abide by slavery of any sort. It is hard for her to process their smiles whenever she asks for food.



So, instead, she thanks each and every house elf, mentions them all by name in her prayers. Perhaps this will help them.)



---



When Hermione tells Harry, the orphan boy, the forced hero of the story, that they are all heroes, she doesn't mean that they are all saviors of worlds, leaders and princes. She doesn't mean that they have to save the day, have to be courageous and beautiful and in love.



She means that they are survivors, and that this, in itself, is a heroic act.

Her caftan for the Yule Ball her fifth year is modest and beautiful. A long dark blue caftan, trimmed with dark blue lace and embroidered in gold, it is just perfect. Her hijab is dark blue to match.



Viktor Krum looks at her and smiles. ""You look beautiful, sk'p.""



She smiles. ""Thank you, Viktor.""


 


Viktor Krum is nothing like the perfect Muslim boy she dreamed of as a little girl, but he 

is

 smart, and wonderful, and perfectly kind.



He respects her faith and her boundaries, calls her beautiful. He holds her hands, but does not kiss her. He is the perfect first boyfriend.


---


When she emerges from the lake, her hijab is sodden with water but thankfully still covers her hair and her neck.


---


Viktor leaves at the end of the Triwizard Tournament. Cedric won, Fleur placed second, and Viktor placed third. Despite his loss, he smiles and says, ""It vas vorth it, Hermione, because I got to meet you.""



Hermione returns his smile. ""It was nice to meet you as well, Viktor. We'll continue to write, right?""



He nods. ""Of course.""



---



Hermione Granger is not meek. She is devout, and focused on her studies, but not meek.



She is full of faith for many things: Allah, education, and herself. She channels this faith into progress, into change.


---


Harry comes to her at the end of fifth year, stomach in his throat. ""Hermione,"" he says, eyes downcast, ""I have something to tell you.""



""Yeah?"" she asks, raising her eyes from her book.


""I...I think I like boys and girls.""


She looks at him. She's suspected for a year or so, ever since his minor obsession with Cedric Diggory last year and the way he stares at Neville's arse sometimes.



""Okay,"" she says, and flips the page. ""Tell me when you finally ask Longbottom out.""



Harry sputters, and she smiles.



---



Hermione's sixth year, she breaks up with Viktor. It is an amicable split, no hard feelings between them. He wishes her luck with school and asks if she'll mind if he comes to celebrate her graduation next year.



She smiles and says 

of course not.




---



She walks into the Room of Requirement (a fascinating discovery when searching for an answer to Harry's Second Task two years ago) and finds Harry and Neville snogging in the middle of the Historic Legends section of the Great Hidden Library.



She clears her throat and they spring apart, looking like they've been caught doing something unspeakable. ""Mind handing me the copy of the 

Upanishads

, won't you?"" She gestures to Neville, who grabs a copy of the book that she's seen him reading on the 

Express 

and hands it to her. ""Thanks,"" she says, and heads over to the Muggle Sports section (the far end of the library) so she can read in peace.



---



Hermione graduates top of her class, Susan Bones, Draco Malfoy, and Terry Boot right behind her. 



The world is at her fingertips, and all of knowledge is within her grasp. She can change everything wrong with the world.



---



When Hermione Granger is eleven, she climbs a stool and puts a hat on her head. She is told that she will do well in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin, and she smiles.




I want to learn

 everything, she thinks, and the Sorting Hat shouts her House to the world.

It is the only space they can give themselves, in these days split neatly between anxiety and stolen moments of joy, all too aware of the war raging outside their door. It is all the home they can make, barely twenty-one with a child of their own that requires all of their attention. It's no wonder they find themselves clashing every so often, sleep deprived, cranky, and hurting from the loss of so many friends. It feels logical, in the moments between these great wars, between the clanging of knife sharp words thrust forth from mouths curved into angry smirks, that they should fight.

""My mother always said that if you agree with someone a hundred percent of the time, they don't really love you."" James admits, in a hoarse whisper, one afternoon. He has no idea where his parents are, hasn't received a single letter since they went back to India at his behest, shortly after he graduated from Hogwarts. He tells himself no news is good news because that's what he needs to hear. He always has. ""It's good that we're finding our limits. Our own, each other's... We need to know this stuff.""

""For what?"" Lily asks, broken glass words getting caught in her teeth. She's sure they'll come out speckled with blood, but they don't, falling harmlessly onto the too old carpet beneath her toes. She compromises, comes two steps down, the five steps between them a great, yawning chasm. Her toes grip the edge of her step, and she feels like she is standing on the edge of a cliff, nothingness in front of her, even if she does see him there, with his face turned up toward her, a sunflower seeking the light.

""We're going to be married a long time."" James says, solemn and determined. He puts one foot up on the next step, pauses as if testing the structural integrity, and then the other comes up to join it. His hand clutches the banister like a lifeline the whole time. ""Until we die. That's what you made me promise, didn't you?"" His grin emerges slowly, as if the sunlight of his smile is pushing away a thick curtain to shine through, crooked and adorable, dry, cracked lips pulling at muscles that have not been used in a long time.

For a second, Lily feels like the years between them and that final breath have been peeled back like the cover of a book, like it is eighty, or ninety, or a hundred year old James telling her not to be afraid without him. She can imagine the smile lines time will trace around his mouth, how the crinkles at the corners of his eyes will etch themselves into his skin, how she will love him even more when they are yelling at each other because it means he cares enough about their life, about her, that he wants her to see his way. She imagines Harry, all grown up, rolling his eyes at them as they get into it over how long to toast bread, lacing his fingers together the same way James does when he is pretending to listen.

""We both promised that."" Lily says. 

""Yeah."" James looks like he's drowning, something in his hazel eyes childlike in its confusion, adrift, unmoored, on a sea of doubt. She needs to touch him. 

She comes down two more steps, and he joins her there, sharing the middle ground. 

There's hardly enough room for both of them on the step, and he lays her down gently, the edges of the steps digging into her back. It would be romantic if it didn't hurt so much, but maybe that's part of the deal. She reaches out a hand toward him, smiles when James kisses the center of her palm before resting his cheek against it like a child, eyes fluttering closed in wonder and joy and a million other things, every one of them good and perfect. 

""I know we've been upset, but--""

""There's always room for being upset. In everything."" James interrupts lazily, opening only one eye and she laughs, an explosion of sound that's more snort than cute chuckle. His face is just so close to hers, and if anything, it makes what he's saying even funnier. ""Don't get all torn up about it when you were justified.""

""Fine."" Lily allows. ""If you'll be having none of that, then I've got nothing to say.""

""Oh, no apology then?"" He jokes, and she laughs again, watching mischief dance in his eyes. He's not angry, or at least, he isn't anymore. She'd known it from the way his hands had found her, always searching for something to do, something to hold. The fingers of his free hand are tapping restlessly against her waist, the other trapped beneath her body. ""So I tell you it's fine, don't worry about it, and you'll just take it as fact?""

""Oh, absolutely."" Lily jokes. ""I've got enough tact to fill a thimble and that's about it.""

""A thimble?"" James frowns. ""Don't those have holes? How can you fill one?"" He yawns. ""God, I'm tired just thinking about it. Philosophy's for people without one year olds.""

""You're assuming tact is liquid."" Lily says and James groans, batting her hand away like a kitten. ""If tact is solid and the particles are bigger than the holes in the thimble--""

""Evans, please, some of us are trying to exist painlessly here--""

""If the particles are bigger than the holes in the thimble--""

""I'll show you something that's bigger than the holes in the thimble."" James winks and Lily shoves him lightly, just enough to send a message. He rolls off her, taking a seat on the step the back of her head is laying against, and she takes advantage of the weight of him disappearing to scramble up into a seated position as well, leaning her head against his shoulder once she's settled.

""Technically, you can fill the thimble with tact. So there."" She sticks her tongue out. ""A successful analogy, no thanks to you.""

""Oh, I can also fill other things."" James says, because he's a monster, and a cheeky one at that, and Lily pinches the skin above his elbow, in the spot that always makes him howl. 

He does, predictably, throwing his head back, and she thinks of Remus, suddenly, of whether he'd crack a joke about lycanthropy if he saw James doing this. Sirius would be first to it, or he would've been, before the war -- the little she sees of Sirius now worries her. He's become someone else, someone guarded and angry and resentful, lashing out at whatever he thinks stands in his way, whether friend or foe, and calls himself right for doing it. 

Beside her, her husband complains about betrayal and hatred and pain with the same over the top dramatics she once hated, gently taking the offending hand in his own. He waits for Lily to come back to her thoughts, then kisses each knuckle one by one. 

""Back among the living, Evans?"" He asks, fingers tracing the line of her jaw before fluttering on down to her neck. He, wisely perhaps, doesn't ask where her mind's been. ""Nice to meet you. I'm your husband. You married me of your own free will.""

""Thanks."" Lily says, mouth dry. She feels like she's fumbling her words. The little flashes of joy have dissipated away, a sour aftertaste lingering in her mouth, and she wonders if happiness always comes at a price. If there is some inescapable doom lying in wait for them for daring to be in love, even when it's hard, even when it's inconvenient. 

Upstairs, their son continues to sleep. 

She takes it as a curse and a blessing.

""You're allowed to be upset."" He says, when he feels enough time has passed, and she clings to the words like he did the banister. Everyone thinks it is her that tests and hesitates and tests again, that slows life's rolling wheels to an acceptable pace, but it's him, all him, a jumble of delightful contradictions that she picks apart and solves piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle. ""Life is hard. Life is hard even without a war, and we've got one of those too."" He laughs, the sound hollow and booming, like an echo bouncing around an empty cathedral. ""Just talk to me. If I can fix it, I will. Till death do us part, right?""

""Death can try his best."" Lily spits, words dripping with vengeance and power, and James laughs, the sound almost musical. She loves his laugh, how he finds so much joy in her standing her ground. ""He'll have to go through me to get to you and that's a fight he'll regret picking.""

""It's all yours if you want it, Lil."" He smiles, eyes crinkling up at the edges, and she sees the future stretching out ahead of them, a rainbow hued bridge to something greater, something worthy of their love, at its best and worst and the collage of moments in between. ""The fight, and me, and Harry too. All of this."" His lips brush against her temple. ""We'll do what we can. All three of us. This is hard, but that doesn't mean it's not doable. Livable.""

""The same stands for you too."" She says, because she knows how he longs for his parents, oceans away (well, a sea and an ocean, if she's getting technical, but something tells her that, in this particular situation, the facts aren't any better than flowery words that stretch the truth here and there). Hers can write letters, at least, mail that Dumbledore makes her route through a chain of friends and colleagues and acquaintances so the secret of their location won't be revealed. They'd found out Dorcas had died because Lily's letter hadn't come on time, like clockwork, on the first of the month. ""If you need to talk, no matter how angry I get, or we get, I'm here for you too.""

""I know."" James takes her hand in his own. ""When we get out of here, when-- when-- when we get our own place and you become a Healer and I become-- I become-- well, whatever I become, things will be better. I guess we've just got to-- got to pretend that we're already there. Or that we're closer than we are. Optimism dies hard, I guess.""

""Well, it shouldn't."" Lily says stubbornly. ""Or you'll become like me, all old and decrepit.""

""You're two months older, Lily."" James rolls his eyes. ""See, that's the pessimism habit talking."" His breath stutters in his throat a second later, like he's afraid he's said the wrong thing, and she decides to take advantage.

""Oh, so I've got to change myself for you?"" She raises her eyebrows, tries to feign shock. ""Is that how it is, Potter?""

""As long as it's not my job, change away."" He fires back, without a care in the world, his whole body stiffening up instead of just his voice. The expression on his face is that of a child caught with both hands in the cookie jar, eyes wide and mouth set in a grim line, and she barely manages to avoid bursting into laughter. ""Oh. Um. Well, listen, Lily, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have-- It's insensitive, and--""

""Don't get all torn up about it when you were justified."" She parrots back, and he breathes out the tension in his body. She thinks she can feel it hanging between them like a cloud, charging the air with something electric. She wishes it would melt away into mist, nothing but a memory of this moment remaining. She wishes it would never come back. ""If I get to go easy on myself, you do too.""

""As long as I'm not in trouble, I'll take anything."" James smiles. As much as she loves him when they fight, she loves him more when they are done, this soft, delicate thing he becomes when the barbs have all been thrown and lie harmless on the floor, scattered about like their son's tornado of toys. ""So how long have we got before the little rascal wakes?""

""We're already living on borrowed time."" Lily says, with a cautious glance up the stairs. For all Harry's confidence, he's not as good at climbing down stairs as he thinks he is, and has an awful tendency to fall headfirst down a few steps here and there in an effort to match his parents' speed. For all his lack of balance, he's not fearful. She respects that. ""If he keeps sleeping now, he'll be up all night. I got him up in the morning, so it's your turn. Up. Go on."" 

James gets to his feet, all long limbs and creaking joints even at twenty-one, groaning as he places a hand on his lower back, bracing himself with his other hand on the banister before leaning back to crack his spine. ""That's it. Right there. God, that's good.""

""You disgust me."" Lily gags. ""Go, go, go."" She pulls herself up to her feet, reaches back to slap James' butt and ends up leaning too far back and falling on the landing. He giggles, from a few steps above her, teeth shining white in the evening light, and she falls in love again from this new vantage point, this new perspective. The day's last gasping breaths of sunlight paint his copper skin in a masterpiece of light and shadow, a work of art looking back over his shoulder at her, cocking his head to the right just so when she stares for too long.

""What's wrong, Evans?"" He teases. ""Captivated by my beauty?""

""Yeah."" She says, swallowing hard, and it takes him by surprise just like she'd anticipated, knocks the breath out of his lungs. She likes to win. ""Just a little.""

She gets back to her feet when he disappears down the hall to their son's room, climbs the few stairs left before her one at a time, each step measured and slow. She hears the door to the nursery creak open, hears her husband's voice swell around words in a language she doesn't know. She hears the quiet whisper of his hands against the sheets as he slides a hand underneath their son's body, lifting him up and out of the crib, the soft little whimpers Harry lets out as he's taken from his warm bed, before he realizes he's in his father's arms. 

She's in the doorway when her son opens sleep heavy eyes and notices her, his green eyes identical to hers under a cloud of messy black hair that could've only come from James. 

""Say hi to Mummy, Harry."" James waves Harry's hand at her and she must be smiling, because Harry lets out a delighted shriek that could practically rattle the windows. ""Tell Mummy you love her, Harry.""

""Mummy!"" He repeats happily. ""Mummy, Mummy!""

""There we go."" James bounces Harry in his arms. ""Shall we go downstairs, my liege? Or do you want to stay up here?""

Harry pats his own stomach, making a beleaguered face. ""Mumma."" 

Lily knows little of her husband's language, but enough to know that's the word babies are taught for food. She finds it a marvel of the universe that even in the midst of a war that could so easily take their lives, their toddler son is learning two languages and managing them both just fine, though he does often say things to her that she doesn't fully understand. 

Even in the cavernous darkness of war, children persevere. Children prevail. And their son, obviously, is the best of the best. Little more than a child herself, Lily is thankful for her son, for her husband, but most of all, for herself.

""A hungry boy."" James deadpans. ""All right, little prince, we can do something about that."" Father and son grin, identically, their noses scrunching up the same way as their mouths tilt in opposite directions. ""Ask Mum nicely if she'll come downstairs with us. Tell her I'll clean up your mess.""

""Down?"" Harry asks hopefully, pure, uncontainable glee in his smile, in the soft kicking of his feet, at the thought of going downstairs. ""Down, Mummy?""

""Let's go."" She says, and takes the hand that isn't at Harry's back when James comes through the doorway, and they come marching down the stairs toward their future in a tangle of limbs like Christopher Robin and Edward Bear, a picture out of a fairytale."

Bhamani...Satyabhamani...


Thinking of the energetic tempo of the music made a grin creep its way onto her face. Harini's moment in the spotlight was here. Of course, it had come many times before, but this time was special. This time, the song meant something else to her. The ebbing and flowing eddies of magic around her at every moment of the day were burning brighter in her presence. She shook out her hands and turned to look at herself in the mirror.

The eyeliner would've looked somewhat ridiculous in any other scenario, but right now, her eyes were expressive and nearly catlike. The heavy gold chain, the heavy earrings, the band cinching her waist, they were brilliant over the deep crimson fabric. Her hands were stained red with mehendi, and she tried to shrug off her excitement at the fact that the colour was deep and rich. Her braid was so long, and so heavy, with the flowers and gold hairpieces pinned generously in it. Padma's voice in the background alerted her to the fact that it was time for her to go on. She grinned wider. She had loved the spotlight, loved the performances since she was a little girl. Now, she would share that joy to others.

Her magic hummed, pleased. It was thrumming with positive energy, she felt like she could soar among the birds if she wanted to, but also as if she was walking on pins and needles.



Vayyari, muddula! Vayyari...Satyabhamani...Satyabhamani...


Krishna and his wife, what a story to tell. What a story for a lovesick girl to tell. Her teacher had been half-teasing and half-apologetic, she'd said that it was probably impossible for her to do the dance with the fullness of emotion, since she'd never been in love before. To everyone's surprise but her own, she performed beautifully. The depth of the emotion, 'a man and his wife', something she'd never been expected to do well, she'd potrayed as powerfully as she could've.

Bhamakalapam was the perfect piece for peacocking-after all, who didn't love saying that among 16,000 wives, they were the favourite-but even more so, it was one of the best ways to convey the multitude of indescribable emotions one feels when the person who holds their heart holds the hearts of others, and you can only hope that they treasure their possession of your love above all others. Every bit of that complex emotion, crashing and cresting in her like a storm, it shook the room when it radiated outwards full force. Threads of her magic searched the environment around her for even a whisper of wind that aligned with her patron, swirling around her like a foggy cloud of ribbon, cloaking her in a cocoon of a shimmering gold mist. Her arms, her legs, her back, all sore from the enormous physical effort of dancing like this for this long. She couldn't bring herself to care. 

No other euphoria felt like that. Nothing could capture the image of her feelings like that. As the beat pounded in her ears, as the band members sang and strummed and beat the tempo for her, the scene played out in her head. Fiercely possessive and beautiful, Satyabhama's song was a love letter to those who were willing to fight for their love. The crowd's low exclamations could be heard as the mist shifted, turning into the likenesses of the characters of that myth, all caught up in each other.

A cheer went up as she swayed off the stage, her heart raced, and she could barely hear her friends' congratulations over the sound of her pulse pounding in her ears. As she excused herself, dizzy from the rush of power, she reached out for the one person whose magic she'd longed to feel all night. 

As soon as Neville's magic touched hers, the dam keeping the magic from flooding out from her broke. It went whirling around the entire amphitheatre, bringing dead plants to life, putting colour into people's cheeks, rushing and giggling like a gale. She pulled his magic tightly against herself, wrapping it around her own rippling magical energy. The lehenga she'd been waiting to wear for so long was finally slipped on, and now it was simply a matter of finding him.

Harini's dupatta fluttered behind her as she ran, her eyes bright and her mind caught up in the emotion of the song. The thudding of her feet against the stone floors brought her closer and closer to him with each step, and she was frenzied in her search, clinging to his magic like a guiding star. Her bangles clanged and belled together, and for a moment all she could do was look at him. The chain round her neck had a tiger pendant dangling from it, and it shook softly in the hollow of her throat from the speed of her pulse.The tsunami of magic inside of her screamed to do something, anything. 

She felt her feet walking her to him.


His smile is so gentle.


She felt his magic tangle itself in hers.


He's never going to leave me.


Her hands reached out for him.


He didn't need to ask for my hand in bonding. 


She stood on her tiptoes.


He knew he already had it.


She hooked her arms behind his neck.


I trust him.


She gave him her maiden's kiss."

Thirty-five is old, for a wizard. Older still for an Indian wizard. Beyond inexcusable for an Indian wizard whose siblings' children are all within sniffing distance of double digits. It is not for lack of trying. 

It is certainly not for lack of trying. 

Your wife always looks tired these days and you've told her, in no uncertain terms, that this is the last go around. If this doesn't take, if there isn't a bouncing baby in her arms in nine months' time, you're not indulging this silly notion again. She has wanted this as much as you have, for as long as you have, and you feel like a villain, like a dictator, like you are bleeding her dry for some impossible future, watching all the love in the world you share wash over the floor in sorrow. You are done with watching love die a thousand grisly deaths at the hand of a god that knows no mercy.

You want to be happy. 

You want her to be happy. 

You want to be happy together.

There are plenty of ways to be happy without a child and you and your wife have been lucky enough to discover every one, little sunbursts of treasure hidden in the earth that you unearth, one after another, like little rest stops on the way to the greater pot of gold at the end of the earth. You are the second son (once the third, but not anymore) of a lesser Wizarding family, one that doesn't need more heirs (which correlates quite directly with more enemies, especially with all of you as outspoken as you are) now that your older (once the oldest, now your only) brother has a son.

A beautiful boy, with cheeks like apples and a smirk that could bring God to his knees. His eyes disappear when he smiles, and he smiles often and proudly, daring the world to not share his joy. You fall for him in a thousand new ways every time he comes racing up to your front door with a story to tell. He's got a room in your house, the innumerable drawings he leaves behind plastering the walls like wallpaper, and it looks like the aftermath of a hurricane because you'd never ask him to clean it.

You go look at the mess of his existence sometimes, a fond smile on your face, imagining a little person living in it full time, wading through the papers and crayons and relics of boundless jubilation. 

You imagine a little boy with your wife's eyes, and maybe your nose, and his cousin's knowing smile, racing little plastic cars around the perimeter of the room. You imagine a little girl, braids tied off with ribbons, with a set of watercolor paints she inevitably spills all over the carpet. You imagine yourself comforting her while you erase the evidence with a wave of your wand, imagine yourself holding her gently like the treasure she is. A little girl with plasters on her knees, climbing the fruit tree in your front yard. A little boy with his nose in a book, sitting on the kitchen counter. 

All these ghosts cover every inch of the house, a thousand children that could have been. Somehow you fill the empty spaces they've left behind by giving the love you would have given them (should have given them) to your brother's boy, your only hope, the closest thing you have to a child of your own. The closest thing you might ever have, and he's seven already. In four more years, he'll be away at Hogwarts. Seven years after that, he'll have his own life and you'll be left, bereft, all over again.

You taught him how to bowl a leg spin yesterday, made him watch you do it again and again until he felt confident enough to try himself, and then spent an hour sitting in the grass, watching him practice, determination furrowing his brow, until he could repeat it twice in a row, then thrice. He reminds you of yourself, eternally seconds from shrieking with joy, so thrilled to simply be alive, and you wonder if, someday, you will be lucky enough to teach your own child the things you lavish on your brother's. 

You cycle through the array of ghosts in this room alone, impose the faces and stories you've dreamed up for them on the grape hiding somewhere in your wife's abdomen. Maybe this one is a little boy that likes puzzles, solving all the problems in the world in between chewing up his board books. Maybe this one is a little girl that likes to play Quidditch. Maybe this one is a little boy with more friends than he can count, a little girl with a smile that could rival the sun. 

Maybe this one is the child that survives.

You are thirty-five and you are tired of being sad and by the time this baby comes, you will be thirty-six, which is uncommonly old for a first time parent, among wizards and Muggles alike. 

Maybe you were just never meant to be average. 

Maybe your child will be as special as their circumstances.

You are twenty and you're holding a baby. 

Your baby. 

He has your wife's eyes and pink, shiny gums for miles, and his little nose is just so small. 

You haven't seen too many babies in your life, but if anyone had told you they'd be this small, this fragile, you'd have balked at the idea of having one of your own. Maybe it was for the best, then, that you didn't know, that you assumed he'd come in neat, adult proportions, inflating himself like a balloon the second he was out in the world. You know, logically, that him growing up will take time, that a few years from now, between your personality and your wife's, he'll be talking so much that you'll miss today, miss a time before words and friends and tantrums, but you wish you could talk to your son now and hear him talk back.

You wish you could see understanding in his eyes when you tell him how hard the past two years have been. How you've seen friends and foes alike fall on the battlefield and each death in the Order, whether you knew them well or not, feels like an insult to the earth that nurtured them, the parents that raised them to do the right thing, the world that needed what they had to give. The world that will never get that. 

You have seen people ripped apart and bleeding die on your doorstep, have seen your wife sacrifice sleep at the altar of healing others, have seen far too much for your baby to ever comprehend. You know the feeling of waiting for news far too intimately, have received too many black envelopes from the Ministry, have felt each loss like a hot poker through your chest. 

You are still waiting on your cousin's body, all these years later, some small part of you wishing that he might be alive out there, might be waiting for you.

Here you are, holding this innocent, precious thing, and wishing peace into his heart. Here you are, with gentle hands and a gentler smile, a built in role model for this little boy that is going to see so vividly that the world isn't made to comfort him, to contort itself into a cocoon around him so he has time to become whoever he wants. You will be that cocoon instead. You will stare down death for this boy, who's currently sucking on your pinky finger, and death will lose.

Confidence is never something you've been short on, but maintaining it, especially lately, is a struggle. Remembering, in the depths of war, that you are sacrificing for a good cause is a luxury afforded to few. Money can only do so much. Status can only do so much. Blood can only do so much. You are terrified to bring this brilliant son of yours into such a world, but he's here now. All you can do is keep him here, succeeding where you never had before.

You waited for Neil to come home for three weeks before you gave up. And even now, it hits you like a hammer to the gut -- you gave up on him. You stopped waiting. You stopped sitting in the Owlery at Hogwarts, waiting for a letter that would never come. You haven't allowed yourself to give up on anything since, for better or for worse, and you hope your son will benefit.

It still feels like something is missing, even if you know in your heart that your cousin (your brother) is gone and never coming back, in every moment in your life. And now you miss him like a limb, the ease with which he'd declare all your worries pointless, the ease with which he'd remind you that you are uniquely qualified to love this little boy with everything you've got for as long as you can. You miss a world that never got to be, one where he steals Harry from your grip now, holds him close and tickles his little ears, tells him the same stories he told you. It's weird, mourning something that never happened. Neil is always going to be twenty-three and here you are, somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a half years short of the day your cousin died, with a child in your arms and fear consuming you whole.

You are in desperate need of reassurance, are projecting how much you miss your parents onto every single person you see. Frank tells you it's normal to feel like you're still a child yourself, like you need all the help in the world to this thing that should be natural, but Frank has his parents still. Yours are beyond your reach until this stupid war ends, and even then, they're old. You bear no illusions about how comfortable old age is -- part of growing up with parents carrying age old doubts and worries like yokes around their shoulders, slowly sinking further into the ground with each step. You bear no illusions about how happy theirs will be, with your child to brighten their days, either.

You've been called an incorrigible optimist in varying tones of surprise, dismay, and exasperation and you are proud of it.

""I think you're a miracle, Hari."" You trace the soft slope of his little nose. ""That's something we have in common, I think. My parents always said they knew I was special, the day I was born. I think you're gonna be special too."""

But he had already made up his mind. He was going too fast for Harry Potter on Karrwa Chauth. It's is a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima in the month of Kartika.

They had somewhat of an awkward friendship. Passing each other soft smiles as they walked past each other in Ministry. Looking for each other at ministry balls, even though they don't talk much but still keeping an eye on each other from afar.

It was the perfect opportunity, as Auror Potter, the Head of the Auror Department, and Minister Draco the Head of international relationship, were to invited the ball to Gujarat, India, along with other few members of the department. 

The ball was going to be held at a sanctuary to keep it enclosed from the muggles. Arrangements were made for them to stay there as well. The ball was on the same night as the festival. 

He already decided the best attire with the help of Pansy to wear on the ball night and the stuff he needed to break his fast was already arranged.

That morning Draco woke up before the sunrise to drink a glass of water as he won't get to drink any till night. He made sure to eat something that would last long throughout the day as well, as he had to make arrangements for the other guests arriving for the ball. 

It was no secret that Harry was pansexual. The world went upside down when Harry came out as a part of the LGBT community but the noise died down. 

""Any plans for tonight's ball?"" she nudged his elbow as he stood beside him. ""no, and don't you have a certain redhead to bother?"" he asked he checked the list of guests arriving.

""I do, but a certain brunette almost ate my brain asking me why the hell has Draco not eaten anything since the morning?"" she asked as she leaned in on her elbows and took the
quill from her hand.

Cheeks turned red he involuntarily looked at Harry with Ron who was seated a few tables away from them. He looked away as Draco caught him staring. He smiled and then looked down on his paper again.

""I have some plans,"" he said softly. Hermione sighed to herself as she watched the little scene unfold.

""What plan could possibly require you to starve to death?"" she asked as a matter of fact.

""you're smart Granger, you'll figure it out"" he smiled too sweetly, collected his papers, and left

Three hours later he returned to his room. it was still noon and he was already so hungry. As soon as he was about to close his eyes for a short nap someone knocked on the door. he groaned and got up.

""Weasley"" he regarded Ron.

""Malfoy"" he regarded back. Draco leaned towards the door. they also had an unusual friendship, not much close but he admired Ron. Especially his ability to play wizard chess.

""what do you want?"" he asked 

""we're going to the bazarre. Hermione wants you to join. No excuses."" He said with shrug. He knew denying Ron would only make the queen herself come upstairs to drag him down

""give me 5mins I'll be downstairs"". Ron nodded his head.

""took you long enough,"" said Hermione as she linked her arms with him. They hang out occasionally, and every time they do Hermione gives him a long lecture about how she could practically taste the sexual tension between him and Harry afterward.

""Sorry to keep you waiting your highness,"" he said as they all walked towards the main town. It was hot and if it wasn't for Hermione holding his hand he'd have already fainted.

Draco didn't let his fatigue show on his face but Harry still looked at him worriedly as they walked. Harry was always tongue-tied whenever Draco was around. He'd flush completely whenever they sat a little too close. 

He was such a gentleman to Draco that he had to calm down the urge to just snog the irresistible bastard right there in front of everyone. 

Draco looked back and saw Harry was just walking right behind, apparently checking out his ass. He hooked his fingers in his pants and pulled them a little up in an act to adjust them a bit, or really just highlight his ass more.

Harry tripped over his own foot and he looked up to Draco laughing at him. 

""Careful there, mate,"" said Ron. ""yeah,"" Harry said his cheeks turned red.

""c'mon I want to get mehndi, look how pretty their hands look"" she dragged Draco over to a small stall where a couple of Indian girls were applying Mendi on other women.

They sat on the empty slot. Hermione offered her hand to the man and he started to fill her hand with a beautiful design. The man in front of Draco looked at him warily, apparently not used to a man wanting to apply henna before.

He looked behind Draco and then immediately started working on Draco's hands. Draco looked behind him and saw that Harry was standing over him with arms crossed and a stoic face, the outline of his muscles clearly visible. Draco flashed him a smile and Harry returned it with as much sweetness. 

""I thought this would go along with your plans for tonight,"" said Hermione in his ear. Her smartness never ceases to amaze him. He surged with excitement that he forgot about his empty stomach.

They bought some souvenirs. Harry followed him like a puppy from shop to shop, taking every bag Draco purchased. Draco was enjoying it so much that he might have bought a few extra things that he absolutely didn't need just to make Harry work a little longer. 

When they got back to the hotel, Harry accompanied him to his room to drop the stuff off. 

""are you okay?"" he asked nervously.

""Yeah, why'd you ask?"" Draco answered. Harry caressed his nape in nervousness. Draco loved seeing him like this, the man can get the hardest criminal masterminds to open their mouth but in front of Draco, he was a nervous wreck.

""you didn't eat anything at the breakfast, and not even when we were out?"" he asked.

With a sudden wave of confidence, he said, ""oh, I'm fasting for you?"" he kept his tone nonchalant. Harry who mostly avoided looking Draco in the eyes, abruptly looked at him and stared before he could get his brain to function again.

""Wh... what? Why?"" Harry Potter stuttering, what would the Ministry say if they saw their precious savior like this. Draco smiled at that thought.

""yeah, I thought I'd do the wizarding world a favor by giving their golden boy a couple of extra years to live,"" he said as he watched Harry turn even redder if that was possible.

""meet me at the balcony after the ball Harry"" he stood on his tippy toes and leaned in to plant a soft kiss on Potter's cheek, carefully to keep his hands at a distance, and then walked into his room. 

Draco arrived at the ball at 7 pm, and as always he looked For Potter. When his eyes met him, Harry was already looking at him with wide eyes, Draco wore a red net Sari wrapped around his lithe figure so perfectly it looked breath-taking, and Harry did stop breathing until Ron kicked him in the foot lightly. The cut-sleeve deep neck blouse displayed his collarbones.

He walked towards Draco and offered him his hand. He noticed the Arabic mehndi on Draco's hand was so dark it was almost black. The fancy red bangles he wore made his hands looked so beautiful he never wanted to let them go. He kissed the knuckles and then tangled their hands together.

Harry was also wearing traditional Indian attire. A maroon red Kurta to match with black tight pajama and a scarf. His hair was a mess as always. His aura demanded respect in every room he walked not because he defeated Voldemort but because of who he is, which was just the perfect contrast as he walked towards Draco with a smile so bright it could outshine the sun itself.

Draco noticed that everyone was looking at him and he got a little self-conscious. Harry leaned in his ear and said, ""you look so beautiful Draco"". Draco flushed so hard at the compliment and the way his name on Harry's tongue that it made him forget his worries about any prying eyes.

Since gender-fluidity and equality were the hot topics in politics right now most of the guests encouraged him for showing the courage to break gender norms, some of them judged him but didn't dare say anything with Harry by his side. He didn't leave his side even for a second. Glared at anyone who got a little too close to Draco. He was absolutely enjoying the attention.  

 Draco saw Blaise walking towards, he was there to represent the American community in the wizarding world. Everybody knew that Draco was promised to Zabini by his father, but that world changed when Draco broke off the engagement when his father went to prison and proceeded to price everyone wrong who thought Draco will never be able to handle a position of power, including his father. 

 ""Potter"" they shook each other's hand with a tight grip. He took Draco's hand but instead of shaking he turned his hand and kissed his knuckles. ""you look lovely tonight Draco"" he said with a sharp smirk. Draco took his hand back with a tight smile ""thank you"" 

Harry felt Draco stiffen from Blais's gesture. he wrapped a possessive arm around Draco's waist and pulled him close. He rubbed soothing circles from his thumb on the naked skin which made Draco relax completely into him.

""I was hoping you we can discuss the American-British donation treaties after the party.,"" he asked taking a sip of his champagne. 

""it isn't much of a debate Blaise. Both the ministry decided that the fund will be going to the schools, instead of Zabini funds."" Draco replied with practiced ease.

""it's my money. I can take you to court for that"" Zabini's jaw tightened.

 Harry snorted at his statement, "" cmon Zabini we both know he'd smoke you in the court"". Zabini walked away. 

He also noticed that Harry wasn't eating anything either, ""why aren't you eating?"" he asked when they were finally done shaking everybody's hand.

""Didn't feel right that you weren't eating anything,"" he said casually as he shrugged his shoulders. Draco smiled so brightly that it almost hurt his cheeks.

He saw the moon was out in all its glory. He took Harry's hand and they both slipped away from the part. He brought them to the balcony where Draco conjured the things, he needed to break the fast.

""you know married people do this right"" Harry pointed it out. 

Suddenly embarrassed out of his wits, ""I... know that but it's not mandatory We don't have to-""

Harry cut him off, ""It's okay, I'll change that in a few years,"" he said with a cocky smile. Draco rolled his eyes but, but he smiled with relief.

Draco knew Harry was close with his family in India after the war so he knew how the custom goes. Draco read about it and he wanted to do it as it is. 

He picked up the sieve from the thali, looked to the moon through it, and then faced it towards Harry to secure its blessings.

""quit smiling you goof,"" he said because seriously his own cheeks were hurting pretty bad.

""I can't you look so beautiful like this,"" Harry replied. He circled the thali in front of Harry's face the agarbatti was already lit, its rosy scent only added to their environment. He prayed to every deity who would listen to him to wish all the happiness in the world to Harry along with a long and prosperous life.

Harry took the water from the thali and fed it to Draco. He stopped after drinking half and offered the rest to Harry.

Harry vanishes the content now that their fast is broken and kissed Draco passionately. He wrapped his hand around his slim waist and Draco moved his hands around Harry's neck.

Harry tugged Draco more strongly against him that it pushed the air out of Draco's lung in a gasp. He used the opportunity to explore the inside of his mouth with his tongue. He sucked on Draco's tongue which made him moan in his mouth.

Eventually, they break away for air. For a moment there's no sound except their harsh breathing and the clunk of Draco's bangles as he caressed his hair slowly. 

Harry was lost in the beauty before him, Draco's eyes were dark, lips all swollen and pink, and his cheeks were red. 

Draco's stomach made a demand, interrupting the moment and Harry burst out laughing.

""shut up, I hadn't eaten since last night!"" he whined.

""Sorry love, let's go feed you,"" he said as he walked them back to the party.

Harry vowed to himself to spent all his life plus those extra years Draco wished upon him to make him happy."

Summer break is over, and Neville's come to bring her home. It feels nice to think of it that way. The definition of home has changed multiple times over the years. Her chesire grin greets her older brother when she arrives. ""Annaiyya, are we leaving yet?"" Harry smirks at her fondly before chuckling, ""Calm down, your diwana isn't here yet."" She pinks at that, swatting his hand away from trying to pinch her cheeks. She walks away, feeling a flicker of annoyance even as she sends a mild stinging hex his way, and can't bring herself to be satisfied even by his starled yelp. 

Haru has yet to change into western wear, and can't bring herself to yet. This dress is the same glorious colour as Amma's hair, and it feels ever so luxurious and airy when she glides around a room with purpose. Harry on the other hand, has already changed into his robes, and her 'diwana' will be here soon. She debates changing, but decides not to. Potter crimson is a delicious contrast on her skin, and she looks and feels beautiful. 

Harini's slight embarrassment has yet to fade, but she still believes in the delightful phrase of 'showing yourself to your greatest benefit'. Maybe she's wearing it because she's comfortable. Maybe she's wearing it because it's a beautiful dress. Maybe she's wearing it because it's the same dress she wore when Neville helped her plant those roses around the pavillion in her private garden. Subconscious decision aside, it's beyond her.

It's a fluttery feeling to have someone described as your 'diwana'. Harini has had her fair share of admirers, but none that provoke her brother into teasing. She's fanning herself as she roams out onto the property, waving at the old family parrots and doves that have roosted in the banyan trees scattered around the estate. One of them, Krish, circles just above her head, long tail feathers waving behind him in that familiar shade of green. He pecks at her ear, nibbling and squawking out ominously. Harini tries to calm his fussing, until he screeches irritatingly close to her ears, ""Eagle! Eagle! Eat me!"" 

At the mention of eagles, Harini's eyes and head snap upwards with a reaction time the auror department would be scrambling to get their hands on. Sure enough, it's Neville's, and there is no time left to consider the whys and wherefores of dresses and parrots and infuriating older brothers. Gathering herself, she poises herself to greet Neville, only to find that she can't seem to find him. Harry has also rather mysteriously disappeared. The atmosphere seems ominous, and there is no noise for what seems to be miles, besides Harini's rapidly quickening breathing. 

Confused, she leaves the great hall accompanied by silence, roaming off to her garden to sigh in such a stereotypical manner that's almost embarrassing. Irritation is creeping into her again. It's so strange. Why can't it just be decent and uncomplicated? She stretches out her aura, trying to find any familiar magical signature. Faintly she can sense her parents and her brother, but Neville isn't anywhere she can detect.

She hisses slightly as she runs a finger over the tender flesh of her ear, nipped and bitten enough to be red. Why did Krish have to act up just then? Cursed timing aside, she focuses on the fact that she won't be seeing Krish again for another year, and tries to heal it quickly. Her magic begins to rush to the point of injury to heal her, but a voice murmurs behind her, ""Allow me, my lady."" 

Without turning around, she already knows that it's Neville. His fingers, roughened by years of gardening, are gentle when they run over the top of her ear, and without hesitating, they trail down to remove her earrings and replace them with a different pair.

Harini's breath hitches, and she can't bring herself to be upset with that bird and his antics anymore. It gave her a perfect excuse to come out here, and she can barely stop from pinching herself. Her fingers run over them, they're wild roses hammered out of gold, with rubies inlaid as petals, and tourmaline leaves that make a loop that closes in the back.

Her whole mind is occupied with the fact that earrings are a courtship gift, and that the comb she has in now is carved with roses.

Hours later, Krish gets a nice (if unwelcome) surprise, when Harini, who should be scolding him, does the complete opposite, and clutches the indignant bird in a breathtaking hug. Women (particularly the ones of this house), go by contraries, and this is one more problem that poor Krish will be forced to puzzle his wits over forever.

""Only the best for Malfoys. Malfoys deserve the best.""



The first time Harini had ever heard that was as a teatime inside joke, a running gag the family chuckled over a cup of chai. But when she'd been at those parties, she'd been paying attention. The best? She had always had wanted the best in one form or another. The best house, the best dancing, the best quidditch team, the best clothes...it had been said teasingly, possibly a nod to Narcissa Malfoy, who had been quite like Haru. Chasing after the best since day one.


From the day she'd tried to buy a solid gold cauldron (making her parents double over laughing), to the day she chased the snitch, Neville had liked to tease her, that she always seemed to be on the hunt for gold. If the dozens of hair ornaments, saree pins, necklaces, bangles, earrings and bracelets was anything to go by, her godbrother wasn't wrong.


The best of the best.



White peacocks were a rarity back home. They were vivid and blue and green and brown and gold, never pale as frost like Malfoy peacocks. Draco and Lucius had both been equally surprised when Haru sat down comfortably on a bench, only to be surrounded by birds moments later. The bolder of the peahens took it upon themselves to perch on her shoulders. Parasol twirling behind her, her voice full with easy laughter, Draco had walked her to the Abraxan stables. Harry would remark rather dryly years later that he'd had to pry them off of each other, no matter how often she swore up and down that it wasn't true. ""We were both so young!"" she'd cry, exasperated. The year she'd been sponsored was among the best years of her life. She had been given the best of everything. She had seen firsthand what it was like to be a Malfoy. She decided that she liked it.


Cream of the crop.



Cho Chang hadn't stood a chance at seeker tryouts. Years of being on the hunt for gold, competing with her brother; had made Harini a far superior seeker. Draco gave her a bouquet to congratulate her for her making of the team, so she kept Gladiolus and Ivy growing in her room year after year. When Draco cheered her on in a match against her brother, she took every word to heart. When they went to the Abraxan races, she'd clung to his every word about who he thought they should bet on that season. Hogsmeade weekends they'd spent together as well, sneaking Harry out of the castle so she could laugh silently at his begrudging thanks to Draco each time. Chaperoning Harry and Ginny, she'd always asked him to come with them, since she was sure they'd bore her to death. 


When Harini buys herself a new set of custom combs at the Enchanted Rose, she gets a set of gold Abraxans that Draco compliments her on without fail every time she wears them.


Creme de la creme.



Organza is one of the most finicky fabrics to sew. Haru doesn't care. Everyone is getting their gowns custom made at Olympus. Haru doesn't care. She has to dye it pink and dusty gold herself. Haru doesn't care. There are a hundred flimsy layers and the embroidery is impossible. Haru doesn't care. The cape is too tight around her neck and she has to redo it. Haru doesn't care.


What Haru does care about is the fact that she's going to be a Malfoy, and Malfoys only deserve the best. She doesn't trust anyone to do this right but herself. Her mind wanders to the neckline, the lowest she's ever worn. There is a grey diamond pendant on a gold chain nestled in her cleavage and a pair of possessive grey eyes on her by the end of the Yule Ball.

At the ripe old age of 6, Haru had arrived at Malfoy manor, clinging to her older brother while staring at the palatial grounds before her. The Malfoy family's ancestral magic clung to everything her eyes could see, and being a wary child, she refused to step foot through the wards until Harry picked her up to carry her through himself. She let out a quiet gasp, burying her face in Harry's cloak while her eyes darted to the Malfoys, who were getting nearer every minute. 

 

 



 

""So this is little Harini?"" Narcissa called fondly, waving at them while gliding down the gardens. James and Syra went to say hello, but Harini couldn't bring herself to face the pretty lady her mummy was reminiscing with. She had now managed to yank the cloak over her head until it covered her almost completely, her eyes peeking out from underneath the fine silk. She was enveloped in the safety of her brother's magic, and it was reassuring enough for her to tug at his sleeve to be let down.

 

Walking over with all the daintiness of a little lady in the making, Haru curtsied to Narcissa, before tilting her head upwards for those big blue-grey eyes to shimmer at her. Narcissa let out a soft laugh at that, picking her up to see her up close. ""My my, such a lovely young lady for me to foster! Syra, you're too kind, and believe me, she has your eyes."" Haru felt a flush creeping up on her cheeks. She was lovely? Her family told her that often enough, but there was something so exciting about hearing it from someone new.

 

""I have a gift for you pet, tell me if I've made the right choice."" Lucius walked over, carrying a wrapped box with a silvery ribbon tied over it. His eyes sparkled with mirth, following every little excited giggle Haru let out while unwrapping it with all the clumsiness of an excited child. ""Oh, I love it!"" 

 

In Haru's little hands was a parasol, an airy one made of sky-blue silk, trimmed with french lace and dappling her in the warm morning light. She didn't catch the weighty glance her father gave Lucius, she was altogether too excited by her present. ""Did mummy tell you that my favourite book is The Blue Umbrella? Is that why you got it?"" Narcissa smiled, picking her up again to kiss her soft cheeks. ""You're going to be a Malfoy for the year. Which means you'll only be getting the best, ma petite fee. I mulled this over for quite some time, but I was sure you'd like this from the moment I saw it."" 

 

The best? Haru liked being the best, and she certainly liked having the best, if it meant having things like the parasol. ""I like being a Malfoy then. It seems fun."" Syra and James just barely stifled their laughter, though a few errant giggles bubbled out nonetheless. A voice sounded behind her. ""Well of course it's fun, but 'fun' isn't enough to explain what being a Malfoy's like."" 

 

So this was Draco Malfoy. He was her older brother's age, which must mean he was 7 already, probably almost 8. ""I've got a whole year to learn what it's like, so don't-oh what's the word, daddy? Paperise? Paterise?"" James chuckled, getting down to her level to look her in the eyes. ""You mean patronise, don't you kannamma?"" Haru nodded, turning to stare at Draco. ""Exactly that. I'll know everything there is to know about it by the end of the year, just you wait!"" 

 

That night, Haru sat in the pretty bedroom Narcissa had set up for her, and watching the muslin drapes sway in the milky haze of moonlight was enough to distract her for a minute or two, before she shook her head to get back to the task at hand. 

 


Dear diary, 



 



My sponsorship starts today. Lady Malfoy is so nice to me, and Lord Malfoy gave me a beat beautiful umbrella, just like Binya had in the book! I'm very tired, I spent the last our hour chasing peacocks, they're so funny, they're not like our peacocks, they're all white and they have no blue at all. I guess all the blue is in my parasol now. Don't you like my handwriting? My governess, Miss Clearwater, she's been making me write only in cursive. I think I'm starting to be good at it. 



 



Goodnight Diary,



Haru     




""Weren't you just chasing them a month or two ago?"" Draco called, running to catch up to where Haru sat surrounded by peafowl. ""Since when do they get along with you?"" Haru glared at him, but given that she was glaring through a faceful of a peacock's fanned out tail, it would have been a miracle for him to even see her frowning, let alone be intimidated by her. ""They like me just fine, you just don't know that."" she huffed, pulling the young peacock off her lap and onto the cobblestone path benath her feet. She picked up her beloved parasol, and she was dressed to match it today, in a pretty sundress with lacy trim and a fluffy, light petticoat to make it flare out around her. Oh, how Narcissa had squealed upon realising she now had a little girl to dress up. Haru didn't mind at all, Narcissa was good at finding pretty dresses for her, and Haru felt special whenever she was allowed to get a new dress custom made.

 

The parasol served it's purpose well, keeping them both out of the heat while they walked to the stables. ""Draco, you're 8 now."" she said, making him stare at her for a moment before responding that yes, he was in fact 8 years old. ""Well, since you're older than me, can you go on the big Abraxans instead of the ponies?"" Draco shook his head, looking wistfully at the pegasi that utterly towered over him. ""Not yet. Father won't let me."" Haru frowned, pulling him along while they walked ahead. ""Daddy lets Harry go on a broom and all, but he isn't allowed to ride either. Mummy says it's because horses have a mind of their own and you need to build up trust and partnership with them before you ride."" 

 

""Oh whatever,"" Draco groaned, shoving his hands into his pockets in a way that his mother would have boxed his ears for. Haru took his silence as an invitation to continue, and oh did she ever. ""Heiress Macnamara came over the other day. She gushed all about her bonding, apparently she's bonding on Yule this year! It's ever so romantic, isn't it? She's got such a pretty bonding gown selection too, she let me see them! All floaty, she's going to look like a fairy! Are we going to be invited to go, Draco?"" 

 

Perhaps hearing Haru use 'bonding', 'fairy', 'romantic' and refer to herself and the Malfoy family as 'we' was the reason a flush burned across Draco's face. Haru, ever the happy child, thought nothing of it, and simply used her magic to cool her hands, only to watch in horror as his cheeks only got redder. ""Draco! I think you might be having a heatstroke! We should go inside, you don't look very well."" Draco just stared off into space incredulously for a moment or two before agreeing to let her pull him along back into the manor.

 

""Mere! Draco is completely red! I think he's been out in the heat for too long, his face looks like a lobster's."" Narcissa fussed over him for half an hour, as she was wont to do, before shooing them out of the parlor to go play together upstairs. Somewhere between mortified and thoroughly humiliated, Draco collapsed into one of the cushions laying around the aviary. Haru, incorrigible as ever, immediately ran to the birds, talking a mile a minute about some vivid mental gymnastics of princesses and peacocks and silk ribbons on bonding gowns. Draco's embarrassment was obvious in his magic, and Haru picked up on and ran over to him. 

 

""I don't like it when mere fusses either, but it was for your own good!"" Draco, in no mood to explain himself, simply got up and took Haru by the hand. ""Will you sneak off with me? I want to figure out how to ride a broom before your brother does."" Haru's delighted giggle resonated through the high glass room, startling some of the hawks. ""Let's go, let's go, let's go! Oh, I can't wait to see Harry's face when I can do a barrel roll on a broom better than he can."" 

 

One might consider it prophetic that Lucius, despite having overheard this exchange, chose wisely not to interfere, but instead let them be. In any case, the early start may have been what Ravenclaw's quidditch team would owe their fantastic victory to a decade later. Perhaps it was for the best Harry wasn't aware of what gave his sister the advantage, because that knowledge might ensure that Haru's beloved childhood broom wouldn't come out of it unscathed.

 


Dear Diary,



 



I think Draco isn't very well today. He did take me flying tough, and he said to keep it a secret from everybody and that it's just between us 
two
 both. I had fun, and Draco didn't even look queasy anymore after he got on the broom. Maybe he just 
acted 
like he wasn't well to get out of going to the stables with me. No, I don't think he would do that. Oh, mere's calling me to come have dinner. Sorry I can't write much diary, I do so much all day and then my bedtime is so soon after dinner that if I write I can't read a bedtime story anymore. I promise to write more, mummy says I should, because 'sponsoring is the most special part of a child's life and something that should be remembered.'



 



Goodnight Diary,



 



Haru



 


 

 

 



""Oh, do you remember this?"" Haru exclaimed, levitating the memory book closer to where she and Draco were sitting. The book was flipped open to a page-wide picture of Haru getting a kneazle as a present before she left Malfoy manor. Spinel, her much beloved pet, had been only a month and a half old in the picture. Now, older and fluffier, this feline carried himself with all the princley demeanor that came with having a Potter maiden's love. He was 9 pushing 10 now, and had very comfortably wrapped himself about Haru's leg while she sat on the stable roof with Draco in the receding daylight. Draco leaned lower to take a look, and it made Haru's heart race at the direct reminder of how different he was to the child she had grown up with. ""You were squealing so loudly father was afraid we'd have to replace our heirloom stained glass windows."" 

""Is that- Is that a KNEAZLE!"" Haru's high pitched screech rang in Draco's ears, and he had half a mind to call his mother, but his friend's pure happiness and the sheer joy on her face was enough to soften his annoyance. ""Well yes, it's for you."" Haru's baby blues had just looked beseechingly at the kitten before they went wide with  excitement at his announcement.  "" I'm going to name him Spinel! ""  


 


Haru then proceeded to spend the next half hour babying the thing and fussing over it like she was it s mother. Every little kitten sneeze made her gasp, it s mouth opening in a small yawn would make her sigh, and seeing it fumble inelegantly over its own paws only made her giggle fondly. Draco was sure she had bloody well fallen in love with the damned thing, and he wouldn't know until years later just how right he was.

Haru turned to glare at Draco, her face halfway buried in Spinel's silky grey fur. Pulling her kneazle away from the hug, she tugged him to her chest and huffed indignantly. ""I reacted like any reasonable young lady would, so don't you go implying anything else."" Draco threw his head back to laugh, and Haru swore she could feel the intensity of the sound resonating in her own bones from her place tucked comfortably next to him. ""Yes, you reacted like any reasonable young lady. A reasonable young lady, mind you, who would someday become a spinto soprano in Flitwick's choir."" At that, even Haru had to laugh, remembering fondly her head of house's surprise when she turned up to try out for his choir within a week of being sorted into Ravenclaw, before belting a note in 'Memory' for a solid ten seconds. 

 

""I like to think I'm talented."" She teased, before flushing and feeling glad it wouldn't show on her skin when Draco looked at her with such softness. ""I absolutely agree with you, only, will the lady entertain my request to demonstrate one of these many talents?"" Haru giggled, pulling Spinel into her arms before running down the edge of the roof to the staircase on the sides. ""Come on already, I've been practicing a new dressage routine for weeks!"" She called, racing off to go find Lunala and get her saddle onto her before Draco could catch up to her. "

Draco holds the limp, lifeless body in his pale arms. Pale, except for the Dark Mark permanently fused into his forearm. 



The Boy Who Lived.



Now, The Boy Who Died.



The battlefield is clear now, except for Draco pointlessly holding Harry Potter in the middle of a decimated Hogwarts.



Tears stream down Draco's cheeks unchecked and unnoticed. The last few months of working as a spy for the Order, pointless. Draco's secret relationship with Harry, gone. The future they had planned together after the war, vanished.



Nothing matters anymore. Not his father's expectations or his mother's promises of a better life or Draco's now destroyed dreams. 



Draco's whole world is lying stiff in his arms. There will be no more midnight kisses, no more racing heartbeats, no more stifled laughter under the sheets, no more brightness in Draco's cold life.



Cold.



Everything is cold now. 



Maybe it always has been.



Draco reaches and grab's Harry's forgotten wand, Draco's long-lost somewhere in the battle.



Fresh tears fall from Draco's eyes. ""I'm so sorry, Harry. I failed you. I should have here. I should have protected you and fought by your side. I could have saved you. I could have 

protected

 you dammit!"" 



He sobs softly, caving in on himself. ""I can't do this, Harry. I can't go back to the Death Eaters and pretend like we didn't happen."" 



Draco brings Harry's wand to his own temple. ""I won't do it. I won't be alone again.""



A deep breath.



""Obliviate.""


 


--



""Draco!""



Draco's eyes snap open to Harry shaking his arm, a look of concern plastered on his face. It's still dark outside. Definitely not waking hours.



""I'm up, I'm up."" His body is sticky with sweat from the nightmare. Draco groans as he sits up, rubbing his face wearily. He catches a glimpse of the Dark Mark on his arm and closes his eyes against it. 



""Sorry that I woke you up,"" Draco leans over and plants a small kiss on Harry's still-creased forehead. ""Go back to sleep, babe.""



Harry's darker-skinned hand raises up to cup Draco's cheek. ""You were screaming... You screamed my name.""



Draco merely nods.



Harry frowns even more. ""The war?""



""The war.""



Harry brings Draco into a hug. They both have nightmares. There are things that will never leave them. ""If you ever want to talk about it, I'm here. I'm right here.""



Draco nods, real tears slowly filling his eyes. After a minute, he managed to choke out, ""You were dead. You were dead in my arms because I didn't fight beside you and I didn't block that curse from Bellatrix.""



His chest was caving in, his lungs collapsing. He gasps for breath, but finds none.



""Hey, hey,"" Harry says softly, letting his partner go immediately. Instead, he takes Draco's hands in his, knowing that any more touch than this during one of Draco's panic attacks will only make things worse, unless specifically asked. ""Look at me. Draco, baby, look at me. I'm here. I'm right here. Take a breath with me, okay?""



Draco takes a few shaky breaths, but barely calms down. ""It was so real. You were dead and gone and I was alone and y-y-you...""



Harry nods, kissing Draco's hands softly. ""It wasn't real. I'm here with you. I'm not going anywhere. It wasn't real.""



Draco looks straight into Harry's eyes for the first time tonight and nods slowly. He starts to slowly get his breathing under control. 



""Come here,"" Draco whispers, pulling Harry in close for another embrace. 



""I love you, Potter.""



""Potter?"" Harry chuckles, exactly the reaction Draco was hoping for. ""Are we back on that again?""



""Besides the point. I love you.""



""I love you too, my Draco.""

Neville leaned over the balcony, looking down to see the commotion outside. There was altogether too much excited yelling outside. Today was Raksha Bandhan. Harini had invited him over, smiling and sunshiny. Uncle Sirius and Aunt Janaki were having a real time of it trying to round to boys up, so that Haru could give them their Rakhis. To start off the day spectacularly, Harry had been dangling upside down on his broom, before righting himself and remarking rather cryptically that his little sister had a surprise that he wasn't sure he liked. Before Neville had even had the time to decipher what that statement was supposed to mean, he had zoomed off, calling to see where Haru was. He hadn't even seen her yet. Uncle Sirius had been dragging Aries and Leo downstairs, while Aunt Janaki had given him a tray of Kaju Katlis and sent him off to the balcony.





 

In all the chaos of the occasion, Deepika had managed to get away from her grandmother, who was trying in vain to get her dressed for the occasion. She'd run off to go find-""Akka!"" , she yelled, her voice carrying all the way to Neville. He could hear a faint clinking of bells-Haru's anklets-and some hushed giggling, before he heard Haru's voice. ""Kannamma, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with Ammamma? You aren't ready yet."" Neville heard the pout in Deepu's tone. ""I wanted you to dress me! You always pick the nicest dresses Akka. You look so pretty today too! You should wear green and red more, it suits you!"" He stopped really listening after that. Red...and green? Had he heard her correctly? Lost in his thoughts, he didn't realise that they'd left, until of course, he hear Haru's unmistakable shrieking. ""Anna! You idiot! Get down from there or I won't let Amma give you any of the sweets I made."" A peal of laughter-Harry's, he realised- rang out, and then Deepu let out an indignant squeal. She did hate getting picked up without warning. 

 

A faint knock sounded on the door behind him, and he heard Padma Patil's voice from the other side. ""Neville? You there? Atthamma said I'd be able to find you here."" Shaking his head in an attempt to clear his thoughts, he went to open the door. Padma cheerfully handed him a deep red envelope, a jalebi, and tied a Rakhi around his wrist. ""Happy Raksha Bandhan!"" she smiled, before tilting her head in the direction of the noise. ""Harry and Parvati are waiting for me,"" she said, ""I really should get going. But I did want to give you the Rakhi Akka and I made for you before the party started."" Waving, she ran off to the gardens and the quidditch pitch, where everyone else was gathered. Neville ran a hand through his hair in frustration. Aunt Janaki had asked to stay here, Deepu had mentioned something about her sister in green, and the Patil twins had given him their Rakhi and left for the partying. Where was Haru? It was unlike her to forget. Wasn't she going to give him some kind of surprise?  What was going on?

 

His eyes trailed over the latticework Aunt Janaki had done over the rooftop gardens. It was all carved flowers and gemstones. His mind wandered to the flowers Haru had worn over the years. Jasmine, the smell of it so strong that it was burned into his memory. It had hung tantalisingly from her hair, looped up in swooping vines and braids. Hibiscus, as wide as his outstretched palm, tucked behind her ears carelessly, no matter the colour. Pink, yellow, red, orange, like a burst of sunset haze, or deep blue and white and violet, like a twilight sky. Bougainvillea, stalks of it wrapped around her skirts as foliage whenever she decided to attend the ministry gala in western robes. Honeysuckle and Wisteria, the same flowers that he'd seen growing out of the window box in Haru's weaving room for years now. Roses, so vivid that-""Neville?"" The minute he turned to face her, his eyes widened.

 


She was dressed in his colours. She was wearing House Longbottom's Evergreen. She was in Longbottom green, and she hadn't given him a Rakhi.


 

The flush barely showed on her face, but her ears pinked at his expression. Neville on the other hand, was far too preoccupied with staring at her. The brilliance of the green was all the more visible in silk, and he could practically feel her magic radiating off of it. 

 


She'd woven it herself.


 

The skirt flared out around her, starting at her hips and flowing outward elegantly, trailing slightly on the ground. The outward edge shimmered in gold, and he realised that like Aunt Janaki, the gold on her dress was real gold. Gold that was hammered into thread. Her blouse matched the skirt, with Potter crimson sleeves that stopped at her elbows, and while the neckline wasn't deep, it was wide, and her collarbones were magnificent, even in shadowy, spotty light under the Morning Glory trellises. The crimson saree piece draped around her still exposed most of her stomach on one side, and the bangles, the necklace, her armbands, the waist band, her earrings, they were all green and gold. 

 

But the one detail that kept him staring was her hair. Dark, thick, and wavy, it tumbled down her back before it stopped just above her knees. The pin she'd been given on her coming of age ceremony years ago was tucking the hair back on one side, while gold peacock feathers and roses were braided through the rest. While the sheer amazement of seeing it open and left down was encompassing most of his thinking mind right now, a small voice in the back of his mind was yelling distantly, telling him that something was off. Hadn't Deepu been bragging to his mother that her sister's hair was long enough to touch the ground? Why had it suddenly gotten shorter?

 

He barely processed the sound of her anklets as she walked closer, his mouth was still dry. ""Ha-Haru?"" His voice was a faint whisper, he barely heard it himself over the sound of his own heartbeat. His eyes raked over her hands, detailed painstakingly and beautifully with scenes of gardens and palaces and kings and princes and queens. Spread out over the backs of her hands were peacocks flirting their tails at the viewer, and trailing down her arms were dancing princesses and lotuses and swordfights. The sheen of her magic, a soft shade somewhere between cream and off white was shimmering over her fingertips, and before he really understood what was happening, she was right in front of him, looking fearlessly up at him. Wordlessly, she summoned the hair she'd cut into her upturned palms, and Neville couldn't do anything but stare. Stare at the apparition who appeared before him, offerring everything he'd ever wanted for him to have with Harini. 

 

""I-I haven't wanted to give you a Rahki in four years; Nev,"" she said softly, her hands shaky. ""I haven't-I haven't invited you over for Raksha Bandhan for all this time, because I can't convince myself to just let you be a-a brother to me. I want something different, something more than just that. I want you and I to have the kind of love I'm a witness to everyday. The way dad calls Amma Jaanu, the way they laugh and have that-that companionship, they have each other and they're happy, and-"" she stopped, her arms still quivering from the weight of the confession. She seemed to steel herself before offerring him the braided hair that had been woven into a soft, clothlike piece, decorated with gold, flower-shaped pins. ""I don't ever want to give you a Rakhi. I want to give you my, hand, my love, my soul, and if you'll have me-""

 

He kissed her. A hand cupping her cheek, another to steady her.

 

When they pulled away from each other, Haru's relieved chesire grin looked back at him. ""I reckon this is the sort of surprise Harry didn't want me to recieve?"", he chuckled softly, tilting her chin up to look him in the eye. Haru giggled at shook her head, the motion making her hair swish behind her. ""He said that he wasn't sure if he liked it. I think the plan wasn't stupid enough for it to be any fun for him. Not enough stupid risks. Still, he's your godbrother, and he thinks you're the best choice I could've made out of all of them."" She put one of her hands on top of the hand he held her cheek with, breathing in deep. 

 

""Would you like to hear a secret? I asked Amma to have this garden. I asked her if it could be mine. I wanted something that would keep me thinking of you, no matter how far away you felt."" 

 

""Would you like to hear a secret? I've wanted you to be mine for years. I asked myself if you'd be mine. I wanted something splendid that would make you realise I was in love with you.""

 

A pretty picture to add to a garden full of them, Heir and Heiress walked out arm in arm, Rakhis and brothers alike all but forgotten in the little tableau of human love and happiness they made. At any rate, neither was much missed, since the younger a sister is, the easier to get a rise out of her, and everyone was thoroughly entertained by good company, good food and festing, by antics and mischief and excitement, and almost nobody noticed a lovely young thing in green running up and down the stairs.

She's laughing into Harry's shoulder at something she can't manage to say between her constant giggles and the muffling of wool. Harry himself is all sweet affection where he's draped over Cho, beaming smile squished where his cheek presses against her dark hair. It'd be a nice sight, seeing them so happy and relaxed, if the Leaky Cauldron wasn't closed and Hannah wasn't glaring daggers at him.


            He adores Hannah, she's very sweet, but even she doesn't want to try and move his two soulmates when they're like this. Harry and Cho don't get rowdy when intoxicated. But they do get awfully clingy, and intoxicated they are. Cedric doesn't know how or why considering neither of them usually drink very much and both are lightweights but Hannah had contacted him via floo and demanded that he come pick them up.


            Harry spots him first and Cedric knows because his eyes light up and he does this sort of excited and pleased wiggle, like he can't contain himself. Harry can get pretty nonverbal without warning but he's always liked when Cho talks and doesn't like to interrupt.


            Cedric crouches in front of them, the scuffing sound of his shoes perking up Cho, and lets Harry cup his cheek in his right hand. Warm and dry with a smattering of callous, he leans into the familiar gesture. Harry nearly coos with delight at the reciprocation, even after all these years, which sends both a bubble of warmth through him and prods awake something vicious and mean.

           
He hates the Dursleys. He hates the people who would take a baby and hurt him as he grows until the boy they produced was convinced that he didn't deserve to be loved and that a hand on a face was always going to be a slap. He hates the people who are still the reason for cold sweat nightmares after war and rebuilding and struggle. He hates Harry's personal monsters in the closet. Merlin, he still hates Dudley a good bit despite his 3 years of efforts to make amends and the consistent therapy the two were doing now.


            And the worst thing? The worst thing is that Harry forgives them. The worst thing is that Harry forgave them so quickly even though it wasn't good for him. Sometimes, Cedric wonders how he's the Hufflepuff.


            Cedric doesn't know why his soulmates are sitting on the floor but he takes the opportunity to just look for now. It's nice with Harry's thumb gently stroking his cheek and Cho's hands playing with the lapels of his peacoat. He lets her reel him in with little tugs until his lips meet hers, soft and sweet. He can feel Harry's fingers tangle in his hair and heat of breath and scratch of beard against his neck. They fit together, not in a way that came naturally but from long habit. "" 'm sleepy,"" someone murmurs. There's giggles all around, muted and flagging.


            Cedric hauls Harry up first because he knows that Cho will find her feet by way of the solid grip Harry has curled around her waist. Harry will never be good at letting go.


            It's a little bit of maneuvering to wiggle his way under Harry's lanky weight and they're not at all balanced with Cho's toes barely touching the floor. Hell, Harry's toes are barely touching the floor though it's not for lack of trying on his soulmate's part. He's pretty sure that Harry's trying to climb him, if not like a tree then like a bed. If there was ever a moment Cedric wished he was taller or stronger, this would be it; buried under the deadweight of two people he has to move.


            A laugh startles him. He looks up from under what feels like Harry's entire upper torso to see Hannah with her head down on the bar, shaking with helpless giggles. She props her head on one hand with an amused grin stretched into her palm. ""How far do you think you can carry them?""


            He tries to scowl at her from around Cho who's gotten loose of Harry's grip and is half hanging from his neck and playing with his cheek, trying to pull his lips into a smile. ""Home, hopefuwaugh,"" as Cho hooks her thumb under the corner of his mouth.


            ""Cedric, you need to smile more,"" Cho tells him very seriously. ""You're too frowny."" He looks at her with her overly serious and flushed face. Harry's stubble is rubbing against his forehead, probably nodding in agreement. Cedric grasps her by the wrist and extracts her fingers from his mouth. He mock growls at her before pressing a kiss to the back of her knuckles.


            ""Need some help?"" Hannah asks as she weaves through the tables. Gently, she snags Cho's sleeve and thank the stars because Cho immediately latches onto her. Harry, though, makes this sad, little, hurt sound. Cedric feels his heart skip, thinking Harry's gone and hurt himself. That is until Harry nearly topples both of them by reaching for the two women.


            ""Can't I just stun them?"" Cedric hauls Harry into something resembling a fireman's carry. ""Real quicklike and then I could levitate their unconscious bodies home, to bed even."" Hannah laughs, not because she's cruel but because she knows he'll never do it. Waking up stunned and hungover isn't something he'd curse anyone with.
""Go home Cedric,"" Hannah says. ""I'll feed your Cho up with something to absorb the alcohol. Make sure that one."" She points a finger at Harry's (in Cedric and Cho's opinion) nicely shaped posterior. ""Has some water before he crashes."""

1972


It was the last day before the Christmas holidays and different to that time the previous year, young Sirius Black was happy about that, because this year he didn't need to go home. He was going to stay at James' place and it was going to be bloody amazing!

As soon as he and his friends had boarded the Hogwarts Express and were seated in a compartment they started plotting potential pranks. They had sweets from the trolley witch and arrived in London in no time. 

In the corner of his eye Sirius saw the stern look of his mother, but the next second he found himself engulfed in a big warm hug like he'd only ever gotten one from Mrs. Potter. They flooed straight from platform 9  3/4  to Godric's Hollow. 

As he stepped out of the fireplace, the first thing his eyes fell on was a rather small but colourfully decorated Christmas tree and a wave of pine sent hit his nostrils. Sirius sighed. This was already miles better than every Christmas he'd ever had at Grimmauld place. Everything in the Potter's house was cozy and welcoming. He had been there before shortly, but at this time of year it was even better. You could feel the Christmas spirit in the air. As Sirius stood there dumbstruck, James wasn't that enthusiastic. ""Come on, Sirius"" he pestered, ""Let's go to my room"". 

The young Black pulled himself together and followed his friend upstairs while Mr. Potter levitated their trunks towards James' room where a guest bed had already been set up. Even though they had a perfectly functional guest bedroom, the Potters figured that the two best friends would want to spend as much time together as possible. And they were correct. 

They hadn't even set everything up yet when Mrs. Potter called them for dinner. At home, he and Reg normally ate separately in the kitchen and the food that the house elves made was tasty, but you could definitely taste all the love Mrs. Potter had cooked into the food. It was more than just nutrition. 

It was already late when the boys went upstairs that night after a lovely board game night, but they talked for another two hours after. James' breaths got deeper and deeper and after a while Sirius heard the silent snores he was so used to. His friend had fallen asleep but the boy lay awake for a few more minutes processing all the new impressions of the day. Then sleep came over him as well with a smile on his face. 

Even though he had gone to sleep later Sirius awoke before the young Potter. Like it always is at a friend's place, he didn't dare to wake him up, so he waited, his gaze going through the room. All the walls were cluttered with Quidditch posters and James even had a framed trikot signed by his favourite player. There were also shelves filled with some books, trophies from James' childhood Quidditch team and clutter. Like the rest of the house it felt like home. Sirius' room at home was actually inspired by this one. 

""Mornin',"" mumbled a sleepy James as he yawned and stretched.""Good morning mate,"" Sirius greeted him in return. After they had gotten dressed they made their way downstairs. In the hallway they already smelled bacon and eggs and it was only then that they realized how hungry they were. They set the table and waited impatiently for Mr. Potter to finish cooking. ""Did you sleep well Sirius?"" he asked as he scrambled some more eggs ""Yes, thank you,"" the boy replied politely. 

Nothing spectacular happened that day, but it was great nonetheless. The boys went outside to play Quidditch in the backyard that was enchanted so that muggle neighbors couldn't see anything suspicious and overall had a lot of fun. It was Christmas Eve, and the Potters, who were actually quite fond of muggle things and technology, and their guest spent the evening in front of the TV. Sirius had never seen something like that before. He'd never thought that something like that would be possible without magic. That night, it was even harder for the boys to go to sleep. The excitement was too big even though none of them believed in Father Christmas anymore.

"" Hey!  "" Sirius heard a whisper. Still mostly asleep he grunted and turned around, facing away from the disturbance. ""  Come on, man  "", then Sirius was poked in the side. He didn't react. The next thing he knew were fingers all over him. James had decided that a tickle attack would be the only way to get the attention he wanted. ""Stop!"" Sirius squealed, attempting to roll off the bed to escape. He grabbed his pillow and hit his bed friend with it. Soon it had turned into a full on pillow fight. 

When they took a moment to breathe James remembered why he had originally wanted to wake up his friend. It was Christmas day! Said friend had come to the same conclusion almost simultaneously. ""It's Christmas!"" they screamed in unison and proceeded to run down the stairs.

Hearing the commotion the boys running down the stairs created Mr. and Mrs. Potter came out of their bedroom, smiles on their faces. They were happy that their son had something like the sibling he had always wished for. 

They spent Christmas day with James' extended family. The house was full of cousins, aunts, uncles and other relatives. They had food Sirius had never encountered before. Things like samosas, chicken tikka, batata vada, bhajias, chutneys and so on, most of which had been brought by the family, were shared around. Sirius was seated with James and all of his cousins. Later when they had finished eating and started to get bored they played games. 

Together with three of James' cousins, they sneaked outside into the garden, starting an epic snowball fight. The adults seemed to ignore the underage magic they used to create the quickest and most unerring balls. Frozen to the bone but happy they got back inside just in time for dinner.

Overall Sirius had a lot of fun and by the sounds of it the adults did as well. The whole atmosphere was cheerful and easy, so different from everything he was used to and Sirius loved it. 

Most of the people stayed the night, so as James' room was occupied all the kids slept on the living room floor on a lot of blankets and pillows. 

Boxing day and basically the rest of the holiday they spent playing with their presents and Quidditch. As early January came around, they were reunited with their school friends on platform 9  3/4 . 

 


1980


A few years later Sirius still vividly remembers that particular holiday season.

Over the years he had had so many lovely winter holidays with his friends. 

In their 4th year James, Peter, Remus and he had spent Christmas at Hogwarts because the full moon fell into the break. 

After that they had started the tradition of throwing infamous New Years Eve parties at James' place with all their friends on one of which he had shared his first kiss with the love of his life and one of his best friends. 

When James and Lily (finally) got together, their friend groups merged and Marlene taught them how Hanukkah was celebrated. 

It was safe to say that the winter holiday season quickly became Sirius' favourite time of the year. 

This year however, the situation was different. The war had become more and more dangerous and a big party was not a thing anybody in their right mind would do at that point.

And another thing was very different from the previous years: there was a sleeping baby on his chest as he lay on the sofa, his head on Remus' lap. Harry, his godson and if you asked Sirius, the 5 month old was the sweetest and greatest child that has ever been.

So he lay there, as a tipsy James and Peter got into an argument over the game of wizards chess they were playing and his boyfriend talked to the mother of the baby, Lily, who was sitting in an armchair across from him, reminiscing about the past year and his life. 

In silence he thanked the Sorting Hat for putting him into Gryffindor.

She had crept out of her bed and room and headed down to the living room, where she saw her amma curled up on the rocking chair, nursing a cup of tea while staring fondly at Al's appa, who was sprawled across the couch, making jokes. ""Amma, appa,"" Al whispered. They both looked up to see her staring at them, her eyes wide and teary.


A concerned expression crossed her amma's face. ""Come here, baby,"" she said, setting her tea down on the small side-table next to her and patting her lap.



Al ran across the room to spring into her mother's lap and wrap her tiny arms around the woman. ""What's up, Al?"" Al's appa asked, turning to face them.



""Can I tell you something?""



""Of course, baby boy,"" Amma said. Al cringed in her lap.



""I don't think I'm a boy,"" she whispered. Her amma and appa's eyes widened as they stared at their daughter.



""Well then, what do you feel like?"" Appa asked, sitting up and turning to her. The two identical pairs of green eyes stared at each other solemnly.



Al tore her gaze away and instead looked down at her tiny hands. ""I'm a girl,"" she said.



Her amma's grip on her tightened and her appa moved again, this time so he was kneeling in front of them. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Do you still want to be Albus Severus?""



Al shook her head. ""No,"" she said. ""It's a boy's name."" Her appa nodded and kissed her on the forehead.



""Okay. How about you go to bed and your mom and I will discuss your new name?"" Al nodded at him. Her amma seemed reluctant to let go of Al even as her appa picked her up.



""I love you, baby b-girl,"" she said, her words soft.



""I love you too, amma,"" Al said, with a bright, tired smile. 



...



After Al had been put back to bed, Harry and Ginny were sitting back in the living room. Ginny was on Harry's lap and he had his arms wrapped around her, his chin resting on her shoulder.



""We need to talk to Mione and Lu,"" he finally said. Ginny nodded and bit her lip.



""Yeah,"" she said. ""We do. Oh, and I'm choosing Al's name this time."" Harry pouted but didn't disagree.



""So what do you think about all this, Gin?""



""I think we need to be supportive. I'm happy Al feels comfortable telling us this and we're going to make sure we're worth that,"" Ginny said.



""You're right. We'll get Hermione, Ron, Rosie, and Hugo here tomorrow and talk to Lu tonight. I want them to bring Lysandra and Lorcan with to talk to Al. Hermione can show us how to do name changes and help us find everything we need to help Al. Maybe we can talk to some people in the trans community to? Go to one of the meetings with Mione?"" Ginny chuckled and relaxed in his arms.



""You're so 

prepared

,"" she teased. ""What happened to the reckless, impulsive boy I fell in love with?"" 



Harry grinned down at her and pecked the crook of her neck and shoulder. ""He grew up and got a family."" 



Ginny turned her head to beam brightly at him before asking, ""What do you think about Alice Minerva for Al's new name?""



""I like it. Nev and Minerva may cry when we tell them, though,"" Harry said. Ginny giggled and relaxed against his warm, solid chest. 



""And it can still shorten down Al if our baby decides he--she wants a more gender-neutral name.""



""Perfect. We'll talk to Jamie and Lil in the morning?""



She twisted to attempt to nuzzle at his his golden-brown neck. ""In the morning."" She paused for a second. ""Har?""



""Yeah, love?""



She looked up at him and could see every amber and copper fleck in her chocolate-brown eyes. ""We're good for them, right? Even though you and I aren't in love the way people think parents should be? Even though I'm ace and don't really think about sex except for our kids?"" Harry tightened his grip on her and kissed her on the nose.



""Calm down, love. We're great parents--our kids love us, Al-Alice felt comfortable coming out even if...she's still young and somewhat naive. We are good parents.""



Tears welled up in her eyes. ""Thanks Harry.""



""No problem, Gin.""

""To Mrs. Dursley,



It is my deepest regrets to inform you of the tragedy that occurred the night before last. Your sister Lily and her family were attacked in their home. As you might have heard from her, our people have been engaged in a war of sorts with a man named Lord Voldemort, or more commonly known as 'You-Know-Who', and his supporters. Lily and her husband James were a part of this resistance, and their involvement made them a target. At this time we do not know how Lord Voldemort found Lily, as she and her family were under our most secure protection. Yesterday, one of our supporters went to visit Lily only to find the house destroyed and your sister and her husband murdered. We believe their son, Hari, was also a target but for some unknown reason, he survived the curse that killed his parents. As you can see, a wound was caused by the ineffectiveness of the curse, which will no doubt leave a scar. Somehow, Hari's survival meant the downfall for Lord Voldemort. He is a hero in our world. It is for this reason that we ask you and your family to take in Hari, and raise him away from the spotlight.



I know this is an incredible amount of information to receive in a letter. Should you have any questions, do not hesitate to send an owl to myself or to Professor Dumblefore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.



Regards,Minerva McGonagallHogwarts HeadmistressProfessor of Transfiguration""


The letter was written in green cursive on sturdy parchment, and had been found on the front step of Petunia Dursley's house. Or rather, the letter was on top of a bundled baby that had been lying on the stoop. Such an occurrence had been quite the shock to Mrs. Dursley, who had only sought to grab the early November's morning paper. Instead, she had received both the paper and another child.

She lived with her own husband Vernon and their child, a boy named Dudley not much older than Hari. Petunia and her sister Lily were very much estranged, due to the fact that Lily was a witch and Petunia vowed to hate everything that involved magic. See, she was a Muggle and therefore resented Lily for having the magical skills she herself did not possess. The jealous, spiteful voice in the back of her head privately thought it fitting that Lily's beloved magic was her downfall. 

Still, the part of her that felt for her sister wept at the thought of her mangled body being found by a visitor next to her crying baby. Petunia wiped away a stray tear, and picked up her nephew whom she had laid on the sofa before reading the letter to examine him more closely. He was still asleep in his blankets, and from what Petunia could see, he looked absolutely nothing like his mother. Where Lily was red haired and freckled, Hari had black hair and dark brown skin. Petunia had never met James, but had seen a picture (a moving picture) of him on the wedding invitation Lily had sent. The Dursleys has agreed right away to decline the invitation. Not only was the wedding to be magical, but also interracial. Now, Petunia held the offspring of that marriage cut short. In addition to his features that seemed unseemly to Petunia, almost the entire left half of Hari's face was covered by a fresh cut that started at his hairline and branched out like a bolt of lightning. Petunia couldn't help but think what a pathetic looking child he would become.

Hari must have felt his aunt's scrutinizing gaze, for soon enough he gave a small yawn and opened his eyes to return her stare. Petunia gasped and nearly dropped the boy when he did this, for his eyes were nothing short of unnatural.

His right eye was brilliantly green in color, just as his mother's had been. This resemblance might have been enough to touch the last of Petunia's humanity had his left eye been the same. Instead of green, this eye was almost completely white. The pupil and iris were fogged over from where his scar continued across the eyeball's surface. The boy began to wail in confusion as both eyes flit around the Dursleys' living room, but only saw about half of it. 

Petunia tried to hush him so as to not wake her husband and child, but to no luck. She heard Vernon's heavy footsteps as he got out of their bed and started down the stairs.

""What in God's name is all that racket?"" he whispered loudly from the staircase.

Petunia just looked up at him, trying to summarize the situation in a way that makes sense. ""My sister, she and her husband were attacked. Their son survived.""

She held out the letter to him. She could only imagine what was running through Vernon's mind as he glanced between the letter and the wild looking toddler.

""We're not keeping him, we already have a child of our own,"" he said sternly.

""I don't want him anymore than you do, but please, Vernon, he doesn't have any other family - Lily is dead -"" she protested. Somewhere above them, Dudley began to wake due to the noise.

Vernon sighed angrily, but with an air of defeat. ""We'll talk about this later, when it's not bloody six in the morning. Bandage the boy's face, if you insist on keeping him. I'm going back to sleep, and I pray that Duddy will too.""

For the next several weeks afterwards, Vernon tried to find an orphanage or adoption agency that would take the boy, but to no avail. Looks like they would be raising the small, scarred, Indian boy themselves."

Likewise, not every story ends with an 'All is well'.

This story begins, as most stories of this nature do, with a boy who is not quite as perfectly normal as the aforementioned Mr. and Mrs. Dursley. No, this boy is very peculiar indeed. (A fact that would no doubt send these perfectly normal Dursleys into a right tizzy.) This remarkably strange boy, on an unremarkably average day, is currently sat on an unremarkable bench by an unremarkable park, waiting for an unremarkable bus. He would seem to all the world like an average boy, that lives an average life, if it weren't for the pale scar that runs down his dark forehead, splintering out like a bolt of lightning. Furthermore, the fact that instead of being accompanied by a similarly dark-skinned father, he's joined by a large black dog would signal to any passerby that perhaps this little boy is not quite as normal as one would presume. The boy is made all the more peculiar by the fact that he seems to be talking to the dog, and not in the way that young children talk to animals, but as if the dog could really understand him. The boy even asks the great beast questions as though it possesses some sort of knowledge other dogs lack and is able to respond to him in kind. Had Mr. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive seen this unorthodox behavior, he would have most likely muttered to himself about the states of kids today and parents who didn't know how to discipline their child. But never mind that boring old Mr. Dursley, because, as all of us In The Know are aware, dogs are quite smart creatures, but none so smart as this young boy's.

Indeed, just at this moment, the dog's ears twitch and he jumps up, waging his tail and looking between the corner and the boy. As the young boy stands the bus rounds the corner and the dog gives an excited yip at the sight. The boy, whose name happens to be Harry James Potter (for those of you that are interested in such things), smiles at the dog and digs into his pockets for his bus pass. With his pass held firmly in hand, he clips a leash to the dog's collar with a look of regret. The dog's tail immediately ceases its excited wagging and his head turns to face the boy with a sad look on his canine face.

""Sorry Padfoot, you can't get on the bus without a leash, you know that,"" comments Harry, scratching behind the dog's ears. Padfoot, as the dog is named, wines and looks at the boy with large, sad grey eyes. Harry pouts at him and crosses his six-year-old arms. ""I can't let you off Padfoot! Uncle Moony will be mad at us, and he won't let us have any chocolate!"" It would perhaps seem strange to a passerby to hear a young boy use such a threat against a dog, for it is common knowledge that dogs cannot eat chocolate. Yet, the boy holds the threat over his dog confidently.

Padfoot seems to shrink down, as though thoroughly chastened by Harry's words and the mention of this 'Uncle Moony'. Harry nods with pleasure and smiles to himself. The unremarkable bus pulls up to the stop with a rather loud screeching of breaks. The doors hiss open and Harry climbs into the vehicle, tugging a reluctant Padfoot along with him, and swipes his bus pass where the bus passes are swiped. He pulls Padfoot along with him as he walks to the back of the bus. Their destination is a long way from the unremarkable park he had been playing in for most of the day.

Harry sits down on the uncomfortable bus seats and Padfoot jumps onto the seat next to him and rests his large head on the boy's leg. Harry looks down and scratches behind his ears.

""I know you don't like the bus, but you can't use your magic or the Min'stry will be mad and they'll send 'rors after us. Moony's almost got it fig'red, then we can Ap'rate all over, and we can get Dad's cloak so we don't ever hafta worry about the Muggles seeing us, and we won't ever hafta use the bus again,"" Harry tells the dog in one long stream-of-consciousness breath that only the youngest of children and the most caffeinated of Uni students can manage. Padfoot huffs and turns away, as though he had heard the argument a million times, yet still doubted it's veracity.

There is no doubt in this author's mind that had someone overheard the boy's words they would not have noticed the dog's strange actions, but rather the strange words the boy had used. Perhaps they would have asked themselves what a Muggle was, and what this 'Min'stry"" and their mysterious ''rors' had to do with it. Luckily for Harry and Padfoot, no one was close enough to have overheard the strange words.

Quite some time later, many miles from the park, Harry disembarks the bus. He is followed not by a large dog, but rather a young man with stylishly long black hair and glimmering grey eyes. No one seems to notice this change of companion, which is perfectly fine with the boy and his guardian. The two of them proceed to walk a ways from the bus stop, turn the corner into a dark alley between an ice cream shop and a bookstore, and promptly disappear with a sound like a car engine backfiring.

Many miles away, in a small village far from the hustle and bustle of the city, a young boy with a lightning scar and a young man with long black hair walk out from behind a particularly old tree near the edge of the bordering forest. None of the inhabitants of said village pay them any mind, except to offer kind smiles and a treat for the young boy. Harry smiles back at them and thanks them for the small cakes and sweets, sharing a few with his guardian. The townsfolk nod at the man and converse about such things that adults feel the need to converse about. One such townsperson, a woman with a penchant for gossip and matchmaking, asks him if he is ever going to find a nice girl to settle down with, and remarks that spending so much time without a mother figure couldn't be good for poor Harry, and had he met Mrs. Harris's niece, she's a beautiful girl and wouldn't he like it if she could add a nice feminine touch to that dreary old cabin he and Mr. Lupin share? The man smiles nervously and subtlety taps Harry on the shoulder, prompting the young boy to yawn as if he were thoroughly exhausted by his busy day, though the young boy still felt energetic. The man smiles at the woman and picks up the boy (who was, in Harry's opinion, far too old to be picked up in such a way, thank-you-very-much, as he was now six and that meant he was a Big Boy) before apologizing. He explains that they had a very long day, and poor Harry really should be getting home for his nap. He carries Harry all the way down the old dirt road toward the small cottage at the edge of the village that they currently inhabited.

The man opens the cottage door and smiles as the smell of home fills his nose. He also smells the distinct scent of stew and fresh baked bread.

""Moony, we're home!"" The man calls, setting down Harry and walking toward the kitchen. Harry takes that as his cue to run to his room and play with his toys.

""Hello Sirius,"" a much taller man with slightly greying brown curls turns and smiles at Sirius when he steps into the cozy kitchen, ""how was the park with Harry?""

""It was great! Harry swung on the swings, and we played fetch, and there was this girl with really bushy hair that came over and to play with us and she gave me part of her sandwich!"" Sirius regales happily. His smile slips into a frown and his eyebrows furrow. ""But then her mum came over and asked Harry where his parents were, and Harry told her they were dead. So she asked where his guardian was, and Harry pointed over to me and told her that I watched him when he played and his uncle Moony watched him at home,"" Sirius sighed and slumps his shoulders. ""I don't like not being able to go out with my godson as myself Moony, and Harry can't keep going out with just Padfoot. More people will start to notice that he doesn't have a parent with him, and not all of them are going to be nice to a young Indian boy,"" Sirius frowns, resting his back against the counter and crossing his arms over his chest.

""I know Pads, but we can't risk someone recognizing you. You know the Ministry has been circulating your face all over the Muggle news channels, not to mention the wizards looking for any sign of you,"" Remus carefully wipes off his hands and reaches out for Sirius, caressing his cheek. Sirius sighs and leans into the touch, closing his eyes. ""As soon as we can figure out how to find Peter, and prove your innocence, you can take Harry out as much as you like,"" Remus leans down and presses a kiss against Sirius's forehead.

""You've been saying that for five years Moons, and we're still no closer to figuring it out,"" Sirius opens his eyes again and stares up sadly into Remus's amber eyes.

""We already have your plea prepared, we just need to find Peter. If we can find him, we can prove you didn't do it,"" Remus reassures him, stroking his long fingers through Sirius's long hair. Sirius laughs coldly and shakes his head.

""Peter could be anywhere in the world. How do you suppose we find one rat in a world of them? Even just one specific rat in England would be difficult,"" Sirius scoffs, ""it'll never work. I'm doomed!"" Sirius sighs dramatically.

""I'd tell you to stop being dramatic, but I don't think you know how, Padfoot,"" Remus smiles, rolling his eyes.

The tall, scarred young man smiles as he remembers his time as an adolescent in a quite remarkable school known as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The school itself is located somewhere in Scotland, though if someone like Mr. Dursley or Mrs. Harris were to attempt to look for it, all they would find is an old castle, crumbling away in the highlands. The reason for this is, if the name itself didn't already give it away, that the school is magic. Rather, there is magic in the school. Special spells have been placed on the grounds so that no Muggle (non-magical folk to answer that question from the bus), can stumble across it by accident. I'm sure you can imagine the mess it would make if some poor unsuspecting Muggle were to wander upon a castle where children ages eleven through eighteen were flying about on brooms and waving around sticks all day. Now, when Remus Lupin and Sirius Black turned eleven they were both accepted into this magical school, along with one James Potter (father of Harry incidentally), Lily Evans (who became Lily Potter), and Peter Pettigrew. I'm sure you know all about the incidents that occurred at Hogwarts between the years 1971 and 1978, so I won't bore you with all the details. As it happens though, our Remus Lupin was, at that very moment, thinking of a very particular event in his life at Hogwarts: the completion of The Marauder's Map.

""That's it!"" Remus exclaims. Sirius sits up and levels him with a confused look. ""The Map! The Marauder's Map!""

""What in the name of Merlin are you talking about?"" Sirius questions him, contemplating if he should call someone to check on Moony's mental health.

""The Map could find him! Or something similar, at least. We wouldn't even need to track everyone, just Peter,"" Remus rushes over to the other side of the kitchen, which is, admittedly, not that far away, and grabs a notebook because honestly, it's ridiculous to expect two twenty-somethings to keep track of sheaves of parchment with a six-year-old around. ""We'd need the original Map of course and our notes. I think I have most of those in some boxes somewhere, and I think James kept his in the Potter vault, so we'd have to go get them, which could be difficult. We'd also need something of Peter's so the spells can hone in on it, then we'd just need to draw some maps to narrow it down and we could-""

""Remus.""

Remus stops and turns back to face Sirius. The twenty-seven year old's face has far too many lines for a man that young, and the defeated expression on his face shows every one of them.

""Remus, we can't get the Map. It's back at Hogwarts in Filch's office after he confiscated it from Peter in seventh year. Even if we could get to it we had two other Marauders helping us when we created the first Map. I don't know if we could do this without them,"" Sirius shakes his head again. ""It's no use, Remus.""

""No,"" Remus strides forward and grips the sides of Sirius's face, tilting it up so he can look directly into the smaller man's grey eyes. ""No, we are not just going to give up. We can find Peter, and we can bring him in, and we'll get him to confess, even if we have to Crucio it out of the rat, and then you can take Harry out to parks and wherever else you want to take him. You can be a proper family that goes on proper holidays and you can take him to Diagon Alley and buy him another broom. We can do this, Sirius,"" Remus brushes a loose strand of hair away from Sirius's face carefully.

""You're wrong,"" Sirius shakes his head, shaking the strand free again. He looks back up at Remus, if you'll pardon the pun, seriously. ""We can be a proper family,"" Sirius smiles at Remus and stretches up to kiss him lightly on the lips. Remus smiles into the kiss and pulls him closer, kissing him slightly harder.

""Eeeww!"" Harry's high six year old voice breaks the relative silence and the two adults step away from each other and look to the doorway, where Harry is standing with a grossed out look on his face, for as you must know, it is never fun to see adults kissing, especially when it's your parental figures. He clutches a stuffed stag with small little circular glasses to his chest.

""C'mere Prongslet!"" Sirius says, crouching down and picking up Harry, despite the child's squealing protests and valiant efforts to avoid his godfather's arms. Sirius rests him on his hip and gives Harry a calculating look as the young child sticks out his tongue at him. ""What do you think Moony,"" he turns to the other man and smirks, ""shall we have venison tonight?""

Now, Harry, being six, has no idea what 'venison' means, though he can conclude, as can you if you are unfamiliar with the term, that it roughly translates to 'six-year-olds named Harry Potter'.

""I don't know Padfoot, he looks a little scrawny,"" Remus responds, considering Harry's figure. ""Perhaps we should fatten him up a little more,"" Remus tickles Harry's sides and smiles at the young boy, who turns his pout to Uncle Moony, deciding Uncle Padfoot has already endured it enough and surely Uncle Moony needs to be properly chastened for his comments.

""You're absolutely right Moony, he does look a bit thin. Short too, don't you think?"" Sirius's grey eyes glint in a way that, had he still been at Hogwarts, would have meant he had just pulled off a truly marvelous prank on his brother and his fellow Slytherins. ""I think we should do something about that, don't you?"" Sirius grips Harry by the legs and flips him upside down, shaking him slightly and causing the boy to squeal in delight. Fortunately, Remus knows Sirius's mind and had the foresight to remove Harry's glasses from his face before Sirius flipped him, which otherwise would have resulted in the eye-wear falling to the floor and breaking. Again. However, this doesn't stop Harry from losing his grip on his deer, or for the subsequent fall endured by said deer.

Remus picks up the toy and sets it carefully on the kitchen counter. He watches them with a fond smile on his scarred face as Harry squeals.

""Moony, I do believe we need another opinion on how edible this young boy is.""

""But of course!"" Remus takes Harry from Sirius with a grin and watches as his figure seems to shimmer, and then suddenly a large black dog is standing where Sirius just was. ""Come on Padfoot!"" Remus lowers Harry, despite the child's screams and squeals, and the large dog bounds up to him, licking at face energetically.

""Stop! Stop, Padfoot!"" Harry laughs, wiping at his face, swinging slightly with the movement. The large dog sits back on his haunches and watches with a tilted head as Remus sets Harry down. There is a moment, one of those moments best described as the calm before the storm, where Remus makes eye contact with the dog and a sense of dread fills him.

""Padfoot, no!"" Remus says, attempting to avoid his fate, but it's too late. The large dog bounds forwards and collides with Remus, sending him through the doorway onto the floor of the living room. Remus laughs as the dog covers his face with kisses, though his nose wrinkles at the dog breath, despite the fact that the dog is, in fact, a person. Harry launches himself at the werewolf (because there is no possible way that a man with the name 'Remus Lupin' is not a werewolf) and attacks his sides with his tiny fingers. Remus roars with laughter as his body constricts from the over-stimulation of the six-year-old fingers digging into his ribs.

A cough sounds from the fireplace behind them and suddenly Remus has the full weight of a five foot eight inch man on top of him instead of a full grown German Shepard. He groans and pushes Sirius off him and he tilts his head back.

The upside-down head of Arthur Weasley greets him. Remus, as well as Sirius and Harry, picks himself up and grins apologetically at Arthur.

""I do hope I'm not interrupting a family bonding moment,"" the disembodied head of a portly ginger man says from the green light of their fireplace.

""Not at all, Arthur. You know we always enjoy your check-ins,"" Remus responds smoothly.

""What do we owe the pleasure, this time?"" Sirius asks, having hefted Harry onto his hip and wordlessly and wandlessly Accio'd the child's glasses from the kitchen counter Remus left them on.

""Molly was wondering if you'd like to come round for supper on Saturday. Ron's been asking after Harry and Percy wanted to ask Remus a few more questions about what to expect at Hogwarts,"" Arthur chuckles and his head turns in a way that, had it been attached to his shoulders, would have translated into an amused shake. ""He doesn't trust his brothers enough to ask them, smart lad. Wouldn't be surprised if he ended up in Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor if I'm being honest. And the twins always love it when you come round.""

""Of course we'll be there, Arthur,"" Remus smiles.

""Fantastic! I'll just go tell Molly then!"" His head starts to disappear but comes back suddenly as he remembers another message he is supposed to deliver. His bodiless head turns to face Sirius straight on and his expression is far more serious than before. ""Oh, and before I forget, Dumbledore said he might have a lead on how to prove your innocence. Nothing definitive yet, he just thought you ought to know."" With that, the fireplace roars green and the flames die back down to their more natural orange.

""That's what, the fifth time this year Dumbledore's had a lead?"" Sirius remarks dryly. Remus nods in agreement.

""You know he was fond of James and Lily. He wants Peter found as much as we do,"" Remus reminds him, though at this point the words have become as stale as month old crackers.

""Are we gonna see Ron?"" Harry asks excitedly from his perch on Sirius's hip. The former Black heir, for that is one of the many things Sirius is, sets him down on the floor and kneels in front of him.

""That we are Harry! We're going over to see Ron and Ginny and all the other Weasley's on Saturday!"" Sirius explains, just as excited at the six-year-old.

""What day is today, Harry?"" Remus asks, kneeling down beside Sirius.

Harry worries at his bottom lip in six-year-old concentration.

""Today is Wednesday because we went to the park, and we go to the park on Wednesdays and sometimes Sundays,"" Harry proclaims proudly. Remus grins at him encouragingly.

""That's right, Harry! Today is Wednesday, and we're going to the Weasley's on Saturday. How many days is that?"" Remus prompts. Sirius holds up his hand for Harry to count on and both of the adults watch as Harry carefully touches a tiny finger to Sirius's much larger ones.

""Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday!"" Harry exclaims as he counts on Sirius's hand. ""That's four days! 'cept it's three and a half 'cause today's Wednesday and it's almost over!"" Harry beams at Remus and Sirius, the latter of whom grins right back and holds up his other hand for his godson to high five. He does, cheerfully at that.

""That's right Bambi. Just three and a half days and you get to see your friends again,"" Sirius reassures him. Harry considers this statement, then frowns and shakes his head.

""No, 'cause I've got loads of friends! There's Ron and Ginny and Fred and George and Percy and Charlie and Bill, and I'll see them Saturday. But there's also 'Moine and Dean and Alec and Lisa and Frankie, and I don't see them all the time, only sometimes on Wednesdays and sometimes Sunday if I'm extra special good. And I don't see them all the time, 'cause sometimes they're not at the park and sometimes we go to different parks. But that's okay, 'cause if we don't we'd get caught and you and Moony would hafta go away with the 'rors,"" Harry's large green eyes, so like his mother's, look up at his guardians widely. ""And then I'd hafta live with Aunty Petunia and Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley, and I don't like them!""

""Don't worry Prongslet, we won't let that happen,"" Sirius reassures him after exchanging a worried and slightly amused look with Remus. Harry just grins at them.

""I know!"" He tells them, skipping away happily to his room in that way young children do.

The look shared between Remus and Sirius this time has lost the amused part and is just worried.

Now, if you remember I said that stories begin in many ways and blah blah blah. Well, on that note, this story's true beginning is not with a remarkable young boy and his remarkable dog waiting for an unremarkable bus by an unremarkable park. This story has many beginnings before that, and even many beginnings after, but the real beginning of this particular story happened on October 31st, 1981. As you most likely already know, that was the night Lily Potter nee Evans and James Potter were killed via the Killing Curse by one Tom Riddle, more commonly known as Lord Voldemort, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, or You-Know-Who. This left poor little Harry Potter, only a year old, without his parents.

Now, here's the interesting part of this familiar story. There was a moment, a blink and you'll miss it moment, where Harry's life could have gone a completely different direction. He could have ended up in a basket on his Aunt Petunia's doorstep with a note from Albus Dumbledore. He could have grown up in an abusive house and rarely felt love until the age of eleven. This Harry would be angry, scared, and most likely very reckless. Luckily for Harry, his life did not end up that way, I mean could you even imagine?

No, luckily for Harry his godfather Sirius Black is not a complete idiot and Apparated away from the scene of the crime after Peter cut off his finger and blasted the street, killing those Muggles. Also luckily for Harry, Remus Lupin happened to be at home on the night of Halloween and was there when Sirius discovered Peter's betrayal. Unfortunately, Harry was still taken to his Aunt and Uncle's house in Surrey, but with the combined prowess of two Marauders and the xenophobia of his aunt and uncle - who did not want to raise a half-Indian child, much less one with magic - he was spirited away before a full week had passed.

Unluckily for Harry, there were other Muggles on that street that saw Sirius and, before they were Obliviated, told the Aurors they saw a man with long black hair point a wooden stick at the man he called Peter right before the blast took out the street. This, of course, means that the Ministry is on the lookout for the traitor Black, who sold out his friends and murdered poor Peter Pettigrew and is now on the run with known associate Remus Lupin.

Luckily for all three of them, no one in the Wizarding world was aware they had the Boy Who Lived with them.

November 28th, 1981 found Remus Lupin and Padfoot with a year old Harry in the field surrounding the Burrow, the magically enlarged house belonging to the Weasley family. While they only really knew each other in passing at Hogwarts, the way many housemates did, the two of them had heard a great many things about Molly Prewett and her husband Arthur Weasley from the Prewett twins, Fabian and Gideon. They were hoping the fellow Gryffindors would hear out their story instead of immediately calling the Ministry and sending Aurors after them.

Padfoot pads along behind Moony, the tall grass passing by in shades of grey as they carefully make their way toward the Weasley's front door. Remus's head is almost constantly twisting around to watch their back and check for someone following them. One hand grips Harry's back and keeps the sleeping child to his chest, and the other keeps a tight grip on his wand. Padfoot's own hackles are raised and his ears are constantly twitching around, listening for out of place sounds. They are habits left over from the war they only just escaped and, not even a month after the unfortunate circumstance that brought about that end, they have yet to rid themselves of those habits.

""Remember, as soon as you hear Arthur at the door, transform back. Not a moment earlier, not a moment later,"" his eyes flick down at the dog briefly before scanning their surroundings again. ""Understood?""

Padfoot nods his head and watches as Remus's shoulders relax for a fraction of a second before tensing again. The large dog's head looks around and his nose twitches again as he scents their surroundings, but there's nothing unusual. Remus turns down a dirt path toward the mismatched house Sirius's distant cousins inhabit. Remus shifts Harry carefully in his arms so as not to disturb the sleeping child, for the screams the tiny lungs could unleash could summon the Aurors all the way in London. They both pause before the Weasley front door and Remus hovers a fist over the wooden door, glancing down at Padfoot. Remus knocks twice and Padfoot's ears twitch as they listen for footsteps. Heavy steps approach the door and Sirius shifts back to human form just as Arthur Weasley opens his front door.

""Remus? What?"" His blue eyes flicker over to the man beside him and he pales, taking a step back. ""Siri-""

""He's innocent!"" Remus interrupts. ""It's okay, he's innocent, I promise!"" Arthur looks back to Remus and finally notices the sleeping child in his arms.

""Is that-?""

""It's Harry,"" Remus nods and looks over Arthur's shoulder into the house, then behind him into the open field. ""May we come inside? It's too exposed out here for what we need to tell you.""

Sirius has kept his grey eyes on the field and road behind them since the moment Arthur opened the door.

""I, er, well, that is to say, uh, I suppose?"" Arthur's eyes keep flickering between Harry, Sirius, and Remus as he stutters.

""Thanks Arthur, we'll try to be brief,"" Remus says as he shoulders into the house, Sirius following him quickly, leaving Arthur to close the door behind them.

""Who was that, dear?"" Molly Weasley asks as she steps into the entry, looking down at her apron as she wipes her hands.

""Hello, Mols,"" Sirius greets her happily. Molly's head snaps up and her mouth falls open. Remus sighs and shakes his head, hands already moving to cover Harry's ears. ""Now, before you say anything-""

""SIRIUS BLACK! IN MY HOUSE! YOU MURDEROUS TRAITOR! HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING TO YOUR BEST FRIEND?! AND NOW YOU DARE WALK INTO MY HOME AS IF YOU AREN'T WANTED BY THE MINISTRY! AND HOW DO YOU GREET ME? AS IF WE WERE FRIENDS!"" Molly's face has gone as red as her hair as she yells at Sirius. The young man shrinks down at the words like a slowly deflating balloon. She takes another breath but before she can, Remus has handed a crying Harry to his godfather and stands in between the angry woman and the man he loves. His expression is cold and murderous.

""Listen to me Molly Weasley, and listen carefully. Sirius is completely innocent of all charges laid against him. He would never, NEVER, have betrayed James or Lily like that, and if you remember anything from our time at Hogwarts you would know that. He's Harry's godfather for Merlin's sake! Do you really think he would do that to Harry?"" Remus's voice is eerily calm as he stares Molly down.

Two young boys, a few years older than Harry, waddle into the room, their brown eyes wide and their red hair fluffy. Their wide eyes flicker between their parents and the two strangers in their home. They briefly rest on a sniffling Harry before returning to their father's face.

""Mum was yellin',"" the boy on the left says as he grips his twin's hand.

""Ron got scared,"" the other twin said.

Arthur kneels down and looks his sons in the eyes. ""It's alright, boys. Why don't you go up and play with your brothers, alright?"" The boys glance at Remus and Sirius one last time before nodding as they leave the room.

""Let's move this to the kitchen,"" Arthur suggests, standing back up and gesturing over to the room Molly just came from. Molly chases after him, her voice low as she whispers at him sharply, but both Sirius and Remus can hear her.

""Honestly, Arthur you can't just invite a wanted criminal into our home!"" She scolds him, glancing nervously back at them.

""Molly, you know how close Black and Potter were at Hogwarts. Do you really think he would have done what the Ministry says he did?"" Arthur whispers back.

""But he's a Black!"" Molly hisses back at him.

""And so was my mother!"" Arthur responds, voice no longer quiet.

""I think you'll find, Molly dearest, that I am, in fact, only a Black in name and that it has been this way since I was sixteen,"" Sirius responds, brushing past her into the kitchen. Her cheeks flame again.

Of course, dear reader, it could be said that Sirius Black stopped being a Black the moment he was sorted into Gryffindor, but that is neither here nor there.

""Please, do sit down. We'd love to hear your side of what happened,"" Arthur tells them, gesturing to the empty seats at the table. Remus looks at Sirius and Harry and frowns.

""Could we perhaps let Harry play with your children? I'd prefer it if he weren't here for this,"" Remus asks them with a smile. ""I'll take him up,"" he adds at Molly's suspicious glance at Sirius.

""Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt,"" Molly acquiesces, sparing another glance to Sirius.

""Sirius, would you mind starting while I take Harry to-?"" Remus looks at Molly and Arthur for guidance.

""Bill's room. Fourth floor,"" Molly replied.

""To Bill's room. I'll be back in just a moment,"" Remus smiles and leans down to take Harry from Sirius and to give Sirius a soft kiss on the forehead. He smiles again as he leaves the room.

Sirius clears his throat once Remus is gone and stares down at the table for a moment before looking up at Arthur and Molly.

""I'm very sorry about Fabian and Gideon, Mols. I meant to owl after I heard, but there was no time. They were good people,"" Sirius focuses on Molly and watches as her eyes grow sad. ""We lost a lot of good people in this war, a lot of friends and family,"" he looks down at the table again and wrings his hands. ""I'm sure you both are aware that we believed there was a traitor in the Order,"" he looks up and catches their nods. ""Dumbledore and Moody believed that it had to be one of the Marauders, given the information that was leaked to the Death Eaters. It seemed ridiculous at first, but it was war. None of us suspected James or Lily, of course, not when their son was You-Know-Who's target. And no one believed Peter able of betraying his only friends. After Hogwarts, Remus and I moved in together, so we knew each other's movements better than anyone. Remus began to leave for long stretches of time, and he wouldn't tell me where he would go or what he was doing. I grew suspicious, Remus's odd behavior coupled with the knowledge that one of us was the traitor..."" Sirius shakes his head sadly.

""Most of the Order thought the traitor had to be Sirius,"" Remus adds as he reenters the room. ""Like you said Molly, he's a Black."" Molly at least has the decency to look ashamed. ""Dumbledore had me going on secret missions where I would be gone weeks at a time, sometimes months, and it seemed every time I came back home Sirius was more and more closed off from me. With the rumors circulating, I thought the worst,"" Remus's mouth twists into a bitter frown. ""It didn't help that we had a rat whispering doubts into our ears, pitting us against each other so we wouldn't suspect the real culprit."" Remus clenches his fists and breathes deeply. Sirius rests a hand over his and squeezes.

""When James and Lily were forced into hiding, Dumbledore suggested a Fidelis Charm to keep their location secret. James asked me to be his Secret Keeper, but I knew I would be the obvious choice. I was afraid the Death Eaters would force it out of me, so I told them to pick Peter since I didn't trust Remus at the time. I thought no one would think James would pick Peter over his best friend. I thought Peter was a safe choice.""

""On Halloween night Sirius stormed into the apartment, bloody and frantic, rambling about Peter's flat being ransacked and Peter gone. Before I could even begin fixing all of his injuries he had fled the apartment and,"" Remus glances at Arthur, knowing he worked for the Improper Use of Muggle Artifacts Department in the Ministry but figured if he could keep Sirius's whereabouts secret, he keep this one, too, ""got on his flying motorcycle to warn James and Lily."" Remus's grip on Sirius's hand tightens.

""It was still smoking when I got there. The roof over Harry's room had been blown completely off, rubble littered the street. I ran inside,"" Sirius squeezes his eyes shut. ""James was- his body was still by the door. He didn't even have his wand, the stupid prick. I could hear Harry crying in his room, so I ran upstairs. He was in his crib and his head was bleeding. Lily was crumpled in front of the crib and He-Wh- Voldemort,"" he ignores Molly and Arthur's gasps, ""was still lying in front of her, his wand still in his hand."" Sirius's jaw clenches and his grip tightens.

""I sent a Patronus to Dumbledore immediately and followed Sirius there. When I got there, he was arguing with Hagrid, who was sent to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle's house, despite the fact that Sirius was his Godfather and thus had rightful custody of him. Sirius handed me Harry and told me to take care of his bike, then left. Hagrid,"" Remus breathes in sharply, still angry at the half-giant, ""he took Harry away, said I had no legal claim to him and that Dumbledore thought it would be best for him to be with family. As if Sirius and I aren't his family, if not by blood then by bond!""

Sirius rests a gentle hand on Remus's arm and continues their tale, ""I went after Peter. Confronted him. The rat knew I would come after him and had a plan ready. I had only just drawn my wand when Peter cut off his bloody finger and blasted the street to bits. I Apparated away before the Aurors could arrive and fled to an old hideout that I knew Remus would be waiting in.""

""We went after Harry a few days later and Petunia happily handed him over. Petunia and her husband Vernon are the worst kind of Muggles, even by their standards. They didn't want anyone to know their nephew was half-Indian, so they kept him in a cupboard under the stairs. We took him away from them and we've been running pretty much ever since, staying in various Muggle towns and avoiding Wizards as much as we can. Sirius and Harry are far too recognizable, and after the Ministry gave his photo to the Muggle police it's been hard to stay unrecognized. We owled Dumbledore and explained the switch and that we needed a place to hide until we can find somewhere for ourselves. He told us to come to you.""

""We don't mean to impose, but we don't really have a better option. It would only be for a few months, three tops,"" Sirius adds, giving them his best puppy dog eyes, which are, to be fair, very impressive.

""How exactly are we supposed to believe you?"" Molly demands. As she speaks there is a tapping at the kitchen window.

""That should be the owl Dumbledore said he'd send,"" Remus comments, standing from the kitchen table and opening the window. A large grey owl hops onto his arm and Remus takes the letter from its beak, wincing when it nips him. ""Here you go Molly,"" he hands her the letter, ""where do you keep your owl treats? Oh, never mind, I've found them."" He reaches up and takes down a glass container full of small treats from the owl.

Sirius waits in tense silence as Molly and Arthur read over Dumbledore's words, hands twisting together nervously in his lap. When they finally set down the letter he watches them carefully.

""I suppose we could find a spare cot or two,"" Molly acquiesces, sharing a look with Arthur.

Remus and Sirius exchange relieved glances and both of their shoulders finally relax."

 (Or rather, of Hagrid) 

This story starts on a perfectly normal Sunday, on a perfectly normal street, in a perfectly normal house. The particular house in question was nearly imperceptible from the rows upon rows of cookie-cut houses, but we shall begin with the one labeled Number Four.

Within the perfectly normal Number Four lived the equally normal Dursleys. The Dursleys were the sort of people who you'd least expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, simply because they didn't put up with such nonsense.

Vernon Dursley worked at a company called CoreWorth, which made and sold investments. He was a rather large man, and reminded many of an unholy offspring between an elephant seal and a silverback gorilla. Petunia Dursley was a tall woman made of sharp angles and double the normal allowance of a neck (which came in very useful when she decided to peep on the neighbors). The last of the Dursleys was Dudley Dursley, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley's son, whom they believed to be the finest boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, and yet, they had a terrible secret. Their worst fear was the discovery of this secret, of their connection to the Potters. Lily Potter was Petunia's younger sister, but Petunia hadn't had any contact with her as long as she could prevent it. In fact, Mrs. Dursley liked to pretend that she didn't have a sister, because freakish Lily Potter and her freakish husband were as strange and as unnatural and as Un-Dursleyish as it was possible to be.

The Dursleys shuddered to imagine what the neighbors would think if the Potters arrived on the street. For years Petunia had prayed at St. Catherine's Mercy, desperate for misfortune to fall upon her sister and her freakish family to prevent such an act. And of course, what had to happen except Mrs. Dursley's mother to call, elated, with news of Lily's pregnancy.

A new witch in the family, how wonderful! She had said. Petunia had slammed the phone down onto the receiver and pretended that it didn't hurt that her own mother preferred a freak's pregnancy over Petunia's own.

    It wouldn't matter, Petunia had decided, whether her mother loved Lily more; She was fully convinced that the baby would be just as freakish as the Potter seniors, and it served as just another reason for Petunia to keep her family away from them.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke on the perfectly ordinary Sunday where our story starts, there was nothing strange or unnatural about the cloudy, dull sky that could suggest that peculiar things would soon be happening all over the country.

Mrs. Dursley had slipped on a well-used robe that had been a gift from Mr. Dursley, and went to quell the piercing shrieks of her hungry two-year old son. Mr. Dursley simply grumbled and shifted in the queen-size mattress-sag that served as the half of his bed, and went back to sleep. It wouldn't even be till eight-a.m (as Dudley had the nasty habit of waking up at six) that Vernon would be roused by a half-dressed Petunia, and pick out his ugliest tie for Sunday services while Mrs. Dursley gossiped madly away, wrestling with an agitated Dudley.

Unfortunately, or possibly rather fortunately depending on whether or not you were a Dursley, neither Petunia or Vernon seemed to notice the tawny elf owl that was perching precariously outside their window. If they had, then perhaps their day would have gone a bit differently. Perhaps Mrs. Dursley would have shrieked much like her squalling son instead of complaining about the gaudy pearls decorating her neck being fake. Perhaps Mr. Dursley would have insisted upon staying home instead of venturing out as to ensure no more owls or freakish animals appeared near their home. Perhaps if the Dursleys had noticed these things, they would have discarded the small boy they were soon to find on their doorstep, and our story would be going in quite a different direction.

In any case, the Dursleys did not notice the diminutive owl that seemed to glare holes through the two as they each ventured past the bedroom window. Instead, at half-past eight, Mrs. Dursley fought with Dudley's papoose in the car as Mr. Dursley stuck one of many keys into the front doors' keyhole and waddled over to the driver's side. ""Little tyke,"" Mr. Dudley had chortled as Dudley began tantruming, landing a solid thwack! in Petunia's face.

It wasn't until the corner of Privet Drive that Mrs. Dursley noticed the first sign of something unusual. A cat reading a map. At first, Mrs. Dursley couldn't believe her eyes, and jerked her head around to look again. There, on the curb of the street, was a cat, simply sitting. There wasn't a map, let alone a scrap of paper, in sight. What could she have been thinking? She tittered a laugh to herself, gaining an odd look from her husband as they stopped at the stop sign. She stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley began to press again on the peddle and pass the corner to drive up the road Mrs. Dursley watched the cat in the mirror. It was now reading the large stone sign that said Privet Drive--no, it was looking at the sign. Cats couldn't read maps or signs, or anything else for that matter. Mrs. Dursley gently fluffed her coarse hair and put the cat out of her mind, focusing on whether or not she believed Dudley could be old enough to learn anything at Children's Church.

But by the edge of Padstow, where their church was located, Dudley's courses at Children's Church had all but been put out of Petunia's mind. As the Dursleys sat in their usual Sunday morning traffic jam they couldn't help but notice there seemed to be quite a bit of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley began to rave about 'the get-ups you see on young people these days!' as people dressed in anything even slightly unordinary seemed to personally offend him. Mrs. Dursley's face began to pinch with the scowling sneer set up on her face, nodding her head with Vernon's tirade against the 'immigrant influence.' Mr. Dursley began drumming his fingers angrily against the steering wheel as his eyes fell on a huddle of those weirdos standing quite close by. Aliens, they were. He knew. They were whispering excitedly together. 'Probably a terrorist plot,' Mr. Dursley had thought. 

He became especially enraged, so much so that his wife put a hand over his beefy arm in comfort, when he saw that these terrorists weren't young men at all. They were older than Mr. Dursley himself! Wearing ridiculously bright colours; yellows and blues and violets, all with glittering sequins that sparkled with every minimalistic swish (if one with an outfit like that could use a word such as).

Mr. Dursley began to feel the smallest traces of fear roll inside him like the beads of sweat down his temple. Was this some sort of bombing? A distraction? Mrs. Dursley simply cooed at both her husband and her grunting son, assuring them both that it must be part of some silly stunt. Of course! That must be it. A silly stunt. The traffic moved a few minutes later as they arrived into the St. Catherine's parking lot, the elder Dursleys discussing whether it was more beneficial to have Dudley in Children's Church or the Adult's church.

The Dursleys always sat in the fourth row on the isle side because Mr. Dursley worked as an usher (and if a few tithings fell into his pocket during donation, well, that was nobody's business). If he hadn't then perhaps they would had noticed the many owls swooping to and fro past the delicately colored glass windows. As it was, once again, the peculiarity passed them by and went on to be noticed by the passer-bys outside who gazed open-mouthed at the owls that sped overhead. Many of them had never even seen an owl, even at nighttime. Mr., Mrs., and tiny Dudley Dursley, however, had a very normal, owl-free morning. Mr. Dursley pocketed an extra forty-six pounds, Mrs. Dursley gossiped with Mrs. Greer and Mrs. Blanton about Ms. Figg, and Dudley fussed with his seat straps and threw his toys at the people in the row in front. All in all, they were in a very good mood until lunchtime after the first service when they decided to eat out with Vernon's extra pocket money.

They had forgotten all about the freaks in cloaks until they passed by a gaggle of them on the sidewalk next to the Diner. Mr. Dursley eyed them angrily as he and his wife passed by, Mrs. Dursley clutching Dudley's carrier closer to her bust. These freaks made them uneasy. This bunch seemed to be whispering excitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn't spot a single collecting tin these sorts usually carried. It wasn't till they were inside did the Dursleys catch snippets of what was being said by the cloak-clad weirdos infesting the diner (both except Dudley, who was more interested in stealing bites from both his parents' plates). 


""The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard, in Mungo's--""











""Yes, their son Hari--""


Mr. Dursley tripped over a table, nearly sending Petunia sprawling. A waitress rushed over to help him and was knocked away. Mrs. Dursley set Dudley on the table that was uprighted and helped her husband up into a chair. Mr. Dursley began muttering to his wife fearfully, about the you-know-whos and the conversation overhead. Mrs. Dursley simply snipped at him that he was being ridiculous, and that it could be anyone they were speaking about ""with those sorts of people, Vernon. Those people haven't an original thought in their head, let alone names."" Mr. Dursley stroked his mustache and bobbed his head, agreeing. Potter wasn't such an uncommon name, especially for those who stole their way into his good country. He was sure there were several Potters who had a son named Harry, especially those who tried to pass for English. 

Come to think of it, the Dursleys weren't even sure their nephew's name was Harry. It could be Harvey, or Henry, or something just as freakish as they are. Petunia was right; there was no point in worrying (especially when it upset Mrs. Dursley so). He didn't blame her--if he'd had a sister like that.....but all the same, those freaks in cloaks...













They ordered their food from the same flustered waitress whom Mr. Dursley had shoved, and sipped haughtily from their teacups as they arrived. The tray arrived a few minutes later, with Mrs. Dursley's plate of eggs and toast and Mr. Dursley's plates of pancakes, eggs, sausage, and bacon. It took sparingly few minutes before Vernon was finished with his food and Dudley began to squall. His ear piercing cries were ignored by his parents, who left the other patrons to suffer, as Petunia finished her plate and called for the bill.













As they left with the hysterical Dudley in tow, much to the relief of the remaining diners and staff, Mr. Dursley nearly felled a stranger who slammed into him.













""Sorry,"" he grunted, as the tiny man stumbled back. It was a few moments before Mr. Dursley realized the tiny brown man was wearing a glimmering violet cloak. He didn't seem upset at all being nearly knocked to the ground, or by the sour look upon Mr. Dursley's face directed at him. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a (to Mr. Dursley's ears) heavily accented, squeaky voice, ""Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day!""













Petunia violently flinched, and the man had the audacity to hug Mr. Dursley so hard around the middle his nose dug into Mr. Dursley's large stomach.













Mr. Dursley stood frozen in place. He had just been hugged by this--this freak. He also thought he has been called a 'muggle', whatever that was.













'Even if they don't  belong here, still, can't you learn the damn language of the blasted country you're contaminating?' He had thought viciously. 













As the Dursleys pulled past the gates to Privet Drive and back into the driveway of Number Four the first thing Mrs. Dursley saw was the tabby cat she'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on the garden wall corner of Number Four and Number Three. She was sure it was the same one; it was the same silvery-grey colour with black markings around its eyes. Its long, fluffy tail flicked back and forth sharply and it seemed to glare at them as they got out of the car.













""Shoo!"" Mrs. Dursley shrieked, swatting in its direction with the hand not wrapped around Dudley's baby-seat.













The cat didn't move. If anything, its tufted ears laid horizontally from its head and its eyes slid to stern slits. Huffing and trying to pull herself together, Mrs. Dursley followed her husband into the house. She was determined not to let any of this get to her. 













The time at back at their home through dinner was fairly normal. Mr. Dursley spoke about his new investments and how he was expecting a raise quite soon. Mrs. Dursley relayed the gossip learned from Mrs. Greer and Blanton, especially about how Mr. Number Sixteen's wife was apparently leaving him for a younger man. After dinner, when Dudley had been put to bed Mr. and Mrs. Dursley went into the living room to catch the last report on the evening news:













""And finally, bird-watchers everywhere are astounded by the nation's owls' activity today. Owls, who are nocturnal predators, have been seen flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why these birds have suddenly changed their instinctual patterns."" The newscaster plastered a strained grin on his face. ""And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?""













""Well, Ted,"" said the weatherman, ""I don't know about that, but it's not just birds that have been acting batty lately. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a shower of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night a bit early--it's only a few days away folks! But I can promise a wet one tonight.""













Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair, while Mrs. Dursley sat with her long fingernails clutching gouges in the couch cushions. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks invading all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about Potters...













He could feel his forehead flushing and moistening, and knew it was no good. He would have to ask. He cleared his throat nervously.













""Er--Tuney, darling--you haven't heard from your sister lately have you?""













As expected, her gaze snapped over to him, shocked and angry. The teacup currently lying in pieces on the carpet that had been dangling from her hands was a surprise, though. After all, they usually pretended she didn't have a sister.













""No. I haven't even spoken to Mother,"" she said sharply. ""Why?""













""Funny stuff on the news,"" Mr. Dursley mumbled, pointing a round finger vaguely in its direction, ""Owls.....shooting stars... and those people we saw in town today--""













""So?"" snapped Mrs. Dursley.













""Well, I just thought.....maybe.....it was something to do with.....you know.....her crowd."" 













Mrs. Dursley looked like Mr. Dursley had just killed her favourite cat (as if he could do such a thing, since Petunia hated animals), sitting rigidly on the puce coloured couch, breathing hotly through her nose.













He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. However, while Mr. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mrs. Dursley crept to the large bedroom window and peered out to the front garden. The cat was still there. It was now staring down Privet Drive as if waiting for something.













Was she imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with her? If it did.....if it got out that they were related to a--well she didn't think she could bear it.













The Dursleys got into bed. Mr. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mrs. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in her mind. Her last, comforting thought before she fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near her and Mr. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what she and Vernon thought about them and their kind.....she couldn't see how she and Vernon could get mixed up in anything that might be going on--she yawned and turned over--it couldn't affect them...













How very wrong she was.







Mrs. Dursley  might have been drifting off into an easy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no signs of weariness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the entrance corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a dog began barking madly, nor when a small elf owl swooped down and perched on the raised square across from the cat itself. The owl copied the cat's almost lifeless stance and it was nearly midnight before either of them moved.













A man appeared on the corner the animals had been watching, so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed, while the owl's feathers ruffled and it gave a small ""Hoo.""













Nothing like this man had even been seen on Privet Drive, even on Hallow's Eve. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt (that luckily he refrained from). He was wearing long maroon robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was nearly as thin as he was, as well as long and crooked. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.













Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize, or perhaps was simply unbothered, by the fact that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging through the many pockets of his cloak, looking for something. He did seem to realize he was being watched though, as he looked up from his pockets to the cat and from the cat to the owl. For some reason, this seemed to amuse him. He chuckled to himself and muttered, ""I should have known.""













He has seemed to of found what he was looking for as he fished out what seemed to be an intricate, long, silver cigarette lighter. He held it up near his head, and clicked it. The nearest lantern-style street light went out with a muted pop. He clicked it again--another near dozen times--till the nearest eleven street lights were out and the entrance to Privet Drive was shrouded in darkness; the only light being the pinpricks of yellow from an irritant cat's and a curious owl's eyes. He seemed to be satisfied that no one would be able to peep outside their windows onto them, and slipped the strange device back into one of his many pockets.













""Fancy seeing you here, Professors."" he greeted as he sat down on a decorative rock in the road verge. The cat hopped down and strut quickly over to him, as the owl flew strangely skillfully to perch near the strange man.













Before the cat reached him, it morphed into a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing oval spectacles exactly the shape the markings the cat had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her salt-and-peppered hair was drawn into a tight bun, and she looked distinctly ruffled.













""How did you know it was me?"" she asked.













""My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.""













""You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day."" Professor McGonagall sniffed.













""Oh, Minerva! You should have been more inconspicuous."" came a squeaky voice.













A small man, no larger than a six-year old child, was standing next to Albus, all traces of the owl gone. He was wearing a tea coloured conductor-like suit with a yellow half-cape. He had a short mustache and what could be considered a bowl-like haircut.













""Professor Flitwick, I would have thought you'd be celebrating, I must have past at least a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.""













Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily at Dumbledore's insinuation, while Flitwick looked morose.













""Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,"" she said impatiently. ""You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no--even the Muggles have noticed something is going on.""













""Yes, it was on their news,"" Flitwick nodded. ""Flocks of owls, shooting stars.....well they aren't completely oblivious. Shooting stars down in Kent! I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."" he huffed out his nose. 













""You can't blame them,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""We've had precious little to celebrate for a dozen years.""













""But that's no reason to lose our heads,"" McGonagall said irritably. ""People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.""













She threw a sharp glance at Dumbledore, as if she expected him to tell her something, but he didn't and was interrupted before she could start again.













""A fine thing it'd be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all."" Flitwick grinned, his short mustache coming up to tickle his nose (which produced a rather high pitched sneeze).













""So, I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?"" the stern McGonagall seemed almost unsure of herself, which was a very odd and unnatural look upon such a woman.













""It certainly seems so,"" said Dumbledore. ""We have much to be thankful for. Would you like a lemon drop?""













""A what?""













""A lemon drop. They're a type of Muggle sweet I'm fond of.""













""No thank you,"" said McGonagall coldly, as if she didn't think this was quite the time for the talk of lemon drops.













""I'll have one Albus!"" Flitwick raised his arm and outstretched rather long fingers for someone of such a short stature.













""As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone--""













""My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense--for years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort."" Both Professors flinched, though Flitwick's reaction was slightly more comical due to the sour candy in his mouth. ""It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who'. We'd get them all switched,"" he continued, unsticking two lemon drops and pretending not to notice their reactions, ""I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name than any of the others.""













""I know you haven't,"" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. ""But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know-Who--oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.""













""You flatter me,"" said Dumbledore calmly, ""Voldemort had powers I will never have.""













""Half of the You-Know-Who's have! It's only because you're too noble to use them."" said Flitwick.













""It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.""













Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, ""The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?""













""Minerva--"" Flitwick tried to reach out for her, but stopped as she pierced him with a fierce stare.













 It seemed that she had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat or as a woman had she fixed either of her companions with such a look as she was trading between them. Dumbledore, however, chose not to answer. Instead, he was choosing another lemon drop.













""What they're saying,"" she pressed on, ""is that last night Voldemort turned up in Saint Mungo's. He went to find the Potters and the Longbottoms. The rumor is that Lily and James, and Alice are--are--that they're--dead.""













Dumbledore bowed his head. Flitwick laid his head along McGonagall's robes and pat her back. McGonagall gasped.













""Lily and James.....I can't believe it.....I didn't want to believe it.....Oh poor Frank...""













Shining tears slid down her face as Dumbledore reached out and patted her shoulder. ""I know.....I know..."" he said heavily.













Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. ""That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Longbottom boy, Neville, and the Potter boy, Hari. But--he couldn't. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill the first boy, Neville Longbottom, Voldemort's power somehow broke, and that's why he's gone.""













Dumbledore nodded glumly.







""It's--It's true?"" faltered Professor McGonagall. ""After all he's done.....all the people he's killed.....he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding.....of all the things to stop him.....but how in the name of Circe did Neville survive? And what of the Potter boy, Hari? How did Neville possibly save himself, let alone another child?""













""We can only guess,"" said Dumbledore. ""We may never know.""







Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles, leaning on Professor Flitwick as much as she could. Flitwick rubbed what of her back he could reach soothingly, murmuring soft words. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden pocket watch from one of his pockets and examined it. It was a very odd watch, with twelve hands pointing at planets instead of numbers that moved around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, as in any case he placed it back in a pocket and said ""Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way.""













""I followed Filius, whom Hagrid told,"" she sniffed. ""And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here of all places?""













""I've come to bring Hari to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.""













Both Flitwick and McGonagall protested at once.













""You don't mean--you can't mean the people who live here?""













""Dumbledore--you can't. I've been watching this house all day--""













""And I've followed them!""







""--You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son--I saw him kicking all the way up the street, screaming for sweets!""













""And what about his skin? These people are even more bigoted than the Morden family!""













Flitwick ended with a huff, while McGonagall gestured her hands to him, nodding vigorously. 













""It's the best place for him,"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.""













""A letter?"" repeated Flitwick faintly, while McGonagall muttered something that sounded suspiciously like ""Oh goody.""













""Really Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous! A legend brother to Neville! I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Miracle Boy Day in the future--there will be books written of them--every child in our world will know their names!""













""Exactly,"" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. ""It would be enough to turn any boy's head. In another's shadow before he can walk and talk! Half-famous for something he can't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?""













Flitwick opened his mouth, changed his mind, and swallowed, leaving McGonagall to intervene. ""Yes--yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here?"" She eyed his cloak as if he might be hiding Hari underneath the folds.













""Hagrid's bringing him.""













""You think it--wise--to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"" Flitwick's nose crinkled unsurely.













""I would trust Hagrid with my life,"" said Dumbledore.













""I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,"" Flitwick said grudgingly, ""but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to--what was that?""













A loud rumbling sound had broken the silence surrounding them. It grew steadily louder as McGonagall and Flitwick looked up and down the street for signs of a headlight with Dumbledore smiling fondly; it swelled to a roar as they all looked up at the sky--and a huge motorcycle seemed to fall out of the air and land on the street in front of them.













If the motorcycle was large, it was nothing compared to the man sitting astride it. He was nearly twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild--long tangles of bushy brown hair and beard his most of his face, his hands were the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather-looking boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of multi-coloured blankets.










""Hagrid,"" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ""At last. And where did you get the motorcycle?""




















""Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,"" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. ""Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.""

















""No problems, were there?""

















""No, sir--hospital was mostly destroyed, but I got 'im out 'fore folks starting swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.""

















Hagrid held his arms low, so that Flitwick could see when McGonagall and Dumbledore bent over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of wild, jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

















""Dumbledore, what is that?"" whispered Professor McGonagall.

















""A backlash from Neville's magic. The poor boy's face is near half scarred. He'll have it for the rest of his life. They both will.""

















""Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"" questioned Flitwick.

















""Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well--give him here, Hagrid--we'd better get this over with.""

















Dumbledore took Hari in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.

















""Could I--could I say good-bye to 'im, sir?"" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over and gave Hari what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss, as the babe began to wrinkle his face up. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

















""Shhh!"" hissed Professor Flitwick, putting a long, bony finger up to his mouth.

















""You'll wake the Muggles, Rubeus!"" Professor McGonagall laid a comforting arm on the large man, trying to hush him.

















""S-s-sorry,"" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a very large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. ""But I c-c-can't stand it--Lily an' James dead--and poor little Hari off ter live with Muggles--""

















""Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,"" Professor Flitwick whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore flicked his wrist towards a wrought-iron gate and stepped through, following the pathway to the front door. He shifted the boy in his arms and bent over, placing one of the old milk bottles in front of the door just in the center of the doormat. A flick of his wrist and a slim piece of wood fell into his fingers. A whispered word, and a milk bottle morphed into a small wicker basket with a purple pillow inside. He laid the babe onto the pillow and reached into his pocket, placing the letter he found there in plain view. Another flick of his wand, another word, ensured that the letter would stick.

















He walked back to the trio, where one by one they took turns placing enchantments on the boy. McGonagall made sure the boy would stay protected from any animals that happened to lurk nearby, with a small crystalline dome that shone if you looked at it just right. Flitwick magicked small charms that looked to be fireflies, ensuring the boy would stay warm throughout the night (due to Hagrid's request, as he was not legally allowed to do magic), and a small, modified notice-me-not charm. Hagrid gave one last, not so small good-bye, and stuffed a clean handkerchief around the boy's sides, and then returned to the corner.

















For a full minute the four of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, McGonagall blinked furiously, Flitwick stifled sniffles, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes had seemed to of gone out.

















""Well,"" said Dumbledore finally, ""that's that."" We've no business staying here, We may as well go and join the celebrations.""

















""Yeah,"" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, ""I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall--Professor Flitwick--Professor Dumbledore, sir.""

















Wiping his eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.

















""I shall see you soon, I expect, Professors,"" said Dumbledore, nodding to the remaining duo. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply, while Professor Flitwick nodded mutely.

















Dumbledore stood and walked back down the street. On the corner he took out the strange cigarette-lighter looking device. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back into their street lamps just suddenly enough he could make out a strange cat slinking around the corner. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of Number Four.

















""Good luck, Hari,"" he murmured, as an elf owl swooped overhead. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

















A breeze ruffled the flora of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy underneath the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Hari Potter rolled over in his blankets, one hand clutching at the unmoving letter. He would sleep on, not knowing he was famous, not knowing was special, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours by the horrified shrieks of one Mrs.Dursley. He couldn't know that at this very moment, one Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, had signed Hari's fate in a life of hell.

Echo of a Memory


(Or rather, a Song)


He had been having the dream again. The one of darkness with a soft humming from a lady he didn't know, following the tinkling notes that came from above. The one where he was wrapped tightly. Warmly. Safely. And then he was picked up by large, soft hands that held him close and whispered, ""We love you, Hari."" The one that caused him to forget himself and sing softly in the bathroom when he thought Ms. Petunia was in the other room, resulting in a sharp smack that had his head cracking against the hard bathtub.

Hari was four now, not that he knew that. The Dursleys seldom let him know the time of the day, let alone which number it was on the calendar (as if they would have told him anyway). He was a smart boy, and sometimes, very privately, almost proud of himself. He knew how to make the coffee and breakfast, how to scrub the tiles and the granite of the house till it shone, and how to do most of the laundry all by himself.

These were things that made the Dursleys happy. Things that didn't get him in trouble. He had learned the hard way what happened when he didn't do his chores right, or if he didn't finish them in time. He still had a large scar on his left leg where the Dursleys allowed Dudley to see how many times Hari could be pushed down the stairs before he stopped getting up.

Now he sat in his small room, a cupboard, to be precise, pushing the pain away from his most recent punishment. He didn't know the difference between a cupboard and a proper room, since it was the only thing he could ever remember staying in.

'Liar,' a voice whispered in the back of his mind. His dream. He could remember being held by something large and soft, like the baby-bed he was learning to make up for the baby Petunia was going to have soon.

 'But it was a dream and dreams are nonsense and nonsense gets me punished,' Hari told the voice fervently. 

Nonsense did get Hari punished, especially when it was Hari's special sort of nonsense. The first time, he had been reprimanded because he dropped a plate. His face had stung awfully, and his nose began to bleed all over the carpet. He knew the bleeding would mean more punishment, since it was him who made the mess, until the blood was just--gone. Gone from his face, the carpet, the scraps he wore as clothes--it was all gone. 

That night Hari had his first ever broken bone, if you didn't count his nose, as punishment for his special nonsense.

And now, he was arguing with a voice in his head that suggested he use his special thing to fix his arm. Hari was curled protectively around it atop a worn dishmat over the floor, whimpering quietly. 

It was another thing he had almost mastered: silence. Whether it was creeping around at night to steal drinks of water his companion had convinced him they needed, or crying in his cupboard as to not wake the Dursleys.

His companion had also been teaching him something else in the silence. He called it magic. It was how he opened the outside locks from the inside of his cupboard and made sure not even Ms. Petunia could find fault in his cleaning.













His voice was trying to teach him how to use magic to fix his arm. Hari had tried, but it only made it glow slightly before the pain faded for a few hours. It came back in full force when he was thrown in his room because of his singing.













 'Try again,' his companion hissed. His voice was, Hari imagined, like the snakes he would spy on the telly sometimes. 'Imagine your arm whole again. Fill it with your magic.' 













Hari tried again. He thought about being able to move his arm, being pain-free, being as close as he could be to healthy again. He didn't even get a glow this time.













 'I don't know how!'  













He imagined his companion rearing up like a snake and hissing. He wasn't angry, not at Hari. Hari could tell. He could feel his companion sliding around in his head, as if he was looking for something. Hari didn't know what he could be looking for, since Companion seemed to be a lot smarter than Hari was.













 'Feel it. In the air. It's thick, like cloth. Imagine it as a colour. Give it essence--it isn't inanimate.'













Hari didn't quite know what inanimate meant, but he did as told to the best of his abilities. He closed his eyes and tried to imagine his magic around him. He knew what it felt like due to the precious few times he had been able to use it, and almost flinched when he felt a massive presence draping across him. It felt dark green, like a lizard! He giggled quietly to himself and felt soft, affectionate pats in his mind at his observation. It stretched to the entirety of his room, yet seemed suffocated, as if it was containing itself.













 '.....it's big.' Hari marvelled to Companion.













'Yes,' Companion sounded strange. 'You will only grow stronger. But for now, you must learn how to use it. Imagine your magic filling your arm and making it white.' 













 'White? Is brown bad?' Hari looked at his arms self-consciously. He didn't know what to do if Companion thought he was ugly too.













'Not like that, young one. White light. Like....a lightbulb.' His companion didn't seem to like lightbulbs, the way he sneered its' name. Hari was surprised and fell against the crude wall when he suddenly saw pictures before his eyes, like a vivid telly in his head. 













He took calming, silencing breaths before he copied the pictures that had been pushed to the forefront of his mind. He gathered small bits of his magic that he knew how to handle and pushed it through his fingertips. He imagined a sort of wall stopping it at his elbow, so that his magic could fill up his arm until it reached his wrist. Then he made it turn white.














'Now repeat after me: Therapavo.'














"":Therapavo.:"" He didn't even notice he wasn't speaking english; he was too distracted by his arm being jerked back into place and a sharp snap that echoed off the splintered walls. His eyes saw pitch black for a moment before all the pain radiating from his arm was gone. 













 'It's.....it's fixed,' as if Hari couldn't believe it himself.













 'I told you that you could do it. Do not doubt me again.' His companion sounded both irritated and smug. 'Now, you need food.' 













Hari could feel what he could only think of as heavily huffs of breath inside his head, as if his Companion had just ran away from Mr. Vernon's sister, Mrs. Nelson's, dog Razor.













 'I just made dinner. I have to wait until tomorrow....Are you okay?' 













'I am--tired,' Companion said carefully. 'It takes a lot of my magic to show you things.'









'So it's hard?'









'It is not--hard!' Hari's companion sounded offended. He shifted inside the boy's mind slowly. 'It is irrelevant. You need food or you will become weak. If you become weak you will die, and I will not allow that.'













Hari felt something he hadn't ever felt before. Someone cared for him. He didn't know precisely why, or realize that if he died then so would his companion (and perhaps that was the reason he mentored Hari so), Hari just knew that someone cared if he didn't live anymore. He felt a metaphorical bond form between himself and his companion as he hissed the magic word Alohomora and crept out of his room.













He peeked around the corner of the stairs and listened very carefully for breathing. He could hear the telly going in the living room being muffled by Dudley's loud laughter. Petunia would be on bedrest now after each meal, and Vernon was away at work. Hari slid around the corner and tiptoed across the large, open hall that served as a midway from the living room, the dining room, and his goal: the kitchen.













He dove for the island cabinets and braced himself against the back of it as heavy footsteps thudded towards the fridge. Hari was hiding under the lid of the cabinet as Dudley ransacked through the refrigerator.













'This is your chance!' His companion's voice rang out through his mind.













'Now? Dudley is right there!' 













 'No. Take something when he leaves and let the pig take the blame.' 













Hari could feel him slinking around, as if preparing to strike out. He was sluggish though, in his voice and the mental impressions that Hari imagined as movements, and it worried Hari. He swore he would never make his Companion do that again. He would try harder, do better. For him.













When Dudley left, taking half the supply of Petunia's rice puddings, Hari made his move. He shot out like a snake and shoved his fingers between the door before it could close, ignoring the pain that blossomed at his fingertips. He cracked open the door and slipped his arm inside, pawing for the pudding cups. His fingers grazed the foil covering and he snatched it, pulling his arm back and gently shut the door, careful not to make too much noise.













He felt nothing but freedom rushing back to his cupboard, ripping the tinfoil off of his prize. He made sure to whisper Straiga to seal his door in between cherished bites of food from his fingers. He felt nothing but elation at his newfound trick, and praised his companion, who was silent the rest of the night. Hari left a bit of his treat for the Huntsman spiders that kept him company, shoving the cheap, plastic cup in the furthest webbed corner before curling on his dishrag and falling asleep.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

He had been caught. He had tried his trick of stealing food again, only Vernon had come home early. He had walked in on Hari nicking a can of soup from the pantry. He had wrenched the can away from Hari and the next thing he knew was a sharp, exploding pain across his temple. He had been knocked to the floor, with it pressed up against his cheek as he felt liquid drip down over his brow. His relief was small, only as long as it took Vernon to fall to his knees and bring his arm above his own head for another strike. All Hari knew afterwards were the bruising strikes against him, more often than not leaving small slices along his body. It seemed to last hours each time he was hit, and seconds between each respite, until the can burst against his body and he was coated in nearly-expired tomato soup.













""Clean it up, fucking sand nigger,"" He hissed.













Tears leaked out of Hari's eyes, and he allowed himself small, noisy sniffs before pushing himself up on his left side, careful of the stinging cuts littering his right. He didn't know what those words meant, but he knew Vernon called him that a lot.













'Everything hurts,' he cried, even inside his head.













'If I could, I would kill him,' Companion promised.













 'That's not nice,' he reprimanded softly, even as black fireworks exploded behind his eyes when he put any weight on his right sight. He winced back onto his left side, using his dominant hand to lean on and pick up the abandoned can with the other.














'And look at what they've done to you! Filthy muggles.' 














Hari ignored the ranting of his companion, and the numerous ways that his companion promised their deaths. He couldn't comprehend most of them anyway. Instead, he grit his teeth and heaved himself off of the floor using the cabinets as leverage. He limped to the trash bin and dropped the soup tin inside. He shut the cabinet door that held the bin and fetched a rag from the drawers. He wet it and began his trek back to his mess.













His companion was silent by the time Hari began scrubbing the floor. Instead of words, Hari felt a magic different than his own (the sparingly few times he had used it) flow through his body. It felt dark; like boiling blood. It coiled around his right side and he could feel it stinging as it weaved between his muscles and bones. 













It was odd and unpleasant and he hated it, but he trusted his companion. He could feel the right side of his ribcage constricting, shortening his breath and increasing his heart rate. He had stopped scrubbing the mess and was bracing himself in the puddle. It was of no use when the full force hit.













After the magic had braided through his body, the stinging began to increase until it felt like his entire right side was on pins and needles. Then everything seemed to explode. Hari couldn't even scream as it felt like half of him was being burned alive from the inside. He collapsed in the puddle on the brink of forced consciousness, his mind filled with static and random thoughts he knew weren't his own.














'Muggles. Magic. Hogwarts. Safety.'














Knowledge from his companion had blended with his own. He knew more, felt more, saw more, was more. He rose into a kneeling position on the floor, distantly fascinated that he was no longer in pain. He flexed his right hand, which felt static-like and strangely still, but proper.













He scrubbed the rest of the mess absently, venturing back and forth from the sink to the puddle on shaky legs. He noticed the mess had gotten noticeably bigger and more diluted. He decidedly did not think about how that came to be, And set about finishing his chore.













Once the mess was gone, he limped to the laundry room and dropped the dirty rag inside the sink there. He knew he would be expected to be in his cupboard, so that was his next destination.













    'What is Hogwarts?' Hari asked, even though he felt parts of him already knew.













'It's a school. Away from Muggles.' Companion sniffed as if Hari should know this already, as if he expected him to know it. It was ignored by both parties how exhausted he sounded.














'What even is a Muggle?'














His companion shifted slowly in his mind. Hari could feel his magic pressing on different places in his mind as he almost seemed to pace, or shrug.













'It is what they are. Useless. Magicless. Less in everything. Stupid.' But even he sounded somewhat unsure of himself, as if repeating something he had heard.













Hari didn't seem very sure of that explanation. After all--Ms. Petunia had gone to college and she always told him that he'd never be able to go. Mr. Vernon had a very nice job, and always told him that he'd be lucky if the Dursleys kept him around after he turned 18. And Dudley went to school! A lot of kids that looked the size Hari was went to school, and Hari himself didn't, so he must not be very smart.













Hari suddenly felt very self conscious. He had thought because he knew how to do things that Dudley couldn't do that he must have been terribly smart. He hadn't considered that Dudley knew how to do things that Hari didn't...













    He rubbed his arms and winced at the muted pain that ran through where he touched. He scoot over to the cracks in the door and held his arm up to the light. There were faint, purpling marks mottling his skin. He knew from experience that they would only get darker and icky looking, and take longer to heal.














'Why aren't the purples gone?'














'I fear if I healed your bruises the great oaf would beat you more.' His companion sounded apologetic. Hari didn't know why, he wasn't the one who hurt Hari.













Either way, Hari curled up onto his dishrag that currently served as a mattress, and tried to go to sleep.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

His dream was strange.....almost not like a dream at all. He was in darkness, aware, and for a moment he thought that he was having the song dream again. But instead of the motherly humming he expected, there was soft laughter that was definitely male.













Laughter that sounded vaguely familiar in his fogged mind. Laughter that became very familiar when he felt what was like thick, silk smoke brush up against his body and wrap around him.













'Hari...' He whispered, and Hari could have cried. It was the closest thing he'd ever had to a hug.













'I'm here,' he called out desperately, afraid Companion wouldn't be able to hear him. In return, he was completely enveloped in the smoke. It was suffocatingly thick, but Hari knew he would be okay. Companion would never hurt him.














'How are you in my dream?'














The smoke seemed to vibrate with the rich laughter that returned.














'It is not a dream, Hari, we are inside your mind. I am here because you have allowed us to merge.'














'Why do you keep calling me that?' Hari asked. He didn't know his own name, he was always one of those words that the Dursleys called him.














'Calling you what?'















'Hari.'














The smoke stilled for a moment, soft brushes against his skin that Hari imagined should feel like when Ms. Petunia held Dudley.














'Hari is your name.'














Hari fell back on what he thought served as the floor. It looked just as dark as the rest of the place, and for a moment he was scared he'd fall through. His companion began squeezing him reassuringly. Never long enough to hurt, just varying enough to comfort the small boy.














'My name? Harry?'















'No. Hari. It's Indian, like your father.'














'My father was a no-good, unemployed raghead who knocked up my mother and forced her to marry him.' Hari recited. It was what he was taught every time he asked. And every time he didn't, really.













'Do not say those words,' Companion's smoke became thinner than high-mountain air. Hari could imagine needle-sharp spines rippling from his edges. 'Those are ugly words. Ugly words for ugly people. Just like a Muggle to use them.'













'Why does he use them then?' Hari interrupted Companion's rather long-winded tirade about the 'contamination of Muggles'. He sucked in happy, heavy breaths when his companion's smoke thickened again as he calmed.













'He thinks himself superior because of his skin. A rather stupid ideology if you ask me, since most of what he is lounging in and about was created by his dreaded foreigners.' His last words sounded like when Petunia talked to Hari; dull and as if he thought the words themselves were rather stupid. His smoke was still agitated, but not so much as before.













'So he uses those words like you use Muggle?' Hari asked. It seemed like a valid comparison--his companion's tone sounded just like Vernon's when he used those words.













His companion grew very still, as if contemplating. He began various audacious sentences that started with things such as 'Well,' 'I--','No,' 'You're only a child so,' but finally settled with an answer after a few sullen minutes.













'Yes. I suppose he does, and I suppose I do.' And then he was quiet for very long moments. They decided to share the silence together. Until Hari had more questions.














'You said you're here 'cause we merged?'















'Yes.' 















'What does that mean?'















'Your magic allowed me to.....use my magic in your body. Our magics are not compatible, which is why the process is not easy and, regrettably, painful. Over time our magics should become more similar and this should cease to be a problem. I could access my magic at will, and perhaps, so could you.'















'So your colour will become green instead of red?'














'My magic is--red?' This seemed to surprise his companion, as he was silent for several moments even with mental proddings from Hari.














'Yes--is that bad?'














'No. Simply.....interesting. It use to be black.'  The smoke hummed around him and seemed to glow, then it seemed to erupt in reverse as if trying to look at itself. Sure enough, under the rusted-dust colour of his companion were bright, lightning-like streaks of deep red that crackled noiselessly through him.














'How fascinating...'














Hari felt what he could only describe as a snake tongue flicking out around and through the cloud. This greatly confused him, but it gave him an image that made him laugh.













He imagined his companion as a great big snake--brown and green all over with a black belly. Oh how badly it would scare Ms. Petunia!













As soon as he thought it and began to giggle, he noticed that the smoke was lessening. It seemed to be disappearing into nowhere, and Hari felt himself become very scared.













Before his eyes a great snake began to appear on the--floor?--in front of his feet. It didn't look like how he imagined it, per se; more like the snakes he stole glimpses of on the telly in South America that hissed about how ugly the camera people were. But instead of shades of brown and greens, this snake was deep reds and shadowy blacks. It did have a black belly, so Hari had to give it some credit.













'Um, hello,'  greeted Hari. He was admittedly scared without his companion, but the snakes in the garden seemed nice enough so maybe this one was too?













The snake seemed amazed. It's grey-blue eyes were nearly twice the size they were supposed to be, open in shock. It gave an experimental wiggle and shot out its tongue a few times. Then, it hissed in absolute pleasure.














'I haven't had a body in years.'














Hari was bewildered by the voice that emanated from the snake. It sounded just like--














'You're my companion!?'














'Your companion? Now where did you learn a word like that?' The snake seemed to laugh at him, if the short, syllabic hisses were anything to go by.













Hari suddenly seemed very shy of himself.













'The telly...' he tried.













The snake seemed to relent and slithered up to him. It took a few moments before it was able to figure out how to 'stand' alongside Hari and drape itself across his shoulders.













'I am indeed your.....companion,' It--he seemed amused by Hari, so greatly so that he gave a small jerk of his body as he laughed and flicked his tongue against the boy's face.













'Well that--that's good then. It's good then.' Hari paused for a moment. 'You said you didn't have a body before, but you do now, why?'













'I am because you wish it. Your magic allowed me to form. You wished it, and so it happened, as I am a part of you now.' He thought for a bit before continuing, 'If your magic had tried to force me into a body that was incompatible, it would have been painful for the both of us. In a sense, I am because you wish it and because it can be.'













'So.....if I had tried to make you something else it wouldn't have worked?'  It was hard to form the questions he was trying to ask, but he knew imagining his companion as anything other than a snake seemed wrong.














'Most likely, yes. In our world, Magia are able to shift into our animal counterparts, known as our Animagus. It is a combination name of Animal and Magia, as we are our animal selves, yet we keep our minds and for some, our abilities. A snake was my chosen Animagi, therefore we were extremely fortunate.'















'Mageea?'















'Magia. It is the collective term for witches, wizards, and other sorts of sorcerers. Magic people.'














'And they can all turn into animals?' Hari became very excited; if he could turn into an animal maybe he could get more food!














'No. It takes dedicated Magia with a strong magical core. It takes many years to become one, after the years of finding out if you even can. One must have the basics of several magical subjects, at the very least.














Hari felt his hope deflate and pop like a balloon Dudley had discarded. He dared himself to pick up the pieces and ask one more question:














'Would you teach me?'














The snake around his shoulders coiled around him and curled to face him directly.














'Teach you what?'















'Everything.'














The snake gave a hissing laugh and nodded. Hari yawned into his hand and smiled at him. His companion was the last thing he saw before he drifted off into unconsciousness.

The whole ""dreaded foreigners"" thing is supposed to be sarcastic, and that's how I imagine the description of sarcasm.

Cross Your Fingers


(Or rather, Broken Promises)


Hari's companion held true to his word. He did, in a sense, attempt to teach Hari everything.

Companion had been teaching Hari many things other than magic. He had taught Hari how to tell time on the clock in the living room, how to count and do basic math, and even read. 

Reading was something Hari treasured almost as much as magic. He had been working on merging; his and companion's magic (which was now a very deep marooning purple that continued to fascinate him) and Companion could show him books. He could only show a few pages at a time with the rate that Hari read, as keeping up such a complex image tired him out quicker. 









Though the merging process was having a reverse effect, according to Companion, it seemed to be more desirable as his energy levels raised faster. His mental snake body grew bigger as he grew stronger, and he could keep up more complicated images (like books for Hari) in Hari's mind's eye. 









He had also taught Hari something very important besides the bare essential educations. So personal, and so very happy, that Hari had believed someone like himself wasn't allowed to have. 









Companion had taught Hari his birthday. 









It was currently December of 1985, but Hari's birthday was in July. He had turned five years old, celebrated in his cupboard with the spiders and his companion, who decided to give Hari the gift of books. 









It was the kindest thing Companion had ever done for him--it was the kindest thing anyone had done for him--and because of it, Hari treasured reading almost as much as he treasured magic (after all, if he didn't have magic then he wouldn't have his companion). 









Besides his lessons, they had been practicing magic for months now. Hari could make things float and duplicate items long enough to ward off suspicion of him stealing them. He had learned to wait until the dead of night to steal food now, and never risked it in the morning. 









He still ravaged the scraps of Dudley's food that Petunia would pass on to him after he had left for school; it usually consisted of mushy, dissolving cereal in milk that Hari was half sure Dudley spit in just for the heck of it, or the burnt or undercooked pieces of eggs and bacon they would feed him in the hopes he would get sick. It made him want to vomit, but he knew he couldn't stay alive with his night-nicking. He couldn't hoard food without being caught. He had tried, and the result was being beaten so badly he passed out. 









His companion had refused to heal him. Rather, he had walked Hari through the process of stopping internal bleeding and repairing organs Hari didn't know the name of, but did take away pain when Hari healed the bones himself. Since then, Hari had not tried to hoard food, and only snuck out when he was so hungry he felt nauseated. 









Food was his lifeline, but magic was his salvation. He could purify the contents in his stomach, repair and thicken his rag and clothes, and stave off dehydration and starvation for far longer than he suspected would of killed other children. He thanked whatever was out there constantly for giving him magic, much to his companion's approval. 









He would be locked in the cupboard all day today, since the baby was coming. It was his fault, after all. Petunia had been so worked up learning that he had been stealing her food that all of the sudden there was a massive wet spot on the carpet under her legs as she was screaming at him. 









She had braced herself against the archway across from the cupboard, screaming at Vernon and cursing the day Hari was born. She had glared at Hari and threatened that if anything happened to their baby that she would kill him. Hari believed her. 









And so he sat in his cupboard hugging his too-small knees to his chest, rocking back and force, crying silently. 









His companion tried to soothe him, telling him to 'slip back into your mind,' whatever that meant, but Hari just brushed him off and imagined that he had killed someone and it was all his fault. He cried harder thinking about an innocent baby that could have grown up to love him, just maybe. 









He sat that way for hours, not allowing himself the release of sleep. He wanted to punish himself--he deserved it.  He could hear the dying roar of the engine pulling into the garage. It was either his saving grace or the warrant of his death. 









He heard the thundering steps of Dudley, squalling because he didn't want a sister! Hari felt tears run down his face that he thought had long dried out. He was saved! For today, at the very least. 









He listened fervently for any information he could, pressing his face against the door of his room. He could feel the unfinished wood digging into the skin of his face, most likely leaving splinters, but he didn't care. All that mattered to him was that Eunice Nicole Dursley was born on December eighteenth and she was okay. 









Dudley was complaining about his mother being in the hospital with Eunice this close to Christmas and Vernon was trying to soothe him with promises of more presents. Hari had use to pretend that maybe he would get a Christmas present if he was extra, extra good, and today he thought that maybe, just maybe, Eunice was his Christmas present. 









Apparently Petunia wouldn't be able to come home until the end of the week as the doctors wanted to make sure she and the baby were okay. Hari was very cautious taking this in. It could be very good, or very bad spending a whole week with a Ms. Figg. 









Vernon would be taking Dudley and staying in the King's Ivory Hotel, one of the many that Vernon's company apparently owned. He was pacifying his son with promises of endless movies and something called room service while Hari switched between daydreaming and a day-mare of what a Ms. Figg would be like. 









He had heard from the gossip circles that qualified as Ms. Petunia's Book Club on Wednesday, Companion taught him, that Ms. Figg bred very ugly cats for very high prices. She was one of the only non-white people who dared to live in Privet Drive, and the only one in general who took up such an odd pastime of breeding half-pure animals and trying to sell them. 









    Hari had seen one of these cats before, on the rare occasion he use to be let outside. One of them had been sitting on the cornerstone of the fence while he had been precariously weeding the garden. It had a squished face with ears longer than its head, and wide, round eyes that stared at him. It was covered in bright orange fur that seemed too long for its small body and gathered at its ears, chin, and long, fat tail. 









Hari didn't think it was ugly. On the contrary, he thought it was fascinating. The way that the golden eyes followed his movements and the fluffy tail swished back and forth--even the way it opened its smushed mouth to yawn and yowl at him. When Hari's green eyes met golden ones, he felt familiarity, as if he knew this animal. 









It didn't last long. 









Ms. Petunia had gone outside to check on Hari and spotted the creature, screeching words that Hari's companion called obscenities. She had thrown gardening tools at the poor animal before digging her nails into his arm and wrenching him back inside. It was the last time he had ever been allowed outside the house in what he now knew to be six months. 









Ms. Petunia had made a riot of it the next Book Club meeting, garnering all sorts of sympathy from her upper-suburban companions. They had all screeched at how they should make a petition to kick out Ms. Figg, and perhaps the others like her. 









While he detested any sort of Ms. Petunia's friends, he couldn't help but wonder what a Ms. Figg might be like, since the other Ms. Petunias seemed to frown down upon her so very much. 









He would get his answer very soon, he learned, as he was dragged out of his cupboard the next day. Vernon had forced him into some better looking clothes Dudley had grown too big for and made sure no bruises were visible before sending him with a bag to walk himself down the street. 









He was barely told the number (Number Eight of Wisteria Walk) before he was nearly hit by Mr. Dursley pulling out of the driveway 









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









Ms. Figg was an odd sort of woman, Hari decided. She was dark skinned and still had dark hair despite her old age, and her r's rolled together like music when she spoke. She had introduced herself as Ms. Arabella Figgueroa, but had laughed off his horrible, mangled mispronunciation and told him that he should call her Ms. Figg. 









Ms. Figg did indeed own many cats. She had two males; named Mr. Tibbles and Mr. Paws, and two females; Snowy and Tufty. Hari didn't understand why his companion found this so funny. 









Tufty had just had a litter of seven kittens, apparently fathered by the silver-coloured Mr. Paws. Snowy was currently pregnant by Mr. Tibbles, and Ms. Figg was hoping she had at least six. 









They all looked rather strange--much like Mr. Tibbles (the cat Hari later learned had been peeping on him). All having mostly normal squashed, cat-like features, but some sort of aura that was strange about them. Hari decided cats were okay, but he may not much like them. 









Ms. Figg's house was decorated in bright tiles and tightly hand-woven rugs she claimed had been passed down from her ancestors. She had immediately sat Hari down on the green couch sporting a heavily pregnant, non-much-too friendly Snowy, and whipped him up just a cuppa dear! 









'Just a cuppa' ended up being two kettles full--as many as Ms. Figg could stuff down Hari before he implored she stopped before his tummy burst. Ms. Figg decided to move on to biscuits next. 









She introduced Hari to her favourite shows on the telly, which Hari cautiously watched with her. Her favourites seemed to be hopeless romantic soap operas that had Companion begging for Hari to murder him, or dating games that had Companion offering to murder her. 









She also introduced Hari to needlepoint, knitting, and crocheting. Hari's small, nimble fingers made easy work of the yarn, but he couldn't admit to not seeing the point or to forgetting which way was a pearl and which way was a stitch, or which way to properly tie a knot of thread (which Hari found rather silly). 









It was three days into his visit that Hari committed an act of nonsense. 









He had tripped over a lump in one of Ms. Figg's decorative rugs and dropped a porcelain teacup. In his panic to avoid punishment, he hissed a small "":Repairo:,"" and watched the cup tumble back together. He watched the cup tumble back together two seconds too-late after noticing Ms. Figg in the doorway of the kitchen. 









Tears began to pool in scared eyes as he begged over and over not to let the Dursleys know, that he would take anything, any sort of punishment Ms. Figg wanted to give him. He promised her that she could hit him as much as she liked, he wouldn't tell, just as long as she kept his secret. 









How very shocking it was for Hari when at the end of his whispered pleadings Ms. Figg's dark eyes mirrored his own. Hari could see the years of her age physically pile up on her as she gazed at him, silent streaks running down from her eyes past the neckline of her blouse. She did nothing to stop them. 









She dropped to her knees with a great crack! against the spanish tile in her house, so quickly and so hard that Hari feared her knees had snapped. She began apologizing to him, of all people, begging for his forgiveness for not seeing the signs, for not doing something earlier. 









She outstretched her arms to him and Hari feared he would be punished, before chilling maroon magic pushed hundreds upon hundreds of memories into his head. Memories of himself being held in almost such a way by a redheaded woman and a man who looked like him, of being in a warm tummy with hands caressing outside him whispering words of endearments, of being kissed on the head by the humming woman from his dreams who cried and whispered Goodbye.  









He flung himself into her arms and allowed himself to be hugged for the first time in a long time, with hushed promises of safety and a better life and someone named Dumbledore coming to fix it over the top of his head. 









Hari decided he would miss Ms. Figg rather terribly at the end of the week. And he did. 









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









When Hari first met Eunice he was completely mesmerized. She had soft brown tufts on her too-small looking head and big blue eyes that would shine when she saw him. Hari fell in love instantly. He wanted her as his sister. He would protect her, and care for her, and love her, unlike Dudley. And strangely.....Ms. Petunia.













After being brought home from the hospital, Petunia wanted nothing to do with the small child. Petunia wouldn't hold her, barely fed her, and screamed incessantly when Eunice cried. 













And so, like many more things, the task of caring for Eunice fell to Hari. Hari couldn't help but feel excited. He would cradle her when she was fussy, and hum the song from his dreams, and read to her the books his companion shared, and even make bright spots of light out of nothing to make her giggle when she became especially upset. He became the one designated to feed her, change her, clothe her, bathe her, and put her to sleep. 













Dudley couldn't do it, for he was only a boy. 













Vernon couldn't do it, since that was women's work. 













Petunia couldn't do it, since she refused to hardly look in the child's direction, let alone care for her. 













So Hari became her big brother. And Hari loved it, and Hari loved her, and Hari was loved by her. 













Hari was the one who taught her to smile, to roll over along the floor (when Petunia would allow it), and to begin babbling. He was also the one who began to hush her cries when Ms. Petunia was screaming, or when Eunice witnessed Vernon or Dudley punishing him, soothing her with quite instructions of ""you need to cry quietly, please, Eunice, please!"" 













And it was so that when Ms. Petunia decided to take Eunice away from him, Hari decided to say no. 













No. She didn't get to abandon Eunice for months on end, hating her very existence for not being back inside her belly, and then claim her back, simply because she hated Hari. No. She didn't get to pretend to love Eunice, only to leave her squalling at night, starving, like she had the weeks before she was assigned to Hari. No. She simply didn't get to decide to give Hari the most precious thing he had had in his life and then rip it away from him. 













When Ms. Petunia's decision was announced, Hari rebelled. He rebelled for the first time in his small life, for the most precious thing he currently had. 













He reached out to the roots of his magic and felt for the darkest, hottest parts of it. The parts that could burn you alive or freeze you to death. Glass had rattled and exploded, leaving Ms. Petunia's fine china in teeny tiny shards across the floor. Wood furniture cracked, granite broke, the wind practically screamed. 













When Mr. Dursley had reached out for him by his hair, his arm was twisted back in the wrong direction. Sickening popping noises teased their way through the room over the howling of the gathering storm outside as Vernon's arm continued to warp past its limit, drawing high pitched shrieks from all Hari's audience. 













He was prepared to continue, to rip it off; if he had too, until Petunia gained a calm look on her face and placed her hand over Eunice's face. 

















The wind hushed. 

















The furniture halted. 

















Hari didn't even breathe. 

















""Fix it, or you'll be responsible for what happens next."" Ms. Petunia said, her bony fingers curling around the babe's delicate neck. 

















Vernon's arm was forcibly ripped back into place. 

















China repaired itself faster than it had broken. 

















Hari counted all the ways he could think of to kill himself. 

















Petunia uncurled her hands from around the baby and set her on the table, seemingly oblivious to Eunice's terrified cries. Hari felt a gut wrenching guilt he had caused such a reaction from her. He had only wanted to protect her, and instead had terrified her. 

















""You will no longer have direct contact with my child until she can learn how to put you in your place. You have lost the privileges of breakfast, and your meals are to be held whenever we see fit."" 

















Hari sucked in a small breath. This meant no more guaranteed food. Which meant more necessary stealing. Which meant more risks of getting caught. 

















He nodded submissively, refusing the tears that wanted to fall past his eyelashes and leave hot trails down his cheeks. 

















Hari had loved, had been loved, and now Hari had lost.

Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air


(Or rather, an Introduction to the Elements)


When July came around, and Hari turned six, Companion bestowed a new gift upon him. Companion taught him how to change things. Hari could now transfigure useless objects he learned to hoard into books. Obviously he didn't need to hoard more than one or two things, as he could change them back and forth as he pleased (or rather, when there was danger of him being discovered), but Hari liked to pretend that each item was its own book. 

The piece of tinfoil from his first rice pudding cup was a Potion's theory book, written in strange squiggles that Hari could read just as easy as english. The broken soldier man Dudley had thrown at him (accusing Hari of breaking it) was a book of magical history. Strips of an old, unusable, extra-ratty dishrag became Transfiguration for Beginners, Introduction to Alchemy, and Alchemy vs. Transfiguration. 

He couldn't practice, let alone begin to imagine successfully attempting most of the theories and spells in his books. Most of them made no sense, and his Companion had to slither about and explain them in easier contexts. 

    Much like both his knowledge and his collection, Hari's companion had been growing too. 

What had started out as a great snake nearly the length of Hari in dark red, was now over twice that length in shades of deep purple, borderline indigo. His eyes remained the same grey-blue from their first meeting, yet his personality had shifted just as much as his magic. 

Instead of biting sarcasm or offended rants, Companion tended to attempt to explain the theories, their purposes, and in what ways they could possibly be necessary. Instead of long-winded (and mostly terrifying) tirades about how he would be most enjoyed to murder Hari's relatives, and exactly how it would go about, there were mainly hushed, hissed words of comfort while Hari was being beaten, a blanket of what felt like heavy river water covering his being. 

Make no mistake that there still were rants and tirades of all sorts, and that his companion could pout like nobody's business (though Hari tried to keep that thought to himself). But Companion was trying, and that was what mattered most to Hari.


'Hari...' Hari felt pressure against the front of his head, much like how Ms. Figg's cats butt their heads against everything. 

'Speaking of the devil.' Hari teased. He knew that his companion enjoyed nicknames like this. 

'You're getting weaker.' He hissed. 

Hari had foregone the idea of magically duplicating food that would disappear hours later, after almost getting caught twice. 

The first time Hari had nearly been caught, it was only by Dudley. Hari hadn't worried much since the worst the Dursleys would do was to give Dudley a light punishment for imagining things and then punish Hari for the possibility of it being true. But Dudley didn't notice when one of his seven fruit cups had suddenly disappeared. He seemed a bit confused as he reached for more and there was none, but shrugged it off and merely went back to the fridge. 

So Hari continued. 

Then Mr. Vernon nearly caught him. He had been pilfering Ms. Petunia's baking graham crackers when suddenly one of the packages was open and half missing. Once that Vernon was sure he hadn't touched it yet, Vernon came to the conclusion that Hari must have nicked some food while Vernon hadn't been looking. 

Hari had been cleaning the floors of the kitchen while Vernon was watching some sort of sport on the telly when suddenly he was ripped up by his hair and shoved into the bucket of dirty water. He struggled and fought, his small arms pushing against the flimsy plastic sides of the bucket as sweet, acidic liquid made its way up his nose and down his throat. 

He thought that he would die there. For a moment he didn't mind as his vision spotted and his lungs seemed to burn. Then he was let up and all he could do was cough and wheeze, alternating between asphyxiating on the water spilling from his mouth and gulping down air. 

It didn't last long. 

The sponge he was using to clean was shoved in his mouth, the sharp chemical-filled water leaving stinging trails down his chin and neck. When Hari finally choked down the water from the sponge, swallowing the bits that his teeth ripped off, it was torn from his mouth.  

When he was thrown onto the floor he braced himself against the floor, expelling rust coloured water from his stomach. His arms were shaking and his face was covered in vomit and tears leaked from his face. Hari thought it was over. 

He was wrong. 

He was once again pulled up by his hair, flung backwards onto his back. He watched Vernon lumber over him, his sleeves rolled up and his face purpling. His arms were soaked and his eyes glint when he forced the brown sponge back into Hari's mouth. 

Hari tried to keep his mouth closed, holding his breath, until Vernon forced Hari's head back and squeezed the chemical-filled liquid into his nose. Violent, choking coughs wracked the small boy as Vernon forced the cleaning product back in Hari's mouth. 

Over and over again He was forced to swallow the mop water, until the bucket was nearing empty and he was simply strewn to-and-fro in his own sick due to the amount.  

He was saved by the least likely source--Ms. Petunia. Petunia had come in, holding an irate Eunice in what seemed be a too-tight tutu dress. She took one look at Vernon over Hari and shrieked.  

""What are you doing to the floors, Vernon! We're having guests!"" 

She had been more concerned over the repulsive smell emanating from the Kitchen and whether or not it would stain rather than the potential body count her floor would soon gain. 

So Hari had been left alone in his mess, instructed to clean it up before the guests arrived in an hour. 

He had barely accomplished it, vomiting more than he was cleaning. On shaky arms and numb legs he finished his task, before passing out outside his cupboard. 

He had been punished again later when Petunia had to stall so Vernon could shove him in. 

Since then, Hari had not tried to duplicate food. Instead, he took to digging through scraps. He would pick off pieces of food left in pots and pans before he cleaned them, or after he was done cooking, dig through the garbage a few hours after meals when he learned it was safe, and even leave out food to spoil a bit to be thrown out. 

He had not yet been discovered, and was becoming better with persuasion magic to make sure he wouldn't be. 

He couldn't force someone to stay in a room, or make decisions they wouldn't normally, or choose actions that went against their personality; but he could cause distractions. A wondering about favourite tv shows on, even if they knew it wouldn't be, a push in the direction of needing to use the restroom, buying Hari a bit of time, or even something as simple as yawning or stretching to warn if how close someone was. 

'You haven't eaten in days.' 

Hari was currently being punished for burning just too much of Vernon's eggs. Petunia had decided that Hari's punishment would be to stay locked in his cupboard for an indeterminable amount of time. 

He hadn't been let out to clean, eat, or use the restroom  

It had been almost a week and Hari was feeling nauseous. He was too fearful of sneaking out since Eunice cried all hours of the night and kept up Ms. Petunia, but his chance was coming. It was Sunday and the Dursleys would be leaving. 

He waited until he could no longer hear the roar of the engine in the driveway and slid his fingers along the crack of his door. 

"":Alohomora:,"" He hissed. 

He slowly creaked open the door, peering out every direction before stepping out. He slipped quickly into the kitchen, his tiny feet echoing sharp slaps against the wood and tile in the house. 

On the island counter there was a large, cooling casserole. His mouth watered at the sight of it. Though his burnt food usually tasted better than what Petunia whipped up, Hari was so hungry. 

'Use an expansion charm. Then force it to stay.' His companion whispered. 

Hari felt confused. 'What?' 

'Take a small slice, or a few. Then expand the dish to cover the gaps.' 

'Why didn't you teach me this earlier!?' Hari was upset. If he had known how to make food stay then he wouldn't have been punished. He forced himself to calm down--Companion must have a reason.  

'The food is tasteless and will eventually vanish. When impacted it begins to dissolve. They would have noticed when they couldn't actually eat or their food wouldn't crunch beneath their teeth. If you had expanded your own food, it would have shrunk in your stomach.' 

So he would have been punished anyway.....or would of starved to death. 

Hari took slivers along the ends of the dish, muttering Crescere to fill the gaps. 

'How do I make it stay?' 


'Lignum. It's a temporary sticking charm. Only focus on making the expansion charm stay, else the entire dish will stick to its container.'


Hari felt a bit silly as he pictured a whole casserole without the dish, but he did as told. He always would for Companion. 

The few badly cooked slices of casserole sitting in Hari's cupped hands felt like a feast to him. He savored the feeling of food in his mouth rather than the taste, taking small nibbles and holding his breath when he held it in his mouth. 

When he was finished he licked the remnants off of his hands, surprisingly without any comments of how revolting it was to lick his hands from Companion.  

He began making his way back to the cupboard when he was stopped by soft scales pressing against his mind. 

'You should be enjoying yourself.' 

'I did. I ate.' 

'You used to like the outdoors, why not venture outside?' His companion offered. 

Hari thought about it. It had been a while.....It had been a long while. He missed the feeling of the sun on his face, the grass against his skin, the earth between his toes, the taste of the wind. Even the replicated memories he ventured to as Companion taught him could hardly mimic the real thing. 

'I believe I will.' Hari offered back. 

He decided to go out the side door of the garage, careful that no one had seen him. When the Dursleys caught whispers of a strange brown boy in the neighborhood, Hari had been left with what Companion called a concussion and refused to let Hari sleep that night. He had been lectured about being more careful in between the pummelings of fists, making sure that no one knew it was the Dursleys who housed such a freak.


He walked around the neighborhood, taking note of which houses held familiar cars he often saw leaving after Petunia's book club, and which ones looked very similar to the one Mr. Vernon drove to work. He walked all the way through Privet Drive and came to a little corner sign that pointed in three directions. The left was Wisteria Walk, the middle course continued Privet Drive, and the right led to Manzanita Trace. 

Hari wanted to go visit Ms. Figg. He hadn't seen her in a while and the pavement was starting to blister his feet. He made a left and began walking to Number Eight. 

It was a pretty light-grey brick one story house with dark shingling and white windows and doors. He could see the cream coloured curtains pulled in front of the shutters and imagined Ms. Figg sitting in her green armchair while her kittens took up the sofa. He liked to think perhaps she was making tea, or reading one of her romance novels she forbade him from touching. 

He gently rapped on the white door and waited a few moments. He expected to see a Ms. Figg with a book in her hand, or perhaps a teacup, or even one or several of her odd cats to prevent them from escaping. 

What he did not expect was to see a worn out, disheveled looking Ms. Figg covered in soot and ash. Her hair was in a disarrayed bun, grey streaks more prominent than ever. Dark purple-black bags hung under her usually brilliant brown eyes that seemed to have lost their warmth, rimmed a bright red that led water stains down her face. Once she realized who was at the door she gave Hari a bright smile, but Hari couldn't help but compare how dull it seemed with the ones she had given him before. 

""Hari! Oh, Hari dear. Oh--darling--please come in!""  

She ushered him inside with feather-soft touches against his shoulders, something he was very grateful for, and dabbed at her eyes with the edge of her blouse. It smeared soot around her face, but Hari thought it would be rather rude to point that out. 

She led him to the couch and shooed off a rather affectionate Mr. Tibbles, who seemed to butt at Hari persistently. 

""Hari, dear, I'm so sorry,"" she began to cry, running the tracks of her face wet again. ""I--I tried to explain to them, to the Ministry and to Dumbledore, but they simply wouldn't listen. I've been trying dear, I promise."" 

She seemed quite upset about something Hari couldn't completely grasp. Hari did the only thing he knew how in order to comfort her--he hugged her. He crawled up onto her lap and stretched his thin arms around her round, soft body and buried his face in her shoulder. 

In return she wrapped her long arms around him and cried into the tameless curls of his hair. 

""It's alright..."" he said slowly. He never spoke unless he was hissing out spells, and his voice was rough from disuse. ""You did everything you could."" 

""I--I offered to take you, I could teach you, but they--they said--they said that you're safer with your aunt and uncle!"" 

She gave a hysterical laugh and Hari froze. 

""My aunt and uncle?"" 

She sniffled lightly and pulled back from him. Hari looked up at her, curious and open and so scared; that her body jerked along with her sobs. Ms. Figg forced composure upon herself. 









""They never--they never told you?"" 









Hari shook his head. Ms. Figg took shaky, deep breaths and began to explain. 









""Petunia and Vernon are your aunt and uncle. Dudley and the baby are your cousins. Petunia was Lily's, your mother, sister. When she and your father, James, died you were transferred to their guardianship."" Her voice soured at the end, similar to the face she made when she over-boiled tea.  






Lily and James. Hari finally had something to hold on to. He had asked his companion several times about his parents, but Companion always went quiet and still and wouldn't speak for the rest of the day. Lily and James. Names to the faces he treasured that his companion had pushed forward that one day, to the voices that told Hari they loved him.










Ms. Figg seemed to hesitate before steeling herself. 





""They.....They're the reason you can do what you can do."" She gave him a very deliberate look and Hari drew his brows together. 









'Magic, small one,' Companion hissed. Hari was surprised--both because his companion never wanted to talk about Hari's parents and because his parents could do it too. 









Hari had always had an inkling--after all, with thoughts of Hogwarts running around in his head from his companion Hari knew he wasn't the only one like this. It was both comforting and isolating; he wasn't alone in ability, but he was alone here. And yet.....his parents could do it too... 









""Your mother was a brilliant witch. My son, Cristiano, use to complain about how she beat him out of Astrology and Arithmancy. They were his favourite subjects at Hogwarts. I believed he had quite the crush on her, many people did."" 









Ms. Figg adopted a sad smile, and stared at the fireplace with a look that Hari didn't like on her face. It was too sad, too painful, and it didn't belong on Ms. Figg's face, whom Hari believed only deserved happiness. 









""Hogwarts--that's a school, right?"" 









She didn't seem perturbed that he knew this, either convinced that he came to a conclusion based on her explanation or having heard of it previously (though where he would have besides Companion, Hari didn't know, and no one but Hari knew of his companion). 









""Yes. A school for magical children. There are many of them, I went to one myself when I was younger."" She seemed both happy and sad; a word that his companion called reminiscent. 









""Though I went to Castelobruxo instead of Hogwarts, I sent Cristiano there because of a deal with my husband."" 









She laughed to herself, though it was a hollow noise. Like the last remnants of an abandoned house lighting up. 









'Castel Broom shoes?' Hari crinkled his nose at the name. And he thought Hogwarts was weird. 









'No,' His companion laughed, 'Castelobruxo. It's in South America. Hidden in the rain forest.' Images of thick flora and exotic fauna filled his mind, large dewdrops gathered as big as Hari's fist in leaves larger than Hari's body. It was beautiful, Hari decided. 









""Your father was in Gryffindor."" Her voice was tight and drawn, echoed by the lines suddenly appearing on her face. ""Hogwarts has four houses, you see. Gryffindor is the house of the brave, and there was no better place for James Potter. He became an Auror after school, one of the best there was. He served under Alastor Moody, the best Auror this millennium has ever seen."" 









Hari latched on eagerly, tears beginning to well in his eyes. He had never heard such things about his parents--especially his father. He felt something for the first time: pride. 









""And my--my mother?"" 









Ms. Figg smiled gratefully at him, the way Hari imagined his mother would have smiled. 









""She was in Hufflepuff, the house of the hard-working and true. And oh did she earn her place!"" Ms. Figg laughed again, and it was a better sound than the one before. ""She made the best grades, and won four awards for the highest of the class at the end of her Seventh Year. She was learning how to become an Alchemist and a Potions Mistress.""










""I very much believe that if she had--if she had lived,"" Ms. Figg stumbled and dabbed at her eyes, starting once more. ""I very much believe that if she had lived, she would have become the most wonderful Potions Mistress the world has ever seen, at least for a very long time."" 









Hari began to cry, and Ms. Figg couldn't stop her sniffles that joined him. He had escaped early in the morning and the Dursleys always took till after lunch to return. It was nearing nine-o'clock, and Hari stayed at Ms. Figg's as long as he could. 









They spoke of many things in that time, yet Ms. Figg seemed hesitant to talk about Hari's father and placated him with tales of his mother. About how she was the brightest witch of her time and had a tendency to get carried away in letting everyone know. About how James was every teacher's worst nightmare from the minute he stepped off the train. About how Lily's best friends were Severus Snape, Alice Longbottom, and Marlene McKinnon, and how they rivaled his father's group of  and Frank Longbottom, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin, but seldom got caught when retaliating against the self-proclaimed ""Marauders"". 









And finally, before Hari left, they spoke of his parents' death. Of James' betrayal in order to try to save his wife, and how he was offering up his son in return for being spared. 









And suddenly, Hari wasn't so proud of his father anymore. 









Ms. Figg had once told him that sometimes good people made bad decisions to save the people they love. Hari didn't understand why James didn't love him, and asked her quite frankly that very question. Ms. Figg had gone very silent for a long while. And when she spoke, she spoke very quietly. 









""No matter what happened that night, it is not your fault."" 









She assured him that she believed quite furiously that both his parents loved him very much. 









Hari didn't believe her. He so desperately wanted to, but how could someone who supposed to love him leave him like that? 









When Hari had left it was another tearful goodbye.He had ran as fast as his legs would carry him back to Number Four of Privet Drive, hopelessly praying to whatever was out there that he would make it back before the Dursleys did. 









He scraped his callused hands scrambling over the garden wall and twisted his ankle when he fell into the rose bushes down below. Cuts of varying depths and sizes covered his body as he crawled out, forcing himself along the sticker-infested grass and into the doggy-door Vernon had had installed for his sister, Mrs. Nelson. 









He was very careful about rubbing up the blood with the rags that served as his shirt. He was deadly sure that he didn't dare leave a single streak of muck or blood. His feet burned and it was making Hari sweat with how much magic he had to use to prevent the blisters on them from bursting until he was safely inside his cupboard.  









Once inside he forced his magic to heal him, ignoring the screamed warnings inside his head that he needed words or he could cause more harm. He simply didn't have time. As he felt cuts sizzling closed and blisters reversing themselves, which was twice as painful as obtaining them, Hari's magic began to take its toll. He had never used so much at one time, especially not so much without structure. 









So Hari did the only thing he could do. Hari fainted. 









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









Hari was locked in his cupboard until Wednesday. He could tell by the growling of the other Ms. Petunia's cars that they had borrowed from their husbands and by the clicking of heels against wood accompanied by their wearers' high pitched chitter-chatter. 









He cast a silencing charm to surround the inside of the cupboard, mostly due to his companion's complaints. It became a nice time for a nap and Hari blacked out. 









He was deposited back into his mindscape; a place Hari still couldn't figure out how to purposely visit. He could even count the amount of times he had been to his mindscape on one hand and still have fingers left over. It still looked like it did the first time; much like a vast, empty void. 









His companion was in his snake form, as usual. Hari took in his long, thick body that had most definitely grown. The last time Hari had seen him, He was a deep purple that had began turning blue, and just over twice his original length and width with black eye-like patterns. 









Now, Companion was a grey sea-blue with wave like patterns that glittered black. He was as thick as both of Hari's arms and legs all put together and had grown at least an extra foot or two. 









'Hari...' his companion greeted. 









'Companion. You've been quiet lately.' Despite his usual rantings over Petunia's book club and the toned down death threats he offered every time they passed the Dursleys, Companion had been eerily silent since Sunday with Ms. Figg. 









Companion's tongue flicked out slowly, as if he was contemplating something. 









'Hari.....I need to speak with you.' His body curled in around itself, as if he was afraid. It was a strange thing to feel coming from his companion. 









'Well you'll have to explain what we're doing now if we aren't already speaking,' Hari teased. 









'It's about your father.' 









Hari froze. Companion never willingly spoke of the Potters. Even after Sunday he had been near completely silent, except for the expected tirades that sounded half-hearted even to Hari. 









'There are things you need to know, but I can only explain so many of them--I can only remember so many of them.' 









Hari felt Companion's need for Hari to understand. Reluctantly, Hari accepted the foreign magic and watched as the mindscape swirled like an animated Starry Night. 









The transparent floor began to grow grass, peeking out as if through a thick, ashy fog. Hari heard the sound of waves echoing through the expansion, completely entranced as a large lake began to take shape through the blackness.  









He could see that instead of a single pane of simply darkness, his void was made up of many layers. Dense, mud-consistent smoke packed together, one layer on top of the other, intermingling and thinning out to a soft, grey mist that became the colour of seafoam as the lake began to emerge. From the grass grew bricks, and the bricks piled together the most magnificent castle he had ever seen! It was several stories tall with hundreds of dark windows and half a dozen visible towers and he just knew that this castle was Hogwarts. 









The overhead levels of empty space faded into a cloudy blue sky, with sunshine that Hari could almost feel on his face. He swung his head around to his companion, only to stop when he spotted dozens of masked figures huddled in multiple half-circles. 









Every figure wore a black cloak with tapering hoods and bone-white masks. They reminded Hari of those muggles he has seen on the telly, only they wore white and he was vaguely sure they didn't each have decorated masks. Each circle had their own style, and Hari focused on one in the center who was steadily approaching him, the others parting like fog. 









Their mask was bone-white as the others, but as they came closer Hari could make out the details decorating it--golden swirls curled around the eye and nostril slits, while the mouth was carved out in a similar fashion to prison bars. 









They removed their mask, and Hari was met with a startling older version of himself. Shorter curls stuck around his face, glasses formed from the mist to settle on top of a nose that appeared to have been broken too many times to remain straight, but hazel eyes shone wrong. It appeared as if a stranger was staring at him through James' eyes. 









'I use to be part of a man who calls himself Voldemort.' His companion seemed very ashamed of himself, and very lost He curled around Hari's feet and worked his way up till his upper body was draped precariously over Hari's shoulders. 









'We were--I was-- A madman. I can hardly remember what it was like being in his head.....Everything felt so fractured and wrong. I could barely tell one day apart from the other, plans began intermingling, thoughts came and went and were forgotten.....' 









'But the night I became part of you is clear, Hari. You were supposed to kill me. You and another boy--Neville Longbottom. So I went after you both in the hopes of postponing my death. I both failed and succeeded.' 









Hari stilled, and he felt the snake slip from his shoulders. Absently, he thought he should probably be grateful for the space being provided by his companion, but all he could feel was terror. His heart began constricting in his chest, his breath catching as if Vernon's hand was wrapped around his throat. 









'My body was destroyed and I was put inside you, but that matters little at the moment.' Companion curled himself into a tight knot and laid his head on his body, mimicking a dog rolled onto its stomach. 'These are the Deatheaters. They were--are--Voldemort's followers, if you will. They.....we raided Saint Mungo's the night the two of you were born. I am unaware of the casualties, I was ripped away the moment I--' 









He cut himself off, his voice clinical and cold and rushed to get everything out.He seemed to curl impossibly tighter around himself before he spoke again, this time his voice very small, 'I--I am sorry. I cannot begin to imagine any apology that would convey how much I regret my actions. Nor have I yet decided which is the more fitting of punishments--to be unembodied, trapped incorporeally inside one of thousands of victims, or to gain back my mind, only to have the weight of my sins continue to rip apart the edges of my sanity. I--' 









He cut himself off once more, his voice growing heavy. Hari didn't think snakes could cry, but he didn't have any other name for the stilted, wet sounds coming from his Companion. felt conflicted.....This was the man who took his parents from him, who forced him with the Dursleys, the reason for everything..... 









But it wasn't. It was only a piece; of him, whatever that meant, and this piece certainly didn't seem the type to knowingly ruin Hari's life.....Mad men didn't cry after all, did they? 













And his companion certainly didn't have a say in Hari's choice of residence, and certainly didn't have a say in the way the Dursleys treated him. In fact, he had healed and taught Hari, going as far as to protect Hari when the punishments were too severe. 













Hari made up his mind. 













He knelt down, reaching out to pull the parts of the gargantuan snake that he could fit onto his lap. Companion seemed to simultaneously recoil from the touch and wrap himself around Hari, seeking more. He choked out stilted apologies with words Hari didn't understand, but accepted quietly anyway, each one loosening the death grip inside his chest. 













'It seem--It seems that the on-only comfort I may offer you,' He stopped, and took a deep, hissing breath, 'It seems that the only comfort I may offer you is that I can assure you I no longer consider myself Voldemort, let alone a piece of him.' Each word was slow and deliberate, and Hari stroked down his Companion's spine in a small attempt of affection. 













They stayed there for long moments before his Companion raised his head from his many coils to speak again, but all Hari knew was pain as he was physically ripped from his mindscape. 













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













One of the Ms. Petunias, a Mrs. Blanton, had seen Hari running back from the cross-sign and into the Dursleys yard. She had explained that she had seen this once before, a few months ago, and was frankly surprised that Petunia and Vernon could house such a thing. 













She had told her story in the middle of book club, in front of one Mrs. Hinz, a schoolteacher at the elementary. Several of the others confirmed either story, through first or second or millionth hand knowledge, which proposed a question about why wasn't he in school? from Mrs. Hinz. 













Petunia had to play her cards very carefully, explaining that Hari was born later in the year and therefore was expected to start in September with the other children. After all, they had only been housing him a few months. 













So when Hari received the news that he would be going to school in a few months by a smiling Ms. Petunia, he believed he was about to die. She told him that since he was a schoolboy now that he needed to be clean, and ushered him into the bathroom. He had been very confused as Ms. Petunia ordered him to strip and lay in the tub, until he placed his foot inside and it immediately went numb at the cold. 













This was a new game. 













He had snatched his foot out of the water almost as fast as Petunia backhanded him into the towel rack. She pulled him up by his hair and told him that he would either get in and stay in until Petunia came and fetched him, or she would drown him. 













Hari forced himself into the water, even as every cell in his being screamed at him for doing so.  













Ms. Petunia instructed him to lay in the water with his face lowered, or she would push it in. When Hari lowered his head till the water was brushing his cheeks, she had decided it wasn't fast enough and placed her long, thin hand over his face and pushed him down. 













Ice-water invaded his lungs and his numb limbs could barely put up a fight. The only thing he could do was cough and cause more water to invade his nose. When she finally let him up she kept her hand placed threateningly on his face, whispering very close to him,













""If you move a muscle, or so much as tilt your head, I'll call Marjorie and allow her mutt to do whatever it wants to you.""













She removed her hand and watched expectantly. Hari quickly sunk his head back underwater, careful to keep his nose just above enough the he could catch tiny breaths. Petunia huffed and slunk out the door, purposefully leaving it open.













Hari didn't know how long he was in there, only that it was long enough for his body to begin automatically shivering and long enough for it to stop.













Hari had tried to reach out to his companion, only to feel an emptiness where he once was.













The lack of the mental presence was more horrifying to Hari than his current situation. He didn't know what he would do without his companion. After all, he'd been there even before Hari could remember.













When Hari began to question if you could cry underwater, Petunia came in and twisted her fingers into Hari's hair and violently jerked him up. She lifted him so high that when she let go he felt a crack against his pelvis hitting the bottom of the bathtub. She pulled out an aluminum scrubber and an old bar of used soap before beginning to scrub him raw.













In some places she would simply leave it red, puffy, and heavily irritated. In others she didn't stop scrubbing until blood began dripping into the bathwater.













When he was finished with his bath Petunia told him that they were now being forced to buy him school supplies, and that Hari now owed them. In no uncertain terms did she make clear that Hari was ordered to do anything in order to pay them back. She didn't care about how he did it or what he did, and even less about what happened to him, as long as the debt was paid off in the end.













Then she had thrown an old shirt of Dudley's that had been dried too many times at him along with what he thought use to be pants but had been cut.













Then she had thrown him in his cupboard after he finished dressing.













Hari felt the weight of loneliness beginning to consume him. Without his companion he would have no one to turn to, no one to help him, no one who cared for him like his companion did.













He just wanted his friend back.













Silvery slick tears made their way down from his eyes and past his nose, over his cheek and onto the floor as he thought about a life without that sort of magic. He would give it up if he could have the voice back--he would take a dozen punishments all in a row.













'You're--ridiculous,' a voice whispered. It sounded older and more tired than his companion ever had, but Hari couldn't care less.














'Worrying over something like me....when you're practically freezing to death.'














'Where were you? What happened?' Hari asked fervently.













'You were awoken from your mindscape...A very dangerous thing to pull someone out of...especially someone untrained.' His companion took several heaving breaths, and Hari hugged himself tight when he felt sluggish scales graze against him.













Hari suddenly felt very awkward. When they had left off, his companion had been crying on him.














'So....you use to be this Voldemort guy?'















'Yes.'















'But you aren't anymore? You're like...your own guy?'















'...In lack of better phrasing--yes.'















'But you're still a part of me?'















'Yes. As I always will be.'














Hari felt a sort of muted elation--his companion would always be with him! He would never leave, never abandon Hari; he would live as Hari lived. Though now, Hari understood exactly how his companion had come to be. Despite his own sore excitement, he could feel sleep tugging at him as his magic worked to repair both himself and Companion.














'If you're your own person...then who are you?'















'I...do not know. I am no one, I suppose.'














Hari didn't think that sounded very nice.














'Well, what was your name before you were Voldemort?'














His companion seemed to hesitate, as if he was once again afraid.














'My name was Tom.'















'It's nice to meet you, Tom.'















'It's...It's nice to meet you too, Hari.'














Hari smiled and allowed sleep to claim him.

Three Strikes


(Or rather, ""You're Out"")


As promised, Hari began school in September. He attended West Bridge Elementary along with his now-known-to-be cousin Dudley, who was a year ahead of him in Year 3.

When questioned about where he went to Kindergarten, Hari had corrected him that he wasn't smart enough to go to Kindergarten, and that it was only for good boys like Dudley. His first teacher, Ms. Priskit, was horrified at the prospect of his parents instilling such ideas in him and praised the Dursleys for taking him under their wing, while his second teacher Ms. Trinsing laughed off his explanation as if he had told a silly joke.

And true to her word, Ms. Petunia did keep up with all the receipts of everything she bought him, adding in variables such as having to be seen with him and driving him around in their nice car. Even when she threw in the cheapest items that were most likely to break, she treated everything as if the mere prospect of spending money on him was causing her physical pain.

So when he began classes on September first, Hari knew he was woefully unprepared. Each child had several notebooks; Hari only had one. Many of the children had dozens upon dozens of brightly coloured pencils packed into plastic boxes; Hari only had a small ten-pack to last him through the year. Some children brought extra things, like sharpeners or erasers or crayons; Hari wore clothes that almost fit.

His first year had been dreadful. Every child wanting to know where he came from and why they hadn't seen him before and why was his skin different than their own? With a strong odor he couldn't help, dark skin instead of light, and clothes that were riddled with holes and too large on him--Hari was immediately an outcast.

No child wanted to be caught dead around Hari, which was something that pleased his cousin Dudley. Dudley took full advantage of the situation, and had beaten Hari into the wood chips of the playground. Hari had curled up and took it, and several children responded positively to his punishment.

When Dudley had been pulled off by a flustered Ms. Priskit, he forced large tears into his eyes and whined that Hari was making fun of his family. Hari glanced at other children, hoping for a rescue, but knew his fate at school was sealed when several of them nodded along with Dudley's story.

Since Dudley began to have the upper hand outside, Hari decided to have the upper hand inside. When being taught the letter system of grading he knew he could do better than the C's that Dudley came home with, that had small red pennings of try better next time! next to a smiley face.

Hari took the advantage of intelligence. He absorbed everything he could, marking his works in painfully neat handwriting that made his fingers cramp something awful. He would converse with his companion--with Tom--during storytime and recess (as he had taken to hiding inside), begging for him to teach Hari more about the simplistic things he was learning now.

So Tom complied.

Tom filled Hari with his magic and released knowledge over everything to do with these subjects. He let, and forced, his gift to be accepted into Hari's memory to mingle and become Hari's own. It caused Hari to black out the night they did it and arrive to school late for his second class, and for Tom to go missing for nearly two days.

But Hari was grateful. He knew he wouldn't get as far with his maths and language arts that he knew he could for a very long while. He also understood that Tom couldn't have a repeat performance for a long time, nor did he encourage such a big, forceful merging at one time. He explained that having too much at one time would eventually break Hari's mind. He wouldn't be able to sort facts from opinions, then memory from dreams, and then thoughts from actions. Hari would be lost in a reality all his own as his brain tried to force the foreign entity out of itself.

And so, Hari excelled at his schoolwork. His writing became neater the more he did it and hurt his fingers less, and he was always pleasant to his teachers. When his first report card came, he couldn't wait to show it off. 

After all, this must prove the Dursleys wrong, correct? He had received all A's with the highest marks in his class, even several stickers next to the smiley-faced 100s that littered his work. His companion praised him each time, and Hari could feel Tom expanding himself to fill Hari's mind as much as he could.

It was their version of a hug; at least while they were awake.

So when Hari received his report card with exemplary marks and a large, warm hug from Tom, he knew he couldn't let the Dursleys throw this away. He stuffed it down his pants and held it there with the ratted string that served as his belt. He knew the Dursleys wouldn't ask him about his marks--they never did--and so Hari had no reason to worry.

How very unfortunate when he returned to Number Four of Privet Drive, forty-five minutes later than Dudley as usual, to find Ms. Petunia smiling that smile at him and asking for his report card.

At first Hari tried to pretend that he didn't know what she was talking about, but all that did was earn him gaudy red nails digging into his arm and assuring him that Petunia was quite positive that he received his today.

Dubiously, Hari handed over his card. At the beginning of the day Hari had been proud of himself, but now it was all he could do to keep his body from quivering. Ms. Petunia curled up her nose as he removed it from his waistband, but snatched away as soon as it was a safe distance from his grubby clothes.

When she saw the line of As and the delicately written an all around exemplary student!; in the comments section her smile only grew.









""So,"" she had said. ""Not only a thief, but a cheat as well. How typical.""









She believed he had copied and stolen other students work, passing it off as his own to sympathetic brainless floozies. She screwed his arm back the wrong way, much like he had to Vernon, tugging him up close to her her.









""If I catch you cheating again,"" She had hissed, ""I'll snap your fingers.""









She punctuated her point by ripping back the first two fingers of Hari's right hand. They splintered with a sickening snap that had Hari biting through his bottom lip to prevent himself from screaming.









He learned that day to fall behind in class. To lie when the teachers asked him what was wrong, or if he was okay, or if he didn't understand. He learned that he had to be sub-par to Dudley, so that the Dursley's unextraordinary son could shine in the household.









It hadn't changed.









He barely scraped by to be thrown into third year as Dudley entered fourth. He was spurred on by watching Eunice begin to sit up on her own and learning to crawl. When she had begun to pull up on objects, watching her made Hari's heart ache terribly. And when she began to cry teething Hari thought his heart would just fall out. He purposely got himself in trouble despite Tom's frightful warnings when Eunice said her first word: Mumma. 









Despite the fact he hadn't held her, or had any close contact with her in a little over a year, Hari still adored her. He adored her pudgy feet that ran across the house all day, her high pitched giggles when she watched the princesses on the telly, and even her tantrums when Ms. Petunia tried to force her to wear something she didn't want to.









It was December now, and Eunice was turning two years old to Hari's seven and Dudley's nine. Ms. Petunia was planning a birthday party for her, which Hari thought was odd since the woman could barely stand to touch Eunice. Most of her preschool had been invited, except the odd child or few who hadn't lived up to the Dursley's standards.









So Hari was now slaving away after arriving back to Number Four from school. He was put in charge of preparing all sorts of pastries and sweets and decorations and gift bags that it made his head spin. 









His hands were covered in burns of varying degrees and sizing from the oven and the pans currently holding pink velvet cupcakes that Eunice had screamed for. The bottom layer of the cake was cooling on the counter, readying for the whipped icing Hari had to attempt four times in order to make correctly. He had to pop the cupcakes out of the loose-bottom baking tin with the thin end of a wooden spoon and pour in more mixture, setting the pan back in the oven with the next layer of cake.









While they were set to bake he dolloped a decent amount of icing onto Eunice's first layer and spread it messily, but evenly. She may be growing to despise him, but he couldn't help his unconditional love that still stuck inside him. He would make sure everything was perfect. From the pink and white buttercream icing to the Barbie figurine candles that would be sitting on top.









He had two hours to finish and he was spreading his magic around in order to help him--he didn't think he could do it otherwise. Recesses of the chill inside what Tom called his core went about surrounding the confections. It couldn't fill them, or they would be too cold and Hari would be punished. The more disciplined part of his magic forced ribbons to tie into bows that looked like the instructions laid out for him to follow, hung them, and forced them to stick with flicks of Hari's wrist and a mental Lignum.









Ever since he first discovered just how massive his magic was, Hari had been working on disciplining it under Tom's tutelage. Tom had taught him that his magic wasn't simply his magic, it was its own entity that had bound itself to Hari. Magic was living, aware, and wild. The less control you had over it, the easier it was for spells to backfire or simply not work, and you would exhaust yourself trying to force your magic to comply.









The relationship between Magia and Magic was of mutual benefit, Tom taught.










'Magic comes from the Gods, who come from the One. Magic is a direct connection from them to us.'










Magic was a gift, he had explained. Magic went to devout followers, prophets, priests, and those whom prophecies foretold about in the Days Before Days. Magical creatures had been the pure creations of the Gods--followers, servants, companions, as Humans were to the One. Some Magia even believed that magic was the One.









However, over time humans gave in to corruption. As borders were established and Houses raised, the Era of Ends began. Forceful impregnation of those with magic, and those magical beings human enough to breed with led to the modern Magia, Magical Creatures, and those half-born to both such as vampires or veela.









The connection to the Gods was mostly lost, left to priests and priestesses that hid in families that would become parts of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, The Dynasties of Magical Creatures, and the 13 Divines. Through these dozens of families, magic thrived. The Gods were worshipped in varying altars, stories were passed down with godly artifacts, and everything was good.










Until Magia began labeling magic; declaring who should practice what and which magics were immoral. Gods became outlawed to worship, pantheons were broken up, Houses and families were divided. 






Light and Dark became two warring sides of the same entity. And magic wept.






People began declaring themselves Lords of the Dark and of the Light, seeking to conquer the world and force society to follow their own ideals. Dozens of wars broke out, millions of lives were lost, and magic declared no more.









Those who were evil in their hearts and souls, undeserving of the gift that was magic, had it ripped away from their very core. Magic deemed it to follow their descendents until granted a union between a cursed soul and a blessed one.









And thus the Muggles were born.









And a new side of war broke out.









In the beginning, Muggles were slow and barbaric and could be stopped with simple spells by the Magia. But they began to advance faster than the blessed could ever hope to. They built armor and weapons out of minerals from the earth, surging attacks onto small Magia communities and taking them over. It became known as the Witching Wars. 









Magia were forced to go into hiding, pushing spells that barely held together in order to keep their communities safe and hidden. All was well, for a while. Until a Dark Lord from Neapose decided he wanted to make the entirety of Eurasia his dynasty, and re-sprung the wars between Dark and Light while the rest of the Magic world attempted to keep themselves hidden from the Muggle one.









Tom had told Hari that the war of the Dark Lord Tian Zhihao had happened over several thousand years ago. Tom had also told Hari that the wizarding world was still fighting wars, but they were so disconnected that England believed they were not in one. Hari had thought that that was rather ridiculous.









A ping from the oven told Hari that his cupcakes were ready. The cake would probably take another five to ten minutes. For the time being till then, Hari would begin filling the goody bags that Petunia had counted and labeled. She was rather obsessed with showing off, Hari thought.









It didn't matter though; Hari would put up for it. For Eunice.









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









It was now January. Christmas break had come and went and Hari had never been more grateful than he was when school re-started. 









For you see, Hari had a new plan.









His year 3 teacher, Mr. Prichard, let out class for recess before lunch. This meant that Hari had a very tiny opportunity each day throughout recess to go inside for a ""bathroom break"", slip inside classroom 17B, and rifle through the lunch pails of his classmates.









It was the first day he had dared attempt such an act, originally being too fearful of the consequences of being caught both by his peers and his teacher. Then Christmas break came along, and the Dursleys stayed home on sundays, and Hari nearly starved to death. 









He first went to a metal superhero lunch pail under the cubby name of Michael. Michael was a scrawny kid with a mean attitude, who bullied Hari particularly nasty when tests were passed around. Hari had no problem stealing from him, and knew that Michael's mother always packed him several sandwiches that he bragged about.









Hari only took the slices of ham from the ham-and-cheese sandwiches, and the package of crackers before moving on.





He was carefully selective so that he had a lesser chance of being caught: half a bag of grapes from Amelia, an entire peanut-butter sandwich from Ben (because really, who needed two?), and as much water as he could hold from the boy's bathroom before running back outside.









He stayed hidden in the shadows as usual, skirting around the teachers whenever another student came too close, and revelled in his victory.









At first he felt horrible whenever he returned to Number Four about his actions. But when Petunia announced her pregnancy again and began stocking up on non-perishables, it became tradition. Very rarely were there food scraps in the trash or left on plates in the sink now, and Hari hated it. 





As weeks went by children began noticing more and more food went missing. Snacks they had secretly packed from their parents were no longer to be found in their backpacks. Food they witnessed guardians preparing turned up missing when they opened their lunchboxes, or substantially less than they remembered. Naturally, they went to the teacher. Suspicion began to fall on Hari, the little boy who never had a lunch bag to bring to school. Mr. Prichard, in a spectacle of kindness Hari had never seen, had pulled Hari aside at the end of March and asked him if he was the one responsible for the missing food. Hari had refused adamantly in the beginning, trying to cast blame on others, on anyone else than himself, but finally, tearfully gave in and told the older man the truth.









Mr. Prichard had called the Dursleys and told them what had been happening, and that perhaps they should pack a lunch for him to prevent such behavior in the future. Ms. Petunia had put on the perfect act, simpering into the phone about how jealous Hari was with Eunice and Dudley and now the baby that was on the way, and that she would make sure that Hari got to school with the lunches she packed. She even threw a few lines about how Hari had been picking on Dudley, and that she feared her boy may have been swiping his lunches as revenge.









Hari thought about walking into oncoming traffic on his way back as he heard Mr. Prichard and Ms. Petunia conversing over the speakerphone.





Hari was made to stay after class so his teacher and his guardians could have a small meeting. As he sat on the hard, plastic chairs of his classroom he wished his magic would suck him up like a black hole. Petunia and Vernon had come in the perfect picture of a loving, domestic couple. Petunia holding Eunice's small hand, her own free hand clutching suggestively around her stomach, Vernon having his arm gently wrapped around her lower back.









And there sat Hari; a small, dirty boy with a strange name and no parents who had just gotten caught stealing.





Mr. Prichard had set up two more ""adult"" chairs at his desk along with Hari's right beside him. When Vernon and Petunia took their seats, with Eunice in Petunia's lap, Hari prayed that the universe could just delete itself.









""Mr. And Mrs. Dursley,"" Mr. Prichard began slowly, expecting a warm first-name allowance by the couple. It was not given. He cleared his throat as moved on, faintly red-faced, ""I wanted to meet with you to call to your attention Hari's behavior lately.""









""Why don't we just pinch right to the point, Mr. Prichard?"" Petunia sighed. ""Hari's been thieving, and it's all our fault."" To Hari's confusion and utter horror, she began to sniffle.









""We've tried to raise him right these past two years, but--but--"" she cut herself off with a sob and leaned in to Vernon, who slipped his large arm around her and muttered comforting words into her ear.






  ""Oh good heavens, that's not what I meant to imply!"" Mr. Prichard groped around his necktie as beads of sweat began to collect on his temple. ""I understand it's difficult taking in a child that has a rather--different--background and you two are nothing but admirable for doing such a thing!"" He assured.










""I simply wished to discuss with Hari why he's been acting out, so that perhaps the issues at home would be solved along with the issues here at West Bridge.""









Petunia pulled out a delicate lace handkerchief and dabbed around her heavily made up eyes before wiping her nose. She gave Hari a very distinct look and asked him, ""Yes darling, why have you been acting out so?""









And all eyes were on him. He picked at the skin around his fingernails and gave a small shrug of his shoulders. Eunice surprised everyone by speaking up.









""'s jus' 'cause he's bad, that's why!""









Petunia placed a dragon-claw-like hand upon her daughter's brown hair. Hari could see Petunia's red nails beginning to twist in the curls and pull just hard enough to let off as a warning. Vernon's face began to redden as Mr. Prichard's attention was diverted to the small girl.









""What do you mean he's 'bad', honey?""









Eunice's hair was given a sharp but subtle tug as another warning. She would be punished if she got this answer wrong. Her and Dudley's punishments were never as bad as Hari's...but they still hurt.









""He--He breaks m' dolls suh'times. An--An' pulls m' hair.""









She thought it best to tell what Dudley did instead of Hari. When the grip on her hair was lessened, she knew she made the right choice and snuggled into her Mumma's chest.









""How long has this behavior been going on? You mentioned he had been picking on your son?"" Mr. Prichard gestured vaguely from Ms. Petunia to Hari and back again.









""I believe,"" she sniffled, ""I believe that it's been going on ever since we adopted him."" She put special emphasis on the word.









""Adopted? Oh, my, well--exactly what has Hari been doing?""









Petunia's eyes gleamed and she elbowed her husband. ""Oh I just couldn't--""









""He's been nothing but a menace! My Petunia is too soft on the boy, I say. He needs a strong military upbringing. He's always all over our boy Dudley, and he's begun to go after Eunice! Who's to say he wouldn't attack our baby when it comes?""









Mr. Prichard looked both shocked and a little puffed up. It was well known that Mr. Prichard had served in the military many years ago, and that he had a soft spot for other military men (despite the fact that Vernon had never served in a military of any sort).









He cast his eyes down to Hari and squared up his shoulders, attempting to look impressive in front of Mr. Dursley. ""Well, Hari, what do you have to say for yourself?""









Hari knew what the Dursleys wanted him to say. He was jealous. But he knew Mr. Prichard wouldn't believe him if he simply copied their words...but he would get in trouble if he didn't...









""I suppose I just want a family, sir. A real family."" Hari answered carefully. ""Dudley has a Mum and a Dad and a little sister and now another baby on the way and I'm...I'm just Hari.""









He made sure to kick his feet together and pick and his fingers. The more nervous he looked the more Mr. Prichard was likely to believe him.









His teacher looked at him with sad, pitying eyes. Hari hated the feeling.









""Hari I'm sure that if you tried, you'd find that you have family as well. You have wonderful guardians and siblings.""









Hari nodded morosely.









""Hari,"" he snapped his head up at Petunia. She had never addressed him before.









""We are trying, but we can't be your real family if you don't let us. Will you let us be your family Hari, and be a good boy?""









She gave him a sickly sweet smile and Hari new there was to be a new game.









""I'll be a good boy,"" he whispered, his gaze downcasted.









""That's all I needed to hear, darling.""

Searching for Something I Cannot Find


(Or rather, a Loss of Oneself)


Since the day that the Dursleys and Mr. Prichard had had their meeting, Petunia had become absolutely vicious. It was nothing compared to how she was before, as she even began withholding meals from the younger two children. When questioned by an angrily whining Dudley or an innocently curious Eunice, she would sneer and hiss to go ask it.  

Hari no longer was worthy of names, or direct addressment. Instead, Petunia began to refer to him as it. Vernon and the children soon followed suit.

When Petunia began withdrawing meals, the children began to blame it. Dudley would take advantage of his large size and strength and beat the freak until his knuckles hurt. Eunice was small, but smart. She decided to do things that could get him in trouble.

She knew that Mumma and Dadda made sure that  it never did any special nonsense, and Eunice had only witnessed this a few times. She could remember once that it made all the windows crack without touching them, just because Petunia had been disciplining her. So, she decided to tattle to her Mumma about all the nonsense that it would get up to, even if all of it had come from her head and both her and her Mumma knew it wasn't true.

It didn't matter, because her Mumma loved her.

And Hari, poor Hari, had become more depressed. He became uninterested in his books, and brushed off or even went as far as to silence Tom whenever he spoke up. He shut his magic away; He shut his feelings away; and Hari shut himself away.

School had become worse if possible, since beginning year 4. Children were beginning to become more physical in their attacks of him, and he didn't think it would take much longer before he was being cornered by others than Dudley. None of the teachers seemed to intervene, as all the boys seemed to back up each others stories. Even a nervous, bruised, bleeding Hari would attempt to fess up to tell the teachers it was his fault.

Even Ms. Priskit, now Mrs. Grindin, was no longer interested in Hari the troublemaker. At first, she had relayed her fears to Principal Henderson, but was alieved by Mr. Prichard, who proved that the Dursleys were good caretakers through his meeting with them and with the brown sack that now accompanied Hari to lunch every day.

No one suspected that Hari was being forced to vomit it up after school.

The first time Petunia had presented him with a simple paper sack, Hari had nearly laughed. She instructed him to take it with him to school, and apologize to Mr. Prichard for its lying. She had told him that this would cut into his debt and that he had better start looking for work.

During lunch he carefully unrolled the brown sack to reveal a single, plain cheese sandwich. He wolfed it down with a vengeance and had been begrudgingly grateful to Mr. Prichard for putting him in this situation in the first place.

When he returned back to what he now deemed the House, Hari was promptly led back to the bathroom. He had thought that the bath game waited for him, as Petunia had taken to using it quite often when issues of his nonsense arose or she felt that he had been particularly bad.

Instead, the bathtub was empty, and the toilet lid was up. She had shoved Hari to his knees in front of the bowl and and ordered him to vomit. Hari had tried to gag and cough the first few times, and Petunia had gotten fed up with how long he was taking.

She had ripped his head back by his black curls and forced her fingers down in his mouth. Her long, thick nails had scraped against his insides and Hari could faintly taste blood over the convulsing of his throat. When Petunia ripped out her fingers it was near instantaneous for Hari to retch into the bowl. It was horrid and acidic and faintly pink coloured, and when he coughed blood spattered against the inside of the toilet bowl.

She hadn't believed that that was the end, and when her fingers dug back into Hari's hair he couldn't help his reaction. His hands flung up and clawed at hers as he begged, ""Please, please, I can finish myself--I'll be good, I promise, I promise!""

He became a quivering mantra of half-gurgled, half-whimpered pleadings and promises to 

be good and to finish himself. When she stepped back, Hari became a sobbing mess of thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. And then Hari had to reach his own tiny fingers in his mouth, past the point he was definitely comfortable with, and willed himself to jam his fingers even further back as far as he could. He wasn't as lucky as Petunia to pull his fingers out before he began be sick.

He was made to do it thrice more, each time trying harder and harder to pretend he couldn't taste the still-wet, sickly-sweet copper on his fingers, or that he couldn't feel the scrapes and gashes along the inside of his throat, or that he wasn't even in this situation at all. 

And each day, he believed his pretending a little less, and his horror became a little more real.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

As ordered, Hari had gotten odd jobs around the private community of Little Whinging; but most people wouldn't hire him because of his skin or his school record. Those that did paid him little, or ripped him off completely. The only exception was his beloved Ms. Figg, who would pay him simply for his time.

It became an odd sort of ritual for Hari, that after school and after his punishment, to stop by and check his usual houses for jobs before going off to Ms. Figg's. The only days that she may have been missing were Sundays, and she had told Hari that he was welcome during then anyway to keep away from the Dursleys.

Hari learned an awful lot about Ms. Figg in the time it took Petunia to birth one Mildred Claire Dursley between January 21st and May 29th. He learned that on Ms. Figg had used to be married to a man named Capricus Grom who had took her last name when they married. He learned that Ms. Figg was currently a squib, but hadn't been born one (something that had greatly shocked Tom).


Hari had learned that the same war that took her husband and permanently injured her son was also the same war that took her magic. Hari learned that Ms. Figg went to go visit Cristiano on Sundays, and that the good days were the days that he didn't recognize his mother. 

She didn't speak about the bad ones.

Hari had also began to learn much of the English wizarding world. He learned the currency, and its Muggle equivalence, and had begun to have been tutored by Ms. Figg in the basics of standard (and not-so-standard) wizard education, when Mildred had come along.


Hari became very grateful for the small hoards of pocket change he kept at Ms. Figg's when he was once again assigned baby duty. He became very grateful because Petunia's familial hunger game apparently extended towards her very nearly newborn baby, and had said that Hari would have to buy Mildred's formula itself. She had also offhandedly mentioned that if her child starved, Hari would have wished it had been him.

So Hari had begun a new ritual. His day began at 12-a.m, as Tom taught, and ended at 11:59-p.m. He would first stay up with Mildred in his cupboard for all hours of the day until school, rocking her quietly between his arms and soothing her with blanket-curls of magic. When he had to head to school he would wrap her up in the largest, cleanest shirt he had and set her in the makeshift cot of clothes overlaid with his old, cleaned dishrag. He would sleep through classes (his teachers had long since given up on him), before rushing home as fast as he could at the beginning of lunch to check on and care for Mildred, and rush back just in time for the end of recess. After school he would once again force his legs to run until they felt like they would burst to get back to the House, simply to check on and care for his baby again, and then took her with him when he went to Ms. Figg's.

He now went first to the woman who felt like his mother and dropped off Mildred before running back and forth between his usual houses, and some odd ones that sometimes offered him a job or two. Then he would go back to Mildred and Ms. Figg, and simply be. And they would be happy, most days of most weeks, for an hour a day. Until Hari had to return.

Hari could count on Ms. Figg spending money from his jar on things Hari thought of as essentials. She wrote down each cost of every item and how much it left Hari with (and if there was more boxes than were counted on the receipts and more money in Hari's jar, well Ms. Figg never said anything). Hari used Ms. Figg's spare bedroom as Mildred's storage room, under Ms. Figg's insistence.

Now, instead of a large, king sized bed there was a double twin bed shoved in the corner opposite the door, covered in quilts and pillows Ms. Figg had made herself. Instead of a lavish, corner-made China cabinet, there was now a proper crib for Mildred.

Instead of magically cleaned clothes that Hari still felt iffy about, there was now a beautiful redwood rocking crib with great fluffy cats carved into the head and baseboard. As months went by and Ms. Figg assured Hari that Mildred could process moving pictures, he made the cats move with an offhanded suggestion made by Tom.

And as Mildred became older and Hari taught her to smile and roll and hold up her head, he expected Petunia to take her from him. But she didn't. Instead she began preparing for Eunice's birthday and ordered Hari to stay out of the house longer than usual.

A week before Eunice turned three is when she caught Hari shushing a crying Mildred and singing to her. Eunice went stiff and simply watched as Hari cradled her baby sister and whispered over and over again that he loved her.

Mumma never held her like that.

Mumma never sang to her.

Mumma never told her that Mumma loved her...

Eunice felt jealousy roll up in her tummy as large, round tears made their way down her face much to her horror. She felt very much that she should be the one Hari was holding and singing to...and a faint whisper in her head said that maybe once she had been?

Her sniffles had caused Hari to whip his head around to face her so fast that for a moment Eunice was afraid for him that he may snap his neck right in two. And then he looked at her...like he looked at Mumma. 

""Please, please, please don't tell, Eunice--Mil-Mildred's sick and I--I can't get her to calm down, please, I'm sorry.""

Here he was...begging her...like he begged Dudley when Dudley hit him. Like she begged Dudley when he decided to hit her. Tears swept down her face faster than before and she brought up her hands to try to choke back her whimpering.

""Why--why doesn't my Mumma l-love me like--like that?""

The mirror in the bathroom began to quake and crack and Eunice was afraid that Hari might punish her for speaking ill about her Mumma. She was very surprised when instead of a sharp slap across the face that usually left shallow cuts, she was engulfed in thin arms and squished against a flat chest and a warm bundle.

""Hey, it's okay...""

And then he was singing to her. Singing to her and holding her like she was precious to him. And she no longer had quite sobs, and neither did Mildred, and they were happy.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













When Eunice began to purposely cause up trouble in the hopes that her mother would send her with Hari, Hari thought his heart would stop. She would push over expensive vases, rip up flowers in the garden, and spill food, all within sight of her mother or when she was the only logical culprit.













Even when the backs of her legs began to permanently adopt shades of purples and yellows, some with blistering welts that oozed pus if she scratched them, Eunice persisted. She would purposefully muss up her Mumma's makeup and stain her nice clothes with food, or misplace her Mumma's nice jewelry, and even nicked through her purse once. It never mattered much to Eunice, since when she came limping to Hari's cupboard he would hold her (and let her hold Mildred) and sing the Horse song to her and use what he called magic to make her hurts go away.













And Eunice had become very attached to Hari, and very attached to Mildred, whom she now addressed as Millycat. When Mildred would cry in the cupboard with Hari, Eunice would sing the Horse song that Hari had been teaching her to calm Millycat down. Hari had told her that his Mumma sang it to him when he was a baby. It made Eunice feel very special.













Sometimes during the Horse song, when it was late at night, Hari would even make horses. He could make tiny horses that looked like they were made from the fireplace-smoke gallop around the small enclosure, whinny quietly, and even nuzzle the young girls.













It was Dudley's tenth birthday on June 23rd that Eunice was caught talking to it  by their Aunt Marge.













Marjorie Nelson-nee-Dursley had seldom come around Little Whinging, both due to her dislike of Petunia and her intense hatred of Hari. When she did visit, she always made sure to bring her current dog who she had trained to have an intense distrust for coloured people. Since Razor had died four years ago, she decided to keep his best son as her new breeding male, and he was completely brutal.













Hari had no fond memories of what he knew was his Aunt Marge. The first time he had met her (that he could remember) was when he had been a little older than three at Dudley's fifth birthday. Dudley had demanded that Hari join him and his best friend Piers Polkiss in a game of musical chairs. Hari was quicker, however, and won most of the games. In retaliation, Mrs. Nelson had whipped around Hari's legs with her walking cane for humiliating Dudders at his birthday! Later that day she had sent Razor after him, and Hari ended shut up in his cupboard, crying, while the beastly bulldog clawed and snarled outside his flimsy door. She had decided to stay over the weekend, and Hari was not allowed out while she was inside the house, and dare not venture outside when he believed Razor would be waiting for him.













She had only visited during Dudley's seventh, ninth, and now tenth birthday, all due to Dudley's incessant pleading. Hari was rather grateful to whomever kept her from visiting regularly, and thought he couldn't possibly have hated the woman more. That was until she caught Eunice telling Hari a silly joke she had learned off the telly.













Marge had ripped both of them up by their arms and dragged them to the kitchen, to report to Vernon in front of Petunia what she had seen. That Eunice had been talking to it, joking and laughing with it.













Hari had had Mildred ripped away from him moments later, and had had Eunice taken away all over again. He was forced to watch as Eunice was disciplined by Aunt Marge and her cane. Eunice, in turn, was forced to lay whimpering on the floor as Marge and Petunia punished Hari. She couldn't have moved, even if she had felt like she deserved to. When Vernon decided to punish Hari, and invited Dudley to help, Eunice became very ashamed of herself.













Eunice became very ashamed because she turned away from Hari, whose dull dull dull eyes stared at her like her dolls did, and she simply shut her eyes and clapped her hands over her ears.













Hari wasn't supposed to look like that.













Hari wasn't supposed to sound like that.













Hari wasn't dull or lifeless; her Hari was warm and loving and so so so full of hope. 













And his screams began permeating through her poor barriers and she simply screwed her eyes shut tighter and clamped her hands down harder against her ears.













--broken, hurting, because of her.













It seemed like a very long time to Eunice before Hari stopped screaming. It was even longer when his silence stretched on and the curses that flew from her relatives' mouths and the muted thumps of fists against flesh echoed around her skull. Tears leaked from her eyes when they finished with Hari and she was suddenly scooped up into large arms, shushing her.













Her Dadda pat her back and told her that they disciplined her because they loved her and that it was necessary. Eunice nodded into his shoulder and watched Hari's form soak up more of the dark, growing puddle beneath him from over her Dadda's back.













Eunice broke down that night, for Hari, and told herself that she deserved each bruise blossoming on her skin for getting him in trouble.













She whispered the melody of Hari's horse song, and cried herself to sleep.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













Hari had been left in the kitchen when Mr. Vernon had gathered up Eunice. He couldn't bring himself to be worried over her, or himself, or angry, or anything.














All Hari knew was pain, and even that began to fade out with the sleep that tugged at him.













 'Do not fall asleep!' 













But sleep sounded wonderful and Hari hurt so much.













 'Hari if you fall asleep you will die.' 













That sounded nice, Hari supposed. If he died, he wouldn't hurt anymore, and he could probably sleep all he wanted.













Hari's mind was suddenly filled with thousands of overlapping buzzes, complete with sharp, mental prods that Hari equated much to stingers. He shifted on to floor, groaning when his mouth met a silky, coppery-tasting substance that seemed to stain his face.













Hari hadn't known a person could bleed that much...














'Hari, wake up! Now!'














And his body was forcibly lurched against Hari's own willing. He watched, fascinated, as his hands began to spasm and plant themselves on the floor, pushing him up. Hari didn't make them do that...in fact, now that he thought about it, he was even losing feeling in his arms, and now his legs.













He felt bones forcibly snap back into place. When they couldn't set themselves automatically, Hari was left with joints grinding against each other that caused him terrible amounts of pain.













His body got up without Hari's consent. Every action was made without Hari's order, awkwardly making his way toward his cupboard. He looked like a puppet with tangled strings being dragged towards his destination, and dropped like one with its strings cut once inside.













His whole body felt like burning hot needles were being pushed inside excruciatingly slow. Over the mind-numbing pain that filled Hari's mind he could barely make out Tom's desperate I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. 













Then his back was arching, nearly snapping in half. Blinding agony swept through him and Hari swore even his hair hurt.













He could barely make out shapes in the darkness, his eyes blurring together and being overcome with fantastical colours. They grew in his vision, in all shapes and hues, and took over any light that was visible to him. 













And then, all the sudden, everything was dark, and Hari was no longer aware.













He could faintly feel consciousness brushing his dreams of having tea with Ms. Figg, with a tiny brunette girl in a pretty pink dress taking up the green armchair and cooing at newborn kittens. The image was thin, like dust, waiting to be reshaped into a room Hari had been getting to know all-too-well. There was a bed full of homemade quilts and pillows against the far wall, and opposite it was now a bunk bed. The top tier had sheets of faint pink and the bottom of cool yellows.













His pain faded away with the dust of ever-changing scenes of Hari and his girls at Ms. Figg's, having tea parties or singing or showing them magic-- 













And in his dreams, Hari was happy. They ended far too soon for his liking, and began slipping away quicker than Hari would have preferred (Hari would have liked to hold on to them forever, but.....) He fought against his consciousness, as much as he could, desperate to stay in his dreams. But alas, he failed, and woke to something he much more readily would have believed was a dream.













At the time that Hari had awoken, he began panicking at the holes in his vision. They were like tiny pinpricks of swirling stars in random patterns scattered throughout what was left of his sight. They didn't necessarily obscure what he could see, more like pin-sized black holes sucking in everything around it. When he tried to focus on one or the other, they grew. Translucent light spiderwebbed from them, connecting each star together before merging into one. One that opened. It was like a greater version of opening his eyes--watching it split open like an eye all its own and reveal a whole other world.













It looked almost like the space cartoons Hari caught glimpses of on the telly when he cleaned; swirls of deep, aware colours that varied in hues Hari knew and ones that Hari could never imagine. He could feel the consciousness from the world in front of him, laughing at him affectionately.








""Such a promising child,"" a voice, an eerie mix of Ms. Figg and Lily, seemed to resonate from the space. ""Yet such pain lies ahead of you...""














It seemed to contemplate, the silks of its being--her being?--ruffled like Ms. Petunia's curtains in the breeze.













""I suppose you'll do,"" It teased, pushing him back out of the expanse gently. ""Awake now, child, for I fear the alternative is quite unfavourable."" 













It confused Hari, for wasn't he awake now? But then he watched as the spiderwebs reappeared throughout the eye he was looking through and closed, reforming the stars that afflicted his vision beforehand.













And then they seemed to blur out of his perception. If he focused he could still take notice of some of them, but they no longer directly distracted him. He rubbed his hands against his eyes to try to dislodge the remaining ones, if he even could, only to freeze when he felt up along his scar. His scar had grown. Now it wasn't such a strange concept to Hari, since when he was four it barely stretched across half of his forehead and the last time he had seen it in Ms. Figg's fancy bathroom mirror it had been running down and beginning to intercept his right eyebrow. Now, however, he could feel it past his eyebrow and working its way around his eye.













Anxiously Hari traced the raised skin to where he knew it would end, or rather, where he thought it would end. Instead of grazing just at his hairline, now it extended in a slow curve that started to aim at his ear. Hari was horrified.













He had an inkling that his scar-growth was tied to the now absolutely giant mindscape Tom who gleamed a deep, lake-muck green, punctuating with what resembled black eyes along his body. His head was now the length of Hari's head and torso, and over twice as thick. His body could of easily swallowed Vernon, and while Hari was happy that his friend was getting better, he was fearful of what his friend did in order to cause his scar and Tom's mental body to grow at such a rate in such little time.













Hari began to think that perhaps his companion, Tom, was more than he was letting on.

Mother, May I?


(Or rather, Dreams are Dreams are Dreams)


Tom only raised more questions than he gave answers when Hari had asked him what he did. 'A blood ritual, of sorts I suppose...'  He had said, but even he seemed unsure.


'I called upon several Gods, asking them for their favour, to save your life. One seemed to answer.'


Tom had then pondered exactly which of the apparent twenty-odd Celestials he had called on could have healed Hari.

'I suppose it could have been Cerridwen...she is a Mother God, or Goddess I suppose,'  he corrected when he sensed Hari's confusion, 'Yet she is considered a Dark Goddess, and would have little to do with intervening in someone's death.'

He had listed off several others, such as Danu, Durga, Amaterasu, Hera, or even Gaia, whom Tom claimed seldom interfered with earthly affairs.

'Well...she sounded like Lily and like Ms. Figg?' Hari had tried.


'Mother Goddesses often will. That is, sound like those you see as a maternal guardian. What did she look like?'


Hari was rather surprised. After all, Tom was in his head, so shouldn't that mean that he should have been able to see her too? Hari half thought he may have been losing his grip on reality, because these things simply didn't happen to normal people. Normal people couldn't rip open nothing and see into space. Normal people didn't have complete other people in their heads. But...He thought back to the silk-like textures inside the other world. The other world that apparently was inside his mind. He wouldn't give that up, even if it meant sanity. Her voice, that sounded so much like Lily and so much like Ms. Figg...the way the energy inside, the very world itself pushed him gently, like a mother ushering forward her child.


'She didn't look like anything...it was all colours and stars, like outer space.'


Tom was silent for a moment. 'There is a high chance that you ventured into the outer reaches of her realm.'


'...what?'


Tom scoffed, as if Hari should know this. 'Every Celestial has a realm, where they decide to build their kingdom. Where they hold their powers, like Heaven would be for Yahweh. It is--not another dimension--but another layer upon reality. Each realm is connected to the Spirit Worlds, and followers of Gods usually venture from there to their Patrons' domain.'


'So...I was in this God's realm?'



'Not quite. You were more standing outside the door of the realm, or caught between the walls. You were inside the bridge that connects there, by her allowance.'


Well, at least it made sense to why everything looked like it was barely held together. Hari just wondered if the actual ""inside"" would look better...

'How could I get there anyway? Can anyone go?' Hari meant Magia, and nearly smacked himself for his mistake. When he wasn't specific, he usually got long lectures about information he hadn't wanted in the first place.


'Yes and no. Followers can go to their specific Gods realms. Magia and Muggles can visit only after death or by being chosen. Priests of Gods, or chosen ones such as Prophets or the Favoured, can visit at will after being trained how. In the Spirit World, spirits can roam anywhere they please, unless banned or held by a specific God.'


Muggles could go to a God's realm? Hari supposed it made sense, since they were descended from Magia in the first place...but still.


'So...she saved me because I'm chosen?'



'No. She saved you because when I called out, offering your services in exchange for not dying, she took an interest. She saved you because in that moment she chose you.'


'You offered what!?' He was going to be a slave? Not only to some no-good obscenities that Ms. Figg would definitely not approve of Hari using, but now to some God that Hari didn't even know?


'Your services. Such as becoming a Champion or a Priest.'


Oh. Well, that didn't sound too bad. Hari vaguely recalled a Champion being someone who was rather like a knight, and he knew a Priest was someone that taught and ministered a church. He pondered a bit--if his new Patron, he supposed, was a Mother Goddess, then there couldn't be too many looking to fight her, right?

'Oh. So all I have to do is defend her honor or whatever, or ""spread her word""?' The sarcasm was heavy on his tongue. He had learned that particular phrase from the church shows Ms. Petunia enjoyed watching on Sundays and Wednesdays. Hari doubted he could ever take himself seriously again if he began speaking like the men on those shows.


'Not quite. You would fight in her name, in whatever role she chooses. If she chooses you to be a Knight, then you will slay her enemies as you can. If she chooses you to be a Healer, you would fight the wars on sickness; injustice for the sick, prejudice against the hopelessly diseased, and your weapon would be cures instead of curses. If she chooses you to be a Necromancer, you will do so; communing with the deceased and assisting those who need it.'



'And I could do that or be a Priest?'


'No,' Tom shifted inside his head, almost like a silent sigh, 'You would become that and a Priest. Since she actually took the time to save your life, I would think that it may be one of the Minor Goddesses in a pantheon, one with not many followers. Therefore, she needs both.'

'Oh.' Well then. Hari preferred the idea of becoming a Healer, since he wasn't too big on killing anyone, or even thought he could give Necromancy a try (even if he absolutely wasn't scared of ghosts, thank you very much). He thought back to ""You'll do"" from the being he now knew to address as female. She said he would do, but what exactly would he do for?


'Can I ask her? What I want to be, I mean.'



'I suppose you could, if you contacted her. You would need to know her name first.'


Hari huffed through his nose. He did that quite a lot when he was irritated.


'Well if you hadn't asked so many of those--Gods or whatevers--then I would know her name.'


Hari felt Tom sulk around in his head, scales flaring out slightly like Snowy's fur when she was angry. There were low, sarcastic hisses emanating from the back of Hari's head. Well, if Tom wanted to pout, so be it. It was his fault anyway.


'Oh yes, thank you Tom for saving my life. Oh no, no really, thank you for going out of your way to save me. And thank you so much for going out of your way to teach me.'


Hari giggled quietly to himself. Tom often did this, mocking Hari or trying to guilt trip him. He always apologized later, but he was entertainingly antagonistic.


'Oh please, you know you'd die of boredom if you didn't teach me.'


And then there were scales absolutely bristling against his mind. He tried to muffle his laughter behind his hands. Oh, now Tom would pout for a while, but it was worth it.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

After Tom had finished throwing his fit, he finally told Hari that there was a way to narrow down which Goddess had chosen him, and then figure out exactly which one it was through trial and error. Apparently, all Hari had to do was meditate and build his Occlumency shields and his Legilimency skills. Tom explained that they were mind magics and that Hari had already been subconsciously practicing them, both with his communication with Tom and in learning how to escape to his mindscape.

However, he would have to delve deeper into his mind through meditation and contact that world again, pulling it into his mind and trying to decipher it. That was where Legilimency came into play. He would have to sort of read the Goddess's mind, something that Hari thought was a very bad idea. Tom assured him that since she was a Goddess, no one could slip in undetected and certainly not without her permission. It wouldn't even be the actual mind reading--it would be more like interpreting, Tom said.


'Besides, it'll be fun! I've never done this before.'


That certainly reassured Hari. Reassured him more that he was going to be smote by a pissed off Goddess more than anything, but he supposed it count.

So that's what they did, for months. When Hari was locked away in his cupboard--they meditated. When Hari was lying incapacitated after punishment--they slipped away to his mindscape. At night, when Hari was supposed to be sleeping--he found that even if he had mentally been awake all night, physically he wasn't exhausted.

The more they practiced the more changes Hari would notice about himself. His magic, at first wild and free and only partially domesticated like a lion that was no longer hungry, was now soft but strong. It prowled around Hari like a large predator, waiting. It came to his call near instantly, with or without verbal orders to direct it. While he couldn't quite reach the world again, he could spread open the stars in his sight to catch glimpses and tastes of her magic.

And oh, was it intoxicating.

It felt like being wrapped up by Ms. Figg and being back inside his mother's womb and being filled with love. It was Ms. Figg's tea that was terribly sweet and the song he remembered just barely, the way that Ms. Priskit use to smile at him and give him sparkling stickers and blue.



'Her eyes are blue.'



'What?'



'Her eyes--the Goddess--they're blue.'


Tom seemed flabbergasted, for he didn't say anything the next moment. There wasn't even any movement in Hari's head before,


'That--That's literally nothing. Absolutely--I mean absolutely--phenomenally useless information.'


Hari decided to use his newly found Occlumens shields to drown out and silence his companion. Now that Hari could choose whether or not to listen to Tom's toddler-like tirades, Hari often chose not to. Trust Tom to ignore that Hari had finally made progress and discovered something about the Goddess in the seven months they had been practicing, all in favour of scolding him about how useless it was.

Ignoring the muted banging against his walls, which was probably a hissy-fitting Tom angry that Hari wasn't listening to him pitch, Hari chose to delve back into his mindscape. It had changed from the castle expansion that Tom had originally created, and now featured a duplicate of Ms. Figg's house in a partial rainforest. Inside were mental projections of Ms. Figg, Eunice, and a growing Mildred, along with each of Ms. Figg's strange-looking cats. They didn't do much, merely said what Hari remembered one of them saying now or then or what Hari imagined they would say, and the cats butt their heads against all the furniture and loved the girls. All in all, it became Hari's happy place.

It also became the only grasp of Ms. Figg Hari now had, as since that day he had been banned from going out again. If the neighbors wanted his work, they would come directly to the Dursley's, who would charge quite a bit of money. It drove many customers away, and attracted several creepy ones that Hari despised working for. Just in case, Tom gave him a few curses if one of them tried anything. Even though none of them hadn't so far, Hari was still wary.

It only made his ventures to his mindscape more meaningful, and filled him with determination to do better. It drove him to work harder, to push himself past his limits and absolutely exhaust himself.

Ms. Figg gave him tastes of freedom, love, and family, completed by Eunice and Mildred. Hari had these things in his grasp, and he was not willing to give them up. Hari had just been surviving for so long, but now--Hari wanted to live.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It was June once again; Mid-June to be exact. It was to be Dudley's birthday in a mere five days, and Petunia was antsy. Marjorie had agreed to come for a visit, which would make the odd three year visit in a row, and stay until the end of July. Hari was, decidedly, not thrilled.

Customers had been shooed away from renting Hari so that he could clean the house until he absolutely ached. Instead of mopping the two--technically four--story house, Hari was ordered to scrub it with a dishrag. Instead of the usual downstairs and upstairs, he had to scrub the attic, the basement, and even the garage. Hari thought it all rather ridiculous, but kept that to himself and Tom. He polished silverware after hand washing it and running it through the dishwasher, waxed the wooden furniture in the house that could be waxed, and vacuumed daily since the beginning of June.

It was a nonstop process of constant cleaning. From the time Hari awoke to the time he exhausted himself into his mindscape, or actually slept, Ms. Petunia would find busywork for him to do. 


""Clean the gutters!""



""Weed the garden!""



""Mow the yard!""


Even if he had done it all a week, a few days, or even a single day before, Petunia persisted. By the 17th of June, Hari was left feeding his magic into the soil of the gardens to prevent the plants from looking completely mangled and spreading it throughout the yard to boost the growth of the grass simply so he could shave it half a hair. It stretched his magic more than he ever had and left him worn out, but it gave Hari a rush. To feel his magic seep into each plant and wrap around it, threading through it, was a feeling like nothing Hari had ever experienced. He could almost feel their pulse of life, their own brand of magic, and it was  fascinating.

Tom told him that what Hari was doing was called Chloromancy--Garden or Green Magic--and wasn't altogether surprised that it came easy to Hari. Tom went as far as to suggest that so might the other elemental magics, since Hari had such a large magical core. He did warn Hari that having a large core was not a get-out-of-studying-free card, as just because they came easily to him did not mean that he was naturally proficient. His grumbling made Hari smile to himself, mouthing after him outside his head where he knew Tom wouldn't be able to see.


'I can feel you mocking me.'


Hari laughed. It was the last time he would for a while, since Mrs. Nelson arrived at Number Four of Privet Drive the next morning.

Marjorie Nelson was imposing as before, with clothes a size or few too small stretched around her stout frame unflatteringly. She wielded her cane like a weapon, even giving Hari's door a good whack! as she passed it.

""Boy! Get my luggage!""

Inside, Hari flinched violently. He thought he would wait until she was a safe distance away to creep out, but Marge had other plans.

""Boy, get out here and get my luggage!""

Multiple thwacks hit against his door so hard Hari feared it would break. He slowly reached to push it open with shaky hands, but was too late as the door was ripped open and a furious Marge was revealed on the other side. Her face reddened much like how Vernon's did, and Hari could practically see the steam rising from her head. He was grateful that her short, large arms couldn't fit in his cupboard to grasp him--not that she didn't try.

Hari knew that it would only get worse if he didn't get out, but he also knew the moment he did Marge would grab him. He made a decision: using his magic to subtly push her arm just past him, he slipped around her and pressed himself against the opposite wall, chin tucked tightly against his chest.

He felt more than saw as she whipped around his direction, pushing her face into his and puffing hot, unpleasant breaths against Hari's cheeks. Marge seized his throat with her thick fingers.

""Listen here, boy,"" she hissed venomously, spittle flying from her lips, ""If you try to make a fool of me you'll be finding yourself sorely mistaken. I'll have Vernon throw you out faster than Ripper can tear through your legs. Now go--get--my--luggage.""

She threw him against the floor and stomped off, causing the floor and the walls to shake with each heavy step until she was safely away from the entrance room. Hari fought back the urge to groan when he forced himself up, choking back coughs and wheezes. He rubbed at his neck tenderly and tiptoed across to the door, careful not to make a noise in case it brought upon the wrath of another one of the elder Dursleys.

Parked outside in the driveway (right behind where Petunia's car would come out, Hari noticed) was Marge's silver BMW. He could see Ripper clawing at the front window, stepping over smaller bags to bark and snap at Hari. For now, Hari avoided the front and chose to unload the trunk. He would save the interior for last, to see if he could trick Ripper into the back yard before earning another bite mark on his leg.

It took him three trips, even with magic, to empty out the trunk. He decided to set them in a small pile beside the door in the entrance room, something he would probably be punished for later, but he didn't know which room Marge had insisted on taking and he certainly wasn't intent on asking. Before he took his chances with Ripper, Hari decided to put up a barrier between the front and back seats and stuff as many suitcases he could carry in his arms before slamming the door and dropping the charm. This process took four trips, and then it was time for Ripper.

Hari flattened himself out along the door and yanked it open, pulling himself up over the car door and onto the roof safely away from the dog that was currently in a mad frenzy. The white bulldog pounced along the car, leaving small scratch marks along the front side and the leather interior of the door, snapping at Hari and howling like a wild beast. Hari, in turn, eyed the gate at the very corner of the house and split himself off the hood. He ran like he was possessed, with Ripper hot on his heels, before slamming into the locked gate and screaming when he felt sharp teeth sink their way into his left leg. He forced the gate to open with his magic, practically causing the lock to explode, before kicking Ripper inside and tugging back his metal safety net. Ripper was whimpering and licking his paw, but Hari had little sympathy with his heavily bleeding leg. He twisted around to gauge the damage and breathed a sigh of relief when it was only somewhat deep. No skin was left hanging, and he could probably heal it quite easily later...or perhaps even now?

He had been using his magic quite a bit. Even though it wasn't enough to put much of a dent in it, but healing himself, especially forcing skin to grow back in such a short period of time, took a lot out of him. Hari decided to risk it. He channeled his magic into his leg, focussing on interweaving it into the areas that were currently oozing blood at an uncomfortable rate. He felt it begin to sting, and his skin begin to grow back, before he stopped, completely out of breath. When he looked back at it he saw that there were tiny scabs surrounding the area, but it hadn't healed much at all.

He tried again.

And again.

And again.

Four times, until he was sure it wouldn't work and spent the last of his magic forcing it to stay, holding his breath until he was red in the face. And finally, finally, the back of his leg was covered in infected-looking scabs that no longer bled. Well---he would deal with that later. Hari limped back to the car and finished unloading the front and, as expected, once inside he was ripped up by his throat again by Mrs. Nelson for leaving out her things.

He never noticed the small elf owl that sat perched in the tree of the front yard, watching him unblinkingly the whole time.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Marjorie had stayed until the second week of September. During that time, Hari walked on eggshells when he was allowed outside his cupboard and threw himself in harm's way when he saw Marge's rage begin to single in on one of the younger girls, or even, to Hari's surprise, Dudley. He didn't quite understand why he was protecting Dudley, especially when it often ended in said boy joining in on his punishment, but he could feel that the alternative to leave him was definitely not good.

He had been ripped up out of school, with the claim that Petunia was sick and she needed all the help she could get, and was left to fend for himself from Dudley's birthday till Marjorie left. Thanks to Marjorie, Hari had been gifted a pair of Vernon's old glasses. His stars had become more and more numerous, and Hari hadn't quite figured out how to make them go away completely, which resulted in him bumping into things and slamming into walls or doors that he nearly couldn't see. However, he had to be somewhat grateful, since the stars seemed to refract off of the glass within the frames just enough that Hari could make his way about in the unfocused world.

 The prescription made his eyes hurt and gave him horrible headaches, but Hari supposed it was better than nothing.

And now, with his new gift, Hari was being forced back to school. He would be a week late, with Petunia's illness that suddenly seemed to have afflicted her, and be forced into Mr. Osturbur's 5th year homeroom. Apparently Marge had specifically requested him since Mr. Osturbur dealt mainly with the delinquent children, and had no problem punishing as needed.

What was even better about him was that he was part of the expansion program. West Bridge had decided that they needed to split first through third year and fourth through sixth year into two separate buildings. Both Petunia and Hari were gleeful; Petunia would now no longer have to provide Hari a lunch, and Hari could attempt to sneak food from his classmates again.

Hari soon found out that Mr. Osturbur may have been even more vile than Marjorie Nelson herself. Apparently Officer Osturbur had been a high commanding officer in Her Majesty's Royal Army, and had chosen to retire many years ago. He told them believed in corporal punishment, and brought out a long, thin ruler-like instrument with small holes drilled through it and set it on his desk. Hari would learn exactly how Mr. Osturbur planned to use it.

Long sleeves were prohibited in class; either you rolled them up or wore a sleeveless shirt. Talking out of turn ended you with a single lash across the inside of your arm. Disrespect earned you three lashes. Bad grades earned you five. If you were unlucky enough to be picked out as an example, ten lashes would be delivered across your arms.

When he came back to the House with welted arms, the only sympathetic looks he gained were from Eunice, who was still too ashamed to talk to him. Vernon usually looked at him snidely when he caught glimpses of the harsh, red marks. Dudley had made it a habit to wrench Hari's arm by the wounds and use them to drag Hari around, particularly at the schoolyard to impress other children (particularly Piers Polkiss).

He had stopped temporarily after one particular oddity.

Dudley and his gang, consisting of Piers Polkiss, Michael Owens, and Zachary Dux, had been chasing Hari in their new game called Hari Hunting. The object of the game was to see who could catch Hari first. Whoever did got to either beat him up or throw him off of the top of the monkeys or the jungle-gym. 

Piers Polkiss was the thinnest of the lot--lanky and gangly and all limbs. He was blonde, had rat-like features, and fast. Hari had to push to be faster, usually running into another child or Michael.

Where Dudley was rather large in one way, Michael was large in the other. At eleven years old the redhead was more muscular than any of the children Hari had so far encountered. His favourite thing to do was to see how many times he had to stomp on Hari's arm before it would bleed.

Zachary was more or less the groupie of the gang. He was shorter than the other, not thin or large in any way, and not very fast. Usually he would just twist up his dog-face into a grin when one of the boys caught Hari, and try to join in then.

Yet out of all of his friends, Dudley seemed to be the one who caught him the most. Hari didn't think any of the others were holding back, since Dudley seemed to enjoy watching them beat up Hari as much as doing it himself. He even got a few licks in for good measure when he felt like it after the victor was done, if it wasn't him.

But Dudley would just...appear. He never seemed shocked, always waiting for Hari to realize he had just been chased into him, and never let Hari get away. He would be hiding in dark corners, or in the shade of trees, or even in groups of other children that Hari tried to hide in--just waiting. It scared Hari.

It had rained the week before and recess had been cancelled, much to Hari's relief. However, the head teachers thought it unfair to the children that they miss a whole week, and decided to extend recesses of the next week to cover lunch as well, so children could picnic outside. It was on the third day of Dudley's extended Hari Hunting session that it happened.

He was running into the middle of a group of children, desperate to hide if even for a moment. He knew he wouldn't get very long, since Piers was the one after him. But then, when Hari caught sight of the familiar too-sharp nose and malicious grin, Hari disappeared.

It felt like he had been hooked by another one of Vernon's fishhooks, this time behind his navel. It tugged him through a tube that felt like it was squishing Hari through a straw--overly suffocating and terribly claustrophobic. As it ended, Hari chanced a look around. There was no more grass, and he was sitting on something rather grainy and uncomfortable. It looked like a large, odd shape holding lots of crushed up rocks, with metal structures coming out of it like he had seen on some of the roofs in Little Whinging.

The roofs.

He was on the roof.

The middle of the roof, to be exact.

A small hoo? left Hari flinching, trying to find the direction of the noise. Almost directly behind him on his right was a small, golden-and-black owl. It's eyes were rather abnormally large even for an owl, and Hari thought that maybe he had shocked the poor thing.

'Flitwick?' Tom seemed rather shocked.


'Flitwick? What's a Flitwick?'


Tom seemed to think about how he should answer. 'It's him. He is an animagus--do not let him know that you know.'

Hari made a soft hum inside his head before gently reaching his hand out to the bird--well, the man-turned-bird. If he was to pretend that Flitwick really was an owl, then he supposed it was correct to treat him like one.

""Hey, it's okay--I didn't scare you did I?"" Hari put on his best remorseful look, which wasn't very difficult since he really did feel bad about scaring the owl. A soft hoo was his reply, along with a ruffle of feathers. Hari took that to mean no, or at least not too terribly.

Hari approached the bird with his hand out, keeping it at a low level in case his advances weren't welcome. Flitwick seemed to appraise his hand with a curious look, before dipping his head into the callused palm.


'I'm surprised he allowed you to touch him. If I recall correctly, he found the act of being pet demeaning. It's one of the reasons he and Minerva argue so much.'



'Minerva?'



'Another teacher. Her animagus is a cat. When students are--not in a good place--she transforms and allows herself to become a comfort animal.'



'How do you know this?'


Tom was silent, and Hari might have taken it for embarrassment if not for the icier feeling in his head. A small hoot redirected Hari's attention to Flitwick, and he gently scratched around the bird's feathers. He wondered if this was like preening. 

""Where did you come from, bird? I mean, owls don't really go out in the daytime,"" Hari asked. He didn't really expect an answer, but it was nice to use his voice again. Just as Hari thought, all he received was a ruffle of feathers that displaced his hand in reply.

Hari stayed with Flitwick for the rest of the school day before being fetched by one of the teachers whom had been looking for him.

""Will you be here tomorrow?"" Hari asked, anxious that the hope wasn't too obvious in his voice.

Flitwick looked at Hari, directly into his eyes, and dipped his head. Hari took that as a promise.

Three Headed Snake


(Or rather, Useful Information)


Flitwick had made good on his promise. He came nearly every day to visit Hari beginning in the library during the chilly season of late fall. During the first part of recess, Hari would slip out and sprint towards the double doors of the new Northwest Bridge Upper Elementary Library. Once inside, he would slink around to the smallest table in the darkest corner that he had made his niche. On his days without Flitwick, Hari would work on his basic education, even humouring when Tom gave him assignments. On his days with Flitwick, Hari would force open the locks of the windows so Flitwick could flutter inside, and he, in turn, would find a comfortable perch.

During their times together, Hari would grab books from all sections--the fourth year section, the fifth year section, the sixth year section, and even the gifted and talented section and read them aloud. He adopted the habit of reading aloud softly to the man-bird, thinking it rude if he simply ignored him the whole time. Flitwick never seemed to mind. If anything, Hari's voice lulled him to sleep.

Hari was never offended by this. In the beginning he may have been a bit perplexed at why the man was spending time with him when he was so tired, but Tom told him that Flitwick probably wasn't falling asleep on purpose.


'They're just getting over a war. He was a great part in the Light Resistance, and now is most certainly a great part in helping to rebuild.'



'The Light Resistance? He's a Dark Wizard?'



'I wouldn't be able to tell you if he was--and not all Dark Magia are evil. And no--the Light Resistance was the Resistance of the Dark, led by a mostly unanimously voted Light Leader to fight against the most recent English Dark Lord.'


So Hari was content to allow Flitwick to curl his beak to his fluffy chest and go to sleep. When he did, Hari would continue reading, just in case Flitwick woke. The only day he ever dared to wake Flitwick was when he was reading the Chronicles of Narnia and found a name that was safe to call Flitwick instead of simply 'hey you,' or 'bird.'

""Hey bird--wha'd'ya think of Glim?""

Flitwick merely fluffed his feathers and craned his head towards Hari.

Hari huffed. ""Well, it's better than just bird.""

Flitwick let out a small coo and clicked his beak together before beginning to preen under his wings. From then on, Hari referred to Flitwick as Glim. It made him feel like he had an actual friend instead of just talking to a bird.

During the late fall and early winter of 1990, Hari and now Glim stayed within the solitude of their corner, away from prying eyes. From September to November, Hari had read everything from Narnia to its fanfiction the Golden Compass. The first week of December, Hari had gone without reading anything. Instead, he spent his time doodling in the corners of books, which earned him a mental tirade from Tom and a three-quarter lidded glare from Glim.

""I've got to go home for Christmas, y'know."" Hari stated needlessly. ""I probably won't be back until half-January.....I'm usually not.""

He fit his chin into the crook between the flat of his palm and the heel of his hand and effectively ignored the hoots from the tiny owl. He told himself he only imagined how concerned they sounded.

""It's almost her birthday, y'know? Eunice?"" Hari had seldom spoke of Mildred and Eunice--only of the good times they had spent together. The small window they all three had together made for very few stories, but for very good memories.

""She's turning five. She's so big now...And Mildred! She's two  already. She said her first word--no. It was funny."" A sad smile graced his face. Hari didn't stop the tears that leaked from his eyes and plopped onto the rough sketches of three smiley-faced children below. His smile began to wobble when he heard the clicking of talons, and dropped completely into choking sobs when he felt soft feathers press close against him.

Hari missed the rest of class that day, and true to his word he was pulled early for Christmas break and didn't return till late January.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

This year, Eunice's birthday would now be carefully monitored by Petunia. Just days after the beginning of Christmas break Vernon had made her feel ashamed of herself for her failure of keeping Eunice away from it. He had screamed at her so loudly that Hari could feel his cupboard walls vibrating about how Petunia had entrusted Mildred within its care. The morning after, Petunia had come out with bruises around her neck and spotting around her arms. Vernon carried deep scratches that were attempted to be covered with gauze and bandages in much the same areas.

Naturally, Petunia blamed Hari. She had forced him to play her bathtub game again, and would come in at random intervals to dunk his head down under the water and hold it there. Every time he drew blood when he clawed at her hand, he was wretched up and slammed back against the floor of the tub. It took an hour and a half before she allowed him up, and Hari whispered out thank you thank you thank you until he noticed that his clothes and his glasses were nowhere to be found.

""Wh-where--where are my clothes, m-ma'am?"" Hari rarely ever directly addressed any of the elder Dursleys, but he was cold and the heat wasn't on in this part of the house, and he didn't dare use his magic when Petunia was so near.

Petunia didn't answer him. Instead she wrapped her bony fingers around his wrist and tugged him through the house. Hari wrapped his free arm around his shoulder and tried to warm himself up. It was a futile attempt, since Petunia threw him out the back door into the snow and slammed the sliding door shut.

Immediately Hari's shivering increased tenfold. His hands were planted on the deck through the snow that cradled up half his body. He knew he wouldn't last long, so he would have to risk it.


"":Zestos:.""


Warmth crept up through Hari's form from the inside out. The heating charm provided sweet relief from the cold nearly blanketing him and from the snow that was beginning to fall outside. Snow turned to mush around his body due to his body heat, yet Hari shivered still. He was still cold and he didn't understand why.

'A heating charm would hardly be adequate dry, with clothing. You are wet and naked.' Tom's voice was dry, but Hari could tell that he was concerned. Hari knew he was right; even when Hari covered with his clothes and cast heating charms on them the chill in his cupboard never quite left.

In Hari's eyes, he was left with one option. He focused on the stars in his vision til they spiderwebbed and the third eye opened up. Once again, he sought out the world of multi-coloured silks and her voice.


""Please--please I need help again.""


Instantly he could feel the consciousness of the silks turn to him. They wrapped around him like a gentle, large hand holding him, before releasing him to swirl just in front of his face.


""Oh child, my child, what have they done to you?""


Three, serpentine heads appeared from the silks--one a smooth, soft yellow with a small neck, one a larger, persimmon-coloured with round features, and the last a mix of the red-blacks that made Hari think of Tom's very first form.

""My child, my child, do not fret. Your time is almost done here."" The soft orange snake spoke with the voice of Hari's dreams--of Lily.

""What pain awaits you, but do not fret, my child. We are here. I am here."" The darkest one, Ms. Figg, seemed sad as she looked at him.

The third snake head only stared at him, swaying her head from side to side and dipping it in the direction she was going. She wasn't as clear as the other two; slightly opaque and cloud looking. Her tongue stuck out at him, at the ends of her mouth curled in a definitely un-reptilian smile.

""Is--is she--are you okay?"" Hari pointed towards the yellow snake. He had a feeling that they all were part of the same Goddess, so it made sense that the other two snakes--or pieces--would know.

A hissing laugh was his answer that seemed to resonate from around the yellow snake. ""You haven't met me yet, my child."" Her voice was velvet and dreamlike.

Hadn't met her yet? He was pretty sure that this was the second meeting of the Goddess...but then again, both voices seemed to have been people he knew...


""Who are you?""



""I am us, and we are the Mother.""


Hari huffed a bit, much to the giggling hisses of the snakes. 'That didn't really answer anything,' Hari thought, before remembering that Tom was not a part of him here. Before he could ask another question he was engulfed in a warm, white silk. The metaphysical chill that continued to cling to his body began to dissipate, and Hari could comfortably breathe without feeling like he had just sucked in ice.

""Thank you."" Hari lowered his gaze to his feet and tried to bow, feeling a bit ridiculous attempting it starkers.


""No need to thank me, my child. For you will suffer a great pain at the hands of your peoples, and at the hands of mine. I shall help you, just as you shall help me, my child, my Champion, my Priest.""


The snakes merged together into one great beast. It would have resembled a lizard, with the serpentine body and the four legs that formed from silks, if not for how large and thick they were. It looked more like a dog than a lizard, if Hari looked past the whip-like tail, the flat, snake-shaped head, and the glimmering scales that shone in all shades the three had, shining like fire. It almost looked like a dragon from the books Hari had read, only lacking the great wings and spikes.


""Now go, child. For I fear that if you do not wake in your world, you may forever find yourself in mine.""


The beast laid what served as the bridge of its muzzle against Hari's chest and gently pushed his out of the entrance world.

When Hari awoke, he was in a hospital, surrounded by people in white coats talking too fast for him to understand. He glanced to his sides and saw that his arms were hooked up to several machines, and that he was apparently tucked tightly into the hospital bed. He heard shrieking about how he's awake! but didn't take too much into it. Instead, he looked at the small face pressed against the glass door, leaving tear streaks and puffs of breath against it. Brown curls were the last thing he saw before he fell back into unconsciousness, but this time, thankfully, in his own world.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The first thing Hari thought of when he awake back in the hospital room was a word that Ms. Figg would not of approved of him knowing. The second thought that came to Hari's mind was how much trouble he was going to be in for drawing attention to himself, let alone medical attention. Hari didn't even want to think about what would happen when the Dursleys got the bill.

He groaned and felt a cool hand press against his forehead.

""--ri?"" He could barely make out the voice that trembled with the cool drops landing on his face. He felt a thumb wipe the wetness away, a dull, short nail catching on his cheek. It wasn't Petunia then; not that Hari thought it had been in the first place.

""Hari?"" The voice, definitely female, tried again. ""Hari, are you awake? How are you feeling, dear?""

Dear. Only one person called him that.

""M' Fi'?"" He tried to call out her name, but the words could barely form past his lips. He seemed correct in his assessment, at least, because more of what he assumed were tears dripped onto his face before being wiped away by a careful hand. The same hand that was running through his hair. Only Ms. Figg knew that Hari liked that.

""Yes, dear, it's Ms. Figg, I'm here,"" She hurried to assure him, alternating between whispering that he was going to be fine and that how dare the Dursleys leave him outside, despite what they told. At Hari's inquisition, Ms. Figg told him that apparently Petunia had left him out there for well over an hour. Eunice had been the one to call Ms. Figg from the Little Whinging's Phone Book, and Ms. Figg had called the paramedics. Petunia had caught Eunice on the phone and dragged Hari inside, wrapping him hurriedly in half-wet towels that had been soaked in hot water and throwing him in a spare bedroom. Her explanation to the paramedics included Hari throwing a tantrum, and a brief, ""accidental"" summary of his defiant behavior in both school and at Number Four.

Since the doctors had no reason to suspect child abuse, and had teachers to corroborate the Dursleys story, Hari was still entrusted in their care. The only way Ms. Figg had been allowed to visit was by threatening to tell the authorities the truth. When Hari asked why she hadn't in the first place, she merely told him that Dumbledore would overrule her and place him back. If anything, he would be in even more trouble for leaving. That bit had caused her great sniffles that didn't subside for several minutes, and Hari was unable to get anything else out of her for the rest of her visit.

She was his only visitor during his stay, which lasted from December 11th to the 16th. After he was discharged into the safe hands of the Dursleys, he was put immediately to work on Eunice's birthday. This year she wanted a horse theme. It made Hari feel happy knowing that he may have influenced why.

Replacing the pink ribbons of last year would now be braided ropes tied carefully into knots. Instead of sparkling, pink garlands there would now be horseshoes chained together and hung from the light fixtures. The goody bags were decorated as black ""villain"" and white ""sheriff"" cowboy hats, with oatmeal and chocolate chip treats inside. In place of pink velvet cake would now be something called derby cake--chocolate and whip cream and fruit all baked into one cake--in the shape of a large rectangle Hari was ordered to decorate like the races.

It wasn't as bad as last year, for now it meant something instead of Eunice trying to look like the animated lady on the telly. Hari still seethed when he thought about how Petunia had told Eunice that she wished Eunice looked more like the Barbie girl. But now there was no more needless making up. There was only happiness, and if a bit of sadness as well, for the memories that the horse theme brought to both Hari and Eunice's mind.

He was even ordered to set up the back yard for horse games, which would consist of the children riding stick horses over ""obstacle courses"" Hari swore Petunia designed just to make it harder. Stepping outside in the snow, even though he was clothed, set him back to nearly freezing to death. It took everything Hari had not to panic, forcing himself to walk out, start a fire in the firepit, and begin shoveling snow away. Every brush of harsh wind had him anxiously switching his gaze over to the sliding back door, forcing his magic to push it open just to make sure it wasn't locked.

He knew that this was light punishment, and was terrified of what could possibly be next. He wouldn't find out for a while.

While Eunice's birthday went off without a hitch, Hari was too busy worrying about what the Dursleys could have planned. Was he going to be frozen again? Put in the bath? Starved? Beaten? Possibilities swirled throughout his mind for days. On December 29th, Hari got his answer.

He had been locked in his cupboard straight from the moment he had finished preparing for Eunice's party. He wasn't to be let out, and once again relied on Tom to keep him healthy, less hungry, and somewhat clean. Then Petunia had unlocked his cupboard terrifyingly slow, the door creaking open to reveal her completely devoid of emotion. She wasn't angry, or snide, or even smiling that smile. Somehow, it scared Hari all the more.

She had crooked her finger at him, indicating Hari to follow her. Willessly, Hari obeyed. The walked to the kitchen, shocking a rather filthy Dudley, where Petunia had ordered Hari's shirt off. This confused Hari, since she usually hated seeing any part of him, let alone more of him. The puzzle pieces began to fit together when she turned on the top of the gas stove. Clutching his shirt to his chest, Hari began to back away. Petunia seemed unperturbed.

""You know,"" she began. ""I read the other day that a mother had put her child up on the stove for misbehaving. The papers called her all sorts of nasty names, but she was a brilliant woman. She got the brat to behave. I just don't see why you can't behave and be a good boy, darling.""

She turned, a sickening parody of a grin beginning to split her mouth. Dudley called out a soft, scared ""mum?"" only to be ignored. Small, blue-orange flames rose behind her and Hari knew he was in hell.

When his back hit the cool expanse of the fridge, Hari turned to bolt away. If he could run fast enough then maybe, just maybe, he could make it to Ms. Figg's without Petunia catching him. His hopes of escape shattered when he was caught by the arm before he could lift a foot in the other direction.

Petunia twisted his arm back behind his body and yanked him over to the stove. Hari could feel the flames beginning to lick at the baby-fine hairs along his arm and desperately jerked his body away. It only earned him a backhanded slap to the face and a rather vicious slamming of his arm onto the lit gas-plate of the stove.

Hari screamed. He screamed as he felt the flesh of his arms being pulled to tightly and burned away, crackling like shattered glass. When Petunia urged him further over the stove, Hari lashed out. His magic slammed against her, sending Petunia thrashing against the flames and Hari backwards against the tile.

If Hari had screamed, Petunia wailed. She flung herself back as soon as she could, but the damage was done. Her once shoulder-length, brown hair she had been so proud of was now sizzling at varying lengths and thicknesses around her ears. Her face that had been dyed from years of overused makeup was a shining red colour that looked raw, mimicked in patterns across her neck and arms.

Tears streamed down the two children's faces, both for different reasons. As Hari tried to muffle his cries, Dudley openly sobbed and sought along the kitchen counter for the home phone. The two youngest Dursley children came running into the kitchen, shrieking at the bodies on the floor. While Mildred sat and began bawling, Eunice ran over to Hari and fisted her tiny hands in the material of his pants, begging him to be okay. Blue light ran over Hari's burns, soft and new, and began to shakily repair the damage that had been done.

Hari merely let a few more tears leak out. This was his punishment for being in the hospital, what was going to happen now that he had sent Petunia to the hospital?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Turns out, nothing would be done to Hari now that Petunia was in the hospital. Doctors had obviously become suspicious when Hari came back with second degree burns along his right arm, especially when Petunia had come along with varying degree burns in a number of places. So, Hari was to be removed to a foster home for a few months until Child Services could verify that the Dursley's were either abusive or Hari was simply a delinquent.

Once again, Ms. Figg had been the very first visitor in Hari's room, apart now from Eunice and Mildred when they could sneak in and from Hari's caseworker. She had offered to become Hari's foster mother, and a tearful Hari told her that he would love to have Ms. Figg as a mother. Ms. Figg hadn't corrected him.

That was how a rather determined Ms. Figg waltzed up to Hari's caseworker and demanded that she be given the information on how to become a foster mother; specifically Hari's foster mother. Hari's caseworker, a rather tall lady with long, black hair named Jamie Kent, had practically interrogated Ms. Figg about her motives. When Hari had assured Mrs. Kent about Ms. Figg with a tiny bit of persuasion magic, Mrs. Kent said that she would see if she could pull a few strings since Miss Arabella was such a competent caretaker.

Less than two weeks later, one Arabella Urial Figgueroa was given custody was one Hari James Potter.

Hari had been simultaneously filled with excitement and anxiety at the prospect of moving in with Ms. Figg. His room had been left mostly the same, with the cot being taken out and replaced with a small, horizontal bookshelf. He had been pleasantly surprised to find that most of the books on the shelf were magical, a mix of educational and children's picture books. His desk had been replaced with a larger one, complete with a mini shelving and drawer unit that Hari felt slightly guilty about having. Really, Hari felt guilty about having everything in the room--it had to of cost Ms. Figg a lot of money, and Hari didn't have near enough to pay her back. So, Hari asked her what was expected of him to pay off his debt.

""Whatever do you mean, dear?"" Ms. Figg seemed rather confused, more so than Hari felt.

""My debt, Ms. Figg, for making you spend money on me.""

Ms. Figg seemed to gain a sudden click of clarity. ""Well, I suppose if you wanted to, you could let me be your teacher?""

""My teacher?"" Hari blinked owlishly.

Ms. Figg only smiled. ""Yes, your teacher. You see, I haven't had a child to care for--long term,"" she gave a rather pointed look at Hari. ""In quite a while. Cristiano was our--my--only son, and he was.....before.....He never got to have children."" 

Ms. Figg sniffled. Hari patted her hand. He knew it was hard for her to talk about her son and what happened.

""Of course! I would love to learn from you, Ms. Figg."" Hari rushed out, linking their fingers together.

""You may call me Arabella, or whatever you please, Hari."" She smiled at him. ""Now, I happen to know that your closet is dreadfully empty, so what do you say about going on a little trip?""

Despite Hari's quiet protests, Ms. Figg had led him to her purple Audi Quattro and even let him sit in the front. She drove him to South Wright Square and they spent the rest of the day visiting various outlet malls located there. By the time they returned, Ms. Figg's trunk, backseat, and even the foot space under Hari was full of bulging bags of clothes, shoes, and school supplies. She had helped him hang them up and sort through his shoes, and presented him with a brand new backpack that she encouraged him to take to school on Monday.

For the first time in a long while, Hari went to school excited. He began excelling in his classes, despite his still-healing injury, and met up with Glim in the library for reading sessions during their usual times. Even Dudley and his gang were leaving him alone, and Hari felt fantastic. He was gaining weight by being allowed to eat as much as he wanted during meal times, and no longer felt constantly light headed or sick to his stomach.

He finished school with high Cs, and even a few low Bs, Something he had shamefully presented to Ms. Figg. She had merely smiled her smile at him and told him that he must be extremely smart to have pulled up his grades so high in such a small amount of time. She had a way of making Hari feel proud of himself and forget that he ""shouldn't be"". On the first Sunday of summer break Ms. Figg burst into his room at an hour she usually claimed was simply ungodly, announcing that they were to go to on a very special visit that day.

She helped Hari pick out an appropriate outfit and brushed his tangled hair into a somewhat manageable mane that brushed his shoulders. She had also baked, for some unknown reason. When Hari inquired about the small cookies and treats, she simply smiled--not her smile--at them.

""We're going to the Wizarding world today, to visit my son.""

Cristiano. From what Hari had been told and had gathered himself, Cristiano was a permanent resident of St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, and had no hope of recovering.

""I also thought we may stop by at Diagon Alley, to get you a few trinkets.""

Diagon Alley. He had heard of it from Tom, and the off-handed mentionings from Ms. Figg. It was supposed to be one of the branches of the main English Wizarding community, serving mostly as a school supply shopping outlet with the odd toystore here and there. It was served as only one of many alleys that tied to Akadem Alley, or Akadem Central, which Ms. Figg said held the British Wizarding Ministry. Had thought that must have made it rather important, but Tom laughed in his head and made snide comments about how something called Gringotts and Ollivanders were more important on their own than the entirety of the Ministry put together.

All the talk of magical Alleys and this magic shop or that one had Hari very excited at the prospect of how exactly they would get there. All sorts of ideas ran through his mind--from flying like Mary Poppins to riding a dragon! He was very confused when instead, Ms. Figg simply pulled out her very purple car and encouraged him to get in.

Thus, now that Hari's daydreams of riding a dragon had been inadvertently crushed, Hari began new daydreams. Ones that involved flying cars to teleporting cars to even cars that went faster than Hari could see! He wondered what they would arrive at--maybe a castle! Like Hogwarts, or maybe a dragon's keep! Or maybe they would find a secret, underground club of witches and wizards--

They were at a gardening store. A simple, redbrick department store that looked as if it had seen better days. The faded, peeling label on top labeled it Sun Stop, and under the lime green awning was a bubbly young woman greeting people and switching which doors she was opening for them.

Ms. Figg grasped his hand and led him over to the practically bouncing brunette.

""Ms. Figg, welcome back! How can we help you today?""

She wore a shiny badge that switched between a plough crossing a strange looking plant and a long, thin stick crossing a bone when the sun caught off of it. Ms. Figg smiled at her and pulled her into a hug, which the girl accepted.

""Thank you, Ms. Tuckett; what am I ever here for? Though I suppose a garden would be nice..."" Ms. Figg trailed off in thought, releasing Ms. Tuckett. Ms. Tuckett giggled and pulled a silver pin from her pocket, fastening it on Ms. Figg's collar.

""Of course, Cristiano will be delighted to see you. I heard he was transferred to the South Wing, so he must be doing better!"" The tiny woman gave an encouraging grin to the duo and turned her attentions on Hari, ""And who's this little cutiepie?""

Before Ms. Figg could answer, Hari gave a shy smile and piped up. ""My name is Hari Potter, ma'am.""

He watched Ms. Tuckett's smile curve down and fall, her entire face curling in on itself in barely-hidden disgust. ""Oh...Potter... "" She knew which Potter. Everyone knew which Potter Hari was. The son of the high-ranking Death Eater, James Potter, who betrayed the Light and got over two-hundred people killed, including his own wife and the wife of one of his best friends.

She deposited another silver pin into Ms. Figg's hand and dutifully ignored the small boy, even under the disapproving glare of Ms. Figg. The younger woman simply sniffed disdainfully when the elder woman clipped the pin to Hari's soft blue button up. Ms. Figg slid her hand into Hari's and tugged him along through the left door, which was not being held open for them, he noticed. Though Hari didn't pay too much attention to Ms. Tuckett once they were inside, because even though the outside was a crumbling, peeling chain-link store, the inside was truly magical.

Luminescent, pale lavender tiles covered the floors with deep violet-red wallpaper across the walls that could be seen. There were cherry-wood arches and furniture, covered with, and accentuated by, long drapes of a strange looking sage that Hari had never seen before. Pots of lavender hung from the ceilings, sat on the floor, and stayed suspended against the walls, the scent thick in the air. In place of electric lights were large windows that had different sceneries playing out in each one--a Saharan desert, a Brazilian rainforest, an Arctic penguin group, and an underwater waterfall. Next to each window was a strange, green-copper looking dial, each arrow pointing at what Hari thought could be a different station, like a Muggle radio.

And the people. Witches and Wizards ran around in robes of varying shades of vibrant greens with lavender or grey-white undertones. Shouts of Healer so-and-so! and Mediwizard! or Mediwitch! so-and-so, and Hari marveled at the hustle of the hospital.

Ms. Figg tugged him into a large elevator, something Hari wouldn't have expected in a magical building, and pressed the number 5. Before the door shut, two more people got on in lime green robes. Ms. Figg told him that they were full-fledged Healers. She wrapped her arm around him and used the other to hold a hardy grip on the handle on the wall, and Hari only understood why when they lurched off at a speed that made Hari's stomach drop.









The male Healer got off at the third floor, the elevator shooting forward to the North Wing, and then backwards and to the left before returning on it's dizzying speed upwards. Ms. Figg and Hari were deposited in the West Wing Entrance and barely had enough time to step out of what Hari classified as a death trap before it shot off again, the lady inside looking completely unperturbed.









The fifth floor was quite different than the first; instead of tile that reminded Hari of light purple starbursts, there was deep red hardwood. Replacing the near maroon colour of the walls was a very muted tea-brown that made Hari feel very calm, especially with the same lavender plants potted along the floor. Along with them sat several other plants that Hari had no names for, but came in a variety of dazzling shades that made Hari's eyes sparkle.









""This way, deary,"" Ms. Figg tittered,tugging him back along a hallway behind the elevator. Her heels clicked along the wood in tandem with the Mediwitches' and wizards' on the floor, something that grated on Hari's sensitive ears. They eventually came to a sort of lobby, complete with plush couches on top of a very soft-looking rug, and dozens of fireplaces lining the walls. Hari thought that maybe they had a bit too many fire pits, until he witnessed Magia popping out of them, followed by puffs of green fire.









'They're flooing. The Floo is a wizarding transportation system setup in fireplaces. Quite messy if you ask me.' Tom sniffed out a 'hmph' at the sight of people banishing soot and ash from their clothing. Hari thought of the day he found Ms. Figg in such a state, and wondered if that was what she had been doing herself.









""Ms. Figg?"" He tugged gently on her hand when they rounded the corner to Hallway 8-F. She let out a small hum and Hari decided it was safe to continue with his questions; after all, Ms. Figg hadn't ever punished him before. ""Why didn't we come out of the fireplace?"" He didn't think he should mention the world floo, since his foster mother would then wonder where he got it from, and Hari didn't particularly feel like lying to her.









""The firepla--oh! You mean the floo, darling."" Hari struggled not to flinch at the endearment, worrying the skin of his cheek between his teeth. ""You can only floo one at a time, and--well with your family's reputation and your own inexperience, I didn't want to risk you getting lost."" She pretended not to see Hari's face fall, but she did slip her hand out from his and wrap her arm around his small shoulders instead.









It didn't take long after for them to reach a plain, red wooden door marked Figgueroa. Ms. Figg drew in a deep breath and turned a watery smile to Hari.









""Now, I--I know it'll--it'll be shocking for you to see--well for you to see him. He can't help it.""









Hari squared his shoulders, but it wasn't enough for what met him inside. He had expected Cristiano to of looked normal, just been mentally unable to take care of himself, or perhaps be in a coma. This was not so. Pacing across the room was a strange, monstrous creature that looked half burned and half rotten. Permanently purpling lay on unnaturally green-brown skin that was stretched too tight over a skeletal figure, rising and falling with crude surgical-looking scars all over what body it had.










This was Cristiano.










It--he--turned to them, and Hari backed away behind Ms. Figg's skirt. Cristiano only had one arm, his left, with barely any fingers left. Those that resided were in bits and pieces. His right side didn't even have a shoulder--a large dip curving his body where the appendage and much more was obviously missing. His lips and nose were gone, and his eyes were a milky white that Hari would have attributed to blindness if not for the way that Cristiano seemed acutely aware of where everyone and everything stood in the room.

""Meu filho, look at you! Walking all by yourself!"" Ms. Figg seemed proud and sad at the same time, and urged Hari to sit in one of the visitor's chairs with her. Cristiano sat too, on his bed, curled up in the corner with his knees drawn to his chest. Hari found this to be very familiar to him, and realized why; Hari adopted this look when he was afraid. Then another light bulb went off--Cristiano was afraid. Cristiano was afraid of Hari. 

""Meu filho, I brought you a friend. This is Hari, and he's very excited to meet you.""

Cristiano let out what should have been a low keening noise, but came out raspy and broken. Hari reached out with his magic, and was surprised when he was hit full front with an onslaught of 'Medo--medo--medomedomedo.' 

Hari thought Tom was the only one who could talk inside Hari's head.

'Legilimency makes it easier to gain access to someone's thoughts. Especially someone who is apparently a Legilimens as well. It becomes a sort of telepathy.' Tom actually seemed impressed that Cristiano could react with Hari's magic in such a way. 'You could see if he's coherent, if you wanted.' Tom tried to shrug it off, but Hari knew that it was a suggestion that would most likely benefit the three physical beings in the room.

Hari reached out again to Cristiano. His magic had a shattered feeling. Like a puzzle that had been scattered with too many pieces lost.


'Cristiano, can you hear me?'


Hari felt shock through the temporary bond, laced with the tiniest tinge of hope.


'Who who who who who?'


The same echoes rang throughout his mind, repeating upon themselves and grating through Hari's ears. Ms. Figg didn't seem to notice a change in her son's demeanour, simply pulled out the cookies from her bag and began pulling the plastic wrap off of them.


'I'm Hari.'


All the shards of Cristiano's magic aimed themselves at Hari, and even Ms. Figg noticed when Cristiano began attempted to scream. His hand tried to claw along the bumps of his head as cracked, hoarse noises came from his mouth. His mind filled with tangles of Potter and getoutgetoutgetout, thoughts knotting themselves together with the pain that racked his body. Hari knew it probably was a bad idea to reach out and touch Cristiano, so he did the next best thing. Hari sent out healing magic, magic full of memories, and magic meant to calm Cristiano.

The effect was almost instant. His hand came down from trying to scratch at his head, the pained near-silent screams subsided, and Cristiano stopped rocking. He started humming. It was difficult for him, without proper lips, but sure enough small buzzes that resembled music came from where they would have been.


'I'm here with your Mum. She...she misses you.'


Ms. Figg was crying, petting the blankets near her son, to hesitant to reach out to him in case he lashed out.


'Mamae?'


Cristiano had the ability to recognize that people were in his room, but had no ability to associate who they were based on his memories of before his injury. So, while he could somewhat remember his mother, he hadn't known it was her that was visiting him; only that the same woman visited him mostly the same days at the same time. At the mention of his mother, his white eyes began to water, and Ms. Figg began sobbing hopelessly. She couldn't understand what was wrong.


'Eu amo mamae.'


Hari had a feeling that that probably meant something along the lines of I love you, and desperately wanted to tell Ms. Figg. But telling her would mean revealing that he had been communicating with Cristiano...and telling her how he had known to do so...

But she sounded so sad.

""Ms--Ms. Figg?""

If she heard him, she made no indications. Tears rolled down her face as she clutched the covers around her son, whispering in the language Cristiano spoke and Hari didn't understand.

""Ms. Figg? Cristiano--um--he says that--he says he loves you.""

Ms. Figg's gaze snapped up to him. ""Don't you dare, Hari. Don't you dare say something like that--especially like that--to me.""

""N-no really, Ms. Figg--""

""How dare you--""

""He called you mamae? Eu amo mamae?""

Ms. Figg stopped. Large, pregnant tears rolled slowly down her face. Hari didn't know Portuguese. There was no possible way for him to know Portuguese, despite the mangled mispronunciation....So that meant--that meant.....

She let out a great sob and risked grasping her son's hand. Cristiano flinched heavily, but allowed himself to be pulled up into his mother's arms. The same phrase kept repeating in his head, even as unintelligible gurgles spilled from his mouth. His own hand searched wildly until it found Hari's smaller one, and Cristiano held tightly. No words needed to be exchanged between the trio--Hari knew what it meant.

Hari and Ms. Figg didn't quite make it to Diagon Alley that day. However, Hari had found something better than a magical toy or trinket;

Hari had found a brother.

A Will and a Way


(or rather, To the Cupboard Under the Stairs)


Hari's eleventh summer had been bittersweet. After his revelation with Cristiano's only means of communication, Ms. Figg had gone straight to the lead Healer and requested a MindMender. She claimed that her nephew Hari was an accidental Legilimens, and that he had stumbled into Cristiano's mind. It wasn't exactly a common practice, but it wasn't impossible either. The only problem was that Legilimens MindMenders were hard to come by in English wizarding community after their war, and none were too keen on portkeying out to the United Kingdom.

Cristiano's healing was put on hold until they could find someone qualified for his particular situation with enough time to dedicate to the patient. It would be a long wait, but Hari and Ms. Figg had hope.

Even with Cristiano's new means of communication, he was still wary of talking too long with Hari. He swapped between short, choppy sentences that gave Hari the impression he was hyper-paranoid, and forgetting who Hari was (aside from the fact he was most definitely a Potter), and screaming for the near entirety of Hari and Ms. Figg's visits.













The latter times were becoming less and less as Ms. Figg took Hari along to visit Cristiano more frequently, for as long as the Mediwitches would allow them to stay. Hari made an attempt to seep some of his magic into Cristiano's mind, beginning to fill in the cracks of what use to hold it together. He hadn't felt that he made much progress in the few weeks he had been able to access Cristiano's mind, it was becoming more obvious in the way he began conversing, and reached out to take hold of his mother's hand each time she entered.













Hari held out hopes that soon he could make Cristiano's constant shiverings cease, and perhaps then he could write.







Currently he was laying in his bed, waiting for Ms. Figg to reappear from the fireplace, conversing exactly how to go about mending a mind with Tom.







'There shouldn't be any pieces ""missing"", as you say, merely buried in the subconscious. You won't be able to dig them out with your level of Legilimency yet, at least not without driving yourself completely insane, or forcing Mr. Figgueroa into an emptier shell than what he was.' 







Well, that was.....most of his options off the table, really. Hari didn't necessarily like forcing his way into other's heads, especially when it was easy, but he knew the boon outweighed the moral consequences.













However, if he couldn't simply force the pieces back into place, how was he supposed to heal Cristiano?













A mental tongue flicked against the inside of his brow. 'If you continue as you are, little by little, some will eventually return on their own. Some are better remaining gone.'







Hari huffed and buried his face into the soft mismatched pillows that littered his bed. Ms. Figg had early on discovered Hari's affection for fluffy pillows and soft blankets, and had begun swarming him with them, much to his own embarrassment.













'Either way, you shouldn't be focusing on such matters. Today is a special day, is it not?' Tom's voice turned proud, soft scales expanding out to 'hug' Hari.













He was right--today Hari was eleven, and more excited than he had ever been. Tom had been telling him tales of Hogwarts, and how Hari was sure to receive his letter at midnight.  Surprisingly, Tom had even regaled Hari with stories of his own Hogwarts letter and his time there (mostly about idiotic students and incompetent teachers, and how he didn't expect Dumbledore to be any better judge of character than Tom's own Headmaster, Armando Dippet).













'Dumbledore was the reason I was allowed to come to power, you know.' 













It still disturbed Hari to think of his Tom being one with the Dark Lord Voldemort, and had said so on an occasion. All that had earned him was a lecture on how disassociating the two would cause Hari more harm than anything. That it was important Hari remember that Tom was Voldemort, but no longer is, instead of imagining the two as different entities.













'Um, how?' 













'I released a juvenile Basilisk into the plumbing system.' He said matter-of-factly, as if that was supposed to make any sense to Hari.














    'A....a what?'














'A Basilisk. They're magical creatures that resemble snakes. They're able to understand parseltongue, so it was fairly easy to control it.' 













    And again, Hari had more questions than answers. He wasn't incompetent, he figured if a Basilisk was a great snake and Tom could speak to it like Hari spoke to him and to the garden snakes, then Parseltongue must be the language they spoke.













'Dumbledore had been suspicious of me from the minute we met, and I'm fairly sure he knew I was breeding Basilisks. He never went to the headmaster, however, and a classmate of mine died as a result. I believe she's still there.' His tongue flicked out absently, as if the thought had just occurred to him. At least he sounded ashamed.














    'And he never....did anything?'














'I suppose he tried, but in the end I managed to pin the blame on another classmate of mine. It was fairly easy, since he was half-giant with a history of smuggling in dangerous creatures. It....I hadn't released her on purpose, and I wish it hadn't ended up being Rubeus who took the blame.' 













'A half-giant?' In passing, Tom had mentioned magical beings Hari could only recognize form the footnotes in Ms. Figg's textbooks. Despite them being more-or-less human, Hari had been under the impression that they couldn't.....well.....have children with others outside their race.













    'Rubeus Hagrid. We were something akin to.....friends in my time. Views upon magical non-humans and half-humans were barbaric at best.' 













'Barbaric?' 













    Hari could feel the swell of magic against the forefront of his mind, the telltale sign that Tom was about to show him something, before they were interrupted by the choking poofs of the floo. Normally, it wouldn't of worried Hari since he was expecting Ms. Figg to arrive much the same way she had left. It wouldn't of worried Hari if he hadn't of heard more than a handful of sputters from the fireplace, and more than one set of feet against Ms. Figg's tile.














    ""Ouh! I can't wait to meet the little bugger!""














""Nymphadora!"" 













""Don't call me--"" 







    He recognized Ms. Figg's voice, but the other, higher-pitch mingled with at least three other sets of voices, trying not to shout over the continued floo noises. Panic settled in, his muscles clenching and his hand grasping at the blankets underneath him. There wasn't a window in the room, but Hari knew that if he wanted to he could force his way out.






















    ""Now, now! You'll scare the poor dear!"" 






















That voice reminded him of Ms. Figg, but it sounded heavier and deeper, like the librarian from his school.






















    ""You all finish setting up and I'll go get him.""






















    It was of little comfort to hear Ms. Figg again when there were so many strangers in the house. Would she keep him safe?





















    Of course she would.  





















He felt a bit ashamed of himself thinking otherwise, but didn't have long before her footsteps were outside his door and his door was knocked on and creaking open. All the tension melted from his body the minute he spotted her, leaving confusion in his wake. Usually Ms. Figg wore loose shirts and long-flowing skirts and the godforsaken sandals Hari couldn't bring himself to tell Ms. Figg he hated when she asked him about them. Instead, she was wearing a beautiful honey-gold pantsuit and brown flats that had tiny heels. She had done up her makeup like she did when she took Hari out, and had curled her hair and allowed it to fall freely around her shoulders.





















""Happy birthday, dearie. I've got a bit of a surprise for you outside, but I'm afraid you're going to have to get dressed first."" Her tone was teasing and she smiled at the way Hari suddenly seemed very shy in his pajamas.





















""I--I don't know what to wear.""





















""Don't fret, I'll help you pick something out."" She sounded entirely too excited about something for Hari's comfort as she walked over to his dresser drawers and began rifling through the button-ups she had insisted on buying him. She settled on a soft teal shirt with black slacks and waived off his question about shoes. ""You won't have to worry about that until tomorrow, darling. Mediwitch Orping said we may be able to bring Cristiano home for a teeny bit, as long as she can come.""













Hari plucked right up, just as she suspected, and she gave him one last gentle smile before allowing him his privacy.













'This is the best birthday ever.' Hari thought to himself. He wasn't expecting a reply, but the soft I agree from Tom made it all the more special.













When he finished dressing he slowly creaked his door open, still apprehensive of the voices coming from the kitchen. He rounded the corner and almost blanched at how many people were there.













""Wotcher Hari!""













Ah, so that was Nymphadora. He thought the odd name quite fit with her electric bubblegum hair that seemed to tangle even worse than his own. Wisely, he kept any comment about it to himself.













""Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.""













And that was the not-Ms. Figg.













""I'm Amelia Bones, and I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.""













She outstretched her hand and Hari was unsure if he was allowed to touch her, or if there was a special protocol he was supposed to follow. Did he have to kiss her hand? He did so just in case, making sure not to grasp to hard to let his own hand or mouth linger where they could be severely unwanted. He thought he had made a mistake when her face dusted pink and she began choking.













""Well! Isn't he a little gentleman! Much more so than our son, I'll say, eh Milly, dear?""













Another woman wrapped her arms around Mrs. Bones' waist, who turned to her and began trying to smother her own laughter in the new woman's shoulder.













""You'll have to forgive my wife, I fear you may have just swept her off her feet! You'll have to forgive me as well, for I may be a teensy-bit jealous."" The new woman (the other Mrs. Bones?) seemed to be attempting very hard not to burst into giggles. She was a sight next to her wife--wild, long blonde hair and sparkling green eyes with delicate pale skin contrasted with Ms. Amelia's dark brown hair that was pulled tightly up on her head and tanned skin that shown small scars where Hari could see. Her voice was also softer, and reminded Hari more of Lily while Ms. Amelia mirrored Ms. Figg. He decided he quite like the Mrs. Bones'.













""Oh dear, I haven't even introduced myself! I'm Belladonna, call me Donna please,  and this is our son Olivar, and our niece Susan.""













She pushed forward two children that seemed to be around Hari's age, a girl with fiery-red hair that reminded Hari of a fox, and a boy that seemed to be a carbon copy of Ms. Donna if she had whacked all her hair off. Hari gently took their hands one at a time, and simply shook them now that he knew it was fine. The redhead--Susan, Hari assumed--pulled an offended face when he had shaken his, however.













""I suppose my aunt is the only lady present?""













When Hari's face turned stricken she immediately lit up like the Yule lights Hari had always loved and began giggling madly, rivaling her aunt.













""You hardly qualify as a lady. The crushed bit of that beetle I found on my shoe, maybe.""













""Oh shut up Olivar!""













""Children, stop fighting this instant."" Ms. Amelia seemed to of recovered, but despite her no-nonsense tone that had the two bucking up, her face threatened to break out into another grin.













""Well, if you'll excuse my behavior, I'm Amelia Bones, as you know, and you may call me Amelia. This is my apprentice, Nymph--""













""Don't call me Nymphadora!"" To Hari's surprise, the bubblegum pink hair the woman had previously been sporting seemed to boil into a deep red that seemed to steam. She leveled a rather impressive glare to a rather unimpressed Ms. Amelia, before her hair bubbled back to electric pink and she seized Hari's hand herself. With the way she started accosting his hand, Hari thought he may be lucky to have one left after she was finished.













""I'm Tonks."" She put special emphasis on the name and for a moment Hari was terrified if she had been able to read his mind earlier. ""Number-one auror trainee, top of my field, gold star, absolutely at your service at any time!"" She began prattling off ranks and terms and stories that Hari didn't even half-understand before she was gently nudged aside by a somewhat exasperated-looking Ms. Figg.













""Well, now that you've met everyone, perhaps we should have lunch? I had hoped to go out, but I'm afraid I don't know what you like best."" She seemed a bit upset at the prospect, and Hari hurried to reassure her.













""Don't worry, Ms. Figg, I don't think any place in the whole wide world could beat your cooking.""













At the sight of her teary eyes, he was terrified he had said something wrong until a large smile broke out of her face and Ms. Donna's laughter rang throughout the house.













""Yes, well, Let's eat then, hmm?""













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













It could certainly be said that while Hari was a bit biased towards Ms. Figg's cooking, he most definitely wasn't wrong. She had prepared a large meal fit for an entire army of guests, having a large magical creature Hari felt a bit guilty that he didn't know the name of for the main course, with sides of both muggle and magical origins.









He had also learned that Susan was currently twelve versus Olivar's ten, and that they were both ecstatic to have someone right in the middle. While they were cousins, Hari believed they couldn't of been closer if they had been born siblings. They bickered over absolutely everything, and much to Hari's amusement (and everyone else's chargin), had roped Tonks into over half off their arguments, with at least one starting a sneak food-fight. That one had ended rather abruptly at Ms. Figg's threats of withholding cake, along with one Susan covered in some sort of rice and bean paste, one Olivar doused in sparkling grape cider, and one Hari covered face-first into what had looked and felt like a pie, and Tonks with what could have been a broken nose.















Ms. Figg had then brought out the cake after Ms. Donna had hastily spelled away the mess while Ms. Amelia spelled Tonks' nose clean and healed, all because A--Ms. Figg was nearly in hysterics over her kitchen floor, and B--Tonks had begun to raise her wand to try to clean. It was a tall, white cake decorated with coconut shavings and dried fruits, with a duo of sizzling 1's atop it that changed colour every time they sparked.













It was one of the best things Hari had ever seen (maybe only slightly beat by waking up to Ms. Figg making him breakfast).













They all sang Happy Birthday to him, albeit the newly dubbed trio of terror all chimed in with disasterfully different versions that each had Hari cackling.













And while Hari was more than grateful for the food, and the cake, and especially the company, he couldn't imagine that they had gotten him presents.













Ms.' Donna and Amelia had gotten him the books he would need at Hogwarts, and Ms. Amelia had waived it off when Hari protested and tried to give them back because it's too much! You shouldn't spend so much on me! 













""We got a discount either way! A bundle so we could get Olivar's as well, even if it is a tad early.""













Susan and Olivar had turned in fistfulls of their pocket money to buy him a small basket full of sweets from a shop called Honeydukes, and Susan shrugged at the But you shouldn't of--that was aimed at her.













""Hey, as long as you admit Hufflepuff is the superior house, we're cool.""













Hari nodded despite Olivar's protests that Gryffindor was the best, and Tom's mental Gryffidiot.













Tonks had gotten him a small pouch that he didn't see the point of but was thankful for anyway, until she stuck her entire arm into the pouch and pulled out several objects that Hari was positive were much too large to fit into it. The things she pulled out were met with a highly disapproving Ms. Figg, who was assured that Hari wasn't interested in that pranking nonsense, thankyouverymuch! Which tonks had retaliated with a smart But he has a legacy to live up to! 













The room went tense and silent for a moment, with Tonks' hair turning a more pastel pink that matched the flushing of her face when she realized what she had said. Susan was the one to break the silence, thankfully.













""Well, I dunno. The marauders mostly got caught didn't they? I know it's a quick assumption, but I don't think Hari's that much of a Gryffindork--I mean idiot. Well, same thing really.""













That had started a ""House Pride"" war that seemed to even stretch to Ms. Figg, who was adamant that Ravenclaw had the highest hand, and the Mrs.' Bones teasing each other over Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff.













It had finally settled down when Hari had thanked everyone a bit loudly, which put Ms. Figg in a burst of embarrassment.













""Oh dear! I almost forgot my gift to you, darling!""













Once again, Hari's stuttered protests were ignored as Ms. Figg rushed through the living room into her bedroom. He didn't think he could imagine a better gift than this--than anything he'd been given by his new friends and everything Ms. Figg had ever done for him.













Ms. Figg's gift was an emotional one.













She returned holding a plain, manilla envelope with a few coloured paper clips peeking out of the side. She sat down on her weathered couch beside Hari and gently placed the folder onto his lap. He gently lifted the edge of the folder to reveal a bunch of papers covered in legalese he couldn't begin to hope to understand.













""Ms. Figg--um, I don't--""













""They're adoption papers, Hari.""













Everyone held their breath. You could of heard a pin drop to the floor. Hari stared at the papers, uncomprehending, his eyes beginning to water.













""I know I can't replace Lily, but, I--I want to be your mother, Hari. I--""













""You already are."" His voice was hoarse and he swore he could hear Ms. Amelia shushing a tearful Ms. Donna. Tonks was unabashedly blowing her nose, and subsequently being elbowed by a sniffling Susan.













""You--you've done more for me--You've taken care--You--Ms. Figg--""













Hari could no longer form a coherent sentence. His breaths became drowned out by his sobbs and he desperately flung himself at her, absently noting the soft drips he could feel falling in his hair. He could feel Tom in his head, mimicking a sensation that felt like Ms. Figg's fingers running through his hair.













""W-well then,"" she sniffled, and brought a hanky to her nose, ""I suppose it would be rather improper to keep addressing me as Ms. Figg, now wouldn't it?""













Hari huffed out a quiet, watery laugh and tried to recall the pronunciation he heard now multiple times a week.













""I--I suppo-pose so, Mamae.""







The others clapped for him and he was hugged tightly by each guest, with blessings and well wishes and whispers of congratulations! 













The rest of the afternoon was spent a tiny bit tearfully, with a foreign warmness to the house that Hari hoped never left.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













The excitement of the day gave Hari a guaranteed easy passage into sleep. However, he was not eased into dreams.













He was inside his mindscape again, only he couldn't sense Tom, so he knew he must be asleep.













    'But how can I be here and be asleep? Tom was with me all the other times.....' 













Hari rubbed at his eyes, causing the stars in his vision to crackle. He could feel more than see the tips of each one beginning to connect with wisps of what looked like a coloured black hole. He expected to be taken back to the snake-ladies' (lady's?) realm when his outward eye ""blinked,"" but instead he was shot into the middle of what he could only imagine as Hell.













There was the castle he recognized from Tom, yet it seemed to fade in and out of various states of disarray:













The castle would first appear as it had when Tom had introduced it--large, obtrusive, magnificent. Hari watched as the sky turned from a sleepy blue into a hazy grey, large creatures beating against the clouds and screeching just so that Hari's ear were ringing and he had begun to claw at them. Hari knew these creatures from Tom's scoffing about the follies of muggles who believed they could be so easily slain--these were dragons. The sky lit up in oranges, blues, and whites of dragonfire, allowing Hari to see the grounds covered in more bodies than he could begin to count, and he choked on the stench that assaulted him. Smoke filled the air, and Hari gasped at the mockery of a reprieve from the smell of rotting corpses, only to inhale and have his throat burned from the inside out.













The image swayed, and returned to the immaculate picture it had originally been, before a new horror descended upon it.













He do nothing more than watch, solidified in place,  as strange plants sprouted from the ground and grew at a rate Hari was vaguely sure not even chloromancy could accomplish. There had to be dozens that Hari hadn't a name for, in colours that reminded him of the dark parts of lakes no one ever swam to, or the frigid snow he had nearly frozen in. They covered the grounds, breaking up terrain and leaving terrible gashes in the earth, ploughing through the stone walls as if they weren't even there, leaving a crumbling castle in their wake. Faceless people began to burst from the large, ornate doors, and Hari couldn't even scream a warning at them before the plants opened up hundreds of dripping mouth on each tendril and struck like a snake in brush. Green-black syrup dripped from between thorny teeth, mingling with the deep red that stained what was left of the grasses beneath, and Hari didn't think he'd ever be able to get the screaming out of his head.













When Hari thought he was going to go mad from not being able to move--not being able to even speak, the image fizzled out and the scenery around him appeared as if the horrors he had just witnessed never existed.













Hari didn't know if the next scene was better or worse than the previous ones. The castle laid in ruins, bodies in school uniforms mingling with bodies in uniforms Hari recognized from St. Mungo's. This time, the bodies were twitching in and out of corporeality like the static on Ms--on  Mamae's telly. Bodies teleported all over the grounds with varying states of gore ripped from their bodies, viscera scattered around them, before disappearing and reappearing in a new place, and an entirely new state. Despite the carnage, everything was completely silent. Everything was cold. Everything was dark.













It started as soft as a breeze on his skin--the whispering. Voices began overlapping each other, trying to speak over one another, each begging Hari for something he couldn't understand. They grew impossibly loud, impossibly incoherent, drowning him, amd before he knew it he was falling through the mud-like layers of his mindscape.













He fell back into the bridge he could scarcely remember. The silks from her swarming around him and holding him close, trying to comfort him through the shrieking in his head. He could feel them mingling together, an overbearing presence in his mind that made him feel as if he were about to implode. Just when Hari thought he couldn't take anymore, his throat raw from begging, they mingled into one and spoke with the voice of the yellow snake--














""When hope turns to dust









And blood turns to rust









A child goes to war















When the blind can see









And so walks the lame









A child goes to war again















When fire fills the sky









And the Gods collide









A child goes to war.""














Hari opened his mouth to question, but was violently ripped from his mindscape by the sound of his Mamae's screaming.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













""No, I will not let you take him!"" 













Ms. Figg  seemed quite insistent on letting someone named Dumbledore know that she wouldn't be letting him take Hari away.













""They would've let him die, Albus! How can you say he's better off there!?"" 













    The answering voice was too soft for Hari to understand, and he felt a tiny bit of shame seep through him as he opened the door completely silent and creeped down his hallway. The minute he saw his Mamae though, he almost wished he hadn't.













    Her hair fell in ratty tangles in a mockery of last night's curls, she was slumped over in her favourite green armchair, and she was crying. Hari didn't like it when she cried. He completely ignored the old man sitting across from her (ironically, in the seat Hari had sat himself hours a day earlier), barreling himself into his Mamae's chest and whispering quiet it's alrights into her tear-soaked blouse.













""Ah, Hari, my boy. I admit, I was hoping this wouldn't be the way we first met.""













    Hari turned on Ms. Figg's lap and spared the old man a glance.







    He was an odd-looking fellow, Hari thought. He had a rather impressive beard and mop of hair, both which were silver white and trailed past his navel. He was wearing a suit, which would have  looked as if it belonged on anyone else than this particular man if not for the appalling shade of yellow it sported. Hari fixed him with the nastiest look he could muster, one that mustn't of been too impressive with his sleep-stunted eyes and sniffling nose.













    ""My name is Albus Dumbledore, and I've come to take you home."" He fixed Hari with a gentle smile. Hari simply sniffed back.













    ""I am home.""













Dumbledore's smile grew stiff. ""Hari, my boy, to your real home. Your aunt and uncle miss you dreadfully.""









""My aunt put me in a hospital with half my arm melted off. Y'know, after she put me in the hospital for nearly forcing me to freeze to death.""















    Dumbledore dropped all attempts of a smile. Instead, he folded his hands in his lap and looked at Hari very seriously. Hari, in turn, could feel something cold pressing against what felt like the inside of his forehead.













    'Look away! He's a Legilimens.' 













Tom didn't have to tell him twice before Hari fixed his gaze on the odd periwinkle tie around Dumbledore's neck instead of anywhere on his face. The only indication that perhaps Dumbledore suspected Hari was purposefully avoiding him was a miniscule tightening to his features, before he put on another genial smile.













""Now, Hari, my boy, I'm sure you're exaggerating. We all know you've had some--trouble--in school."" Before Hari, or even Ms. Figg, could open their mouths to speak, Dumbledore raised a hand and continued.



















""You've put me in a precarious position, my boy, and I'm afraid I have no other alternatives. Either you willingly return to the Dursley house and be allowed entry to Hogwarts, or be forced back with your acceptance letter withheld.""













""Oh, Albus, you can't--""













""Now, now, Arabella, there are stakes in place you can't begin to imagine. Hari's relatives provide protection from Voldemort and his followers that even I can't replicate; that even Gringotts can't replicate.""













    Hari felt his Mamae go still, her arms wound tightly around him, as if she was afraid if she let go he would slip away. For all Hari knew, he would.













""But Albus--""













Hari knew they had lost from the tone in Ms. Figg's voice. She never sounded like that. He could feel Tom's scales bristling out, scraping against his mental walls as he whipped back and forth in a mockery of pacing.














    'I'll kill him. I don't care how--I'll kill him--'














Hari gently tuned out Tom's tirade and stood. He half-expected his Mamae's arms to reel around him like a vice, but they simply fell away as if they'd never been there.













    ""If--if I go with you, can I still see Ms. Figg?""













    Dumbledore gained a strange, almost satisfaction from Hari's question.













""Yes, yes of course, my boy.""













""And--and you'll keep them from hurting me?""













""Have no worries, my boy."" 













It didn't exactly quell Hari's fears, but he didn't think he'd get much more than that.













    ""I-I need to--to go pack. My th--""













""No need, my boy!"" My boy. Hari decided he quiet hated that phrase. ""Your relatives have assured me that they have everything you need.""













    ""Can I at least say goodbye?""













""My dear boy, what do you think this is?"" 













His smile was inviting but his words felt like tempered steel against Hari's soul.He turned and gave Ms. Figg one last hug, inhaling as deep as he could to try to memorize the way she smelled, the way she felt, and tried to forget the way she sounded when having her heart broken all over again. He stepped away and tried to take in the sight of their house--of her house--one last time, but he only caught a glimpse before he felt like a fishhook had slotted itself behind his navel and forced him away.













It was all too soon that he found himself back in front of the glaringly pristine front door of Number Four, Privet Drive. Dumbledore began to hum to himself as he patted down his coat, seemingly absent minded.













""I almost forgot! Here we are--"" He handed Hari a crisp envelope with large, curved letters that addressed it to one H. Potter. ""Your Hogwarts letter, dear boy.""



















""Oh, and Hari? One more thing.""













He looked at Dumbledore, who had procured a strange, bulbed wand from gods knew where. ""Just a bit of insurance, my boy.""













The last thing Hari knew before he was consumed by darkness was the tip of a wand pressed to his mid-forehead, and a whisper of a spell that sounded more like a betrayal.














""Obliviate.""

He knows he is an extraordinarily lucky child, to have always had some place that felt like home. Sometimes, he despairs of the fact that he's torn between two countries, and he's sure he's allowed that, but he has always had a home, and that is more than some children ever get. He is keenly aware that he is even more lucky that his parents were always there and attentive and loving, and knows that luck, already monumental, increased exponentially thanks to the fact that his family had money enough to keep him in clothes that fit and well fed and then some.

He knows he is immeasurably lucky to have even one home, but here he is, finding another.

Sirius is splayed out on the dormitory floor, making his crude attempt at starfishhood look elegant, while lecturing Peter, who's curled up in a little ball at the foot of his bed, looking twitchy and dissatisfied. Remus, never one to throw himself into the fray, is watching them from his seat on the windowsill, a lazy, contented smile on his face. James plops down next to Peter, throws an arm around his shoulders, and edges into what Sirius is calling their ""debate"", even though it seems awfully one sided to him.

""Yeah"", he says, ""maybe Petey can't beat you in a foot race, but he's a loads better friend than you are.""

Peter brightens up as Sirius frowns melodramatically, and James grins, ruffling Peter's hair.

Yeah, he thinks, this does feel like home."

Last Christmas, he'd asked for a children's potions set, a periwinkle silk cravat to match the one that Father wore, and a baby sister. Here it was, Halloween, and his wish for a sister was coming true. He took her picture from his trouser pocket; it was well worn as he looked at it periodically throughout his day and passed it around to every person he met. Lyra Malfoy-Potter had black hair and reddish-brown skin like Daddy and her eyes were two different colours, one blue and one violet. In her picture, she was giggling, and Cygnus counted five teeth. Cygnus was six years old and he could count up to 335, but Lyra did not have that many teeth.

Cygnus was waiting, somewhat impatiently, in the sitting room for Father and Daddy. It'd been three months since he'd gotten Lyra's picture from a Ministry owl, and that was a long enough time to wait. Today they were finally going to bring his sister home forever, which was why he was wearing his best wool cloak. Cygnus removed Daddy's wand from his sleeve, extinguished the lights, and got up to see what was taking so long. He found Father and Daddy in the kitchen. They were dressed in their own cloaks (Daddy had on the green scarf that made Father so happy), and they were hugging.

""Boo,"" said Cygnus.

Cygnus could see that Daddy was crying, so he lifted his arms to be picked up. He really was too old to be carried like a baby, but Father had explained that Halloween was a sad day for Daddy. Daddy picked him up, and Cygnus kissed his wet cheek.

""Don't be sad, Daddy.""

He knows his daughter has good taste, (he's mated to a Black too) but that still can't seem to quell his quiet sorrow. The room is still faintly scented of his lady-wife and his only child, his precious daughter, his miracle. The wedding is a show of an honestly disgusting amount of extravagance, and it's with a rueful chuckle that he's reminded of his adolescence and his wedding at the constantly moving hustle and bustle.


""Been chasing a pretty omega across Europe, eh?"" 



Charlus gripped the wood of the railing so hard that it might've splintered. It's a small mercy that he has tight control over his pheremones, because otherwise the whole yacht deck would reek of agitated alpha. A tight smile works its way across his face, and anyone who knows his smile, even his fake society mask, will know that this one is painfully fake. She has always just been 'Little Dorea' to him. To all of them. But when he stalks across Europe to find her, he cannot answer Heir Urquhart with honesty when he asks if he's been ""chasing some pretty omega across Europe"". After all, she has long since ceased to be 'some pretty omega'. She has ceased to be 'the young lady who entertains him'. She has eclipsed him entirely, she is all he yearns to chase after. He wants to mate her, he wants to scent her, he wants her familiar radiance about him every second of every day. She is not 'Petite Reine Dorea'. She is a daughter of the gods, divinely fair; and for some infuriating reason, she refuses to belive him. 



But today, she is simply a laughing memory that dances through his thoughts whenever his eyes close. Why must she continually elude him? His eyes rove over the now familiar streets and canals as everyone gets off at the pier; his peripheral vision alerting him to any passing ladies in blue or black. His eyes may have decieved him, but his nose won't. The scent Dorea possesses is unique in a way nobody else's is. Her scent was turpentine and oils, roses and nosegays, wet earth after rain. It drove him wild. His senses aching for the smallest taste of her aura, he lets himself pine over that which quite possibly will never come to be, if Heir Prince ""goes properly down on his knees"". 



He was roaming the streets of Venice aimlessly, squandering his time out on the continent, doing everything Dorea told him not to do. It was poor compensation for his lovelornity, and no amount of gelato and coffee and brandy will change that.  



It is precisely because they are not two flints that will ignite a flame, it is precisely because cool, shrewd Dorea will look at him with disgust, that he feels his control slip sharply between his fingers. She sends his thoughts whirling helplessly, she made him cling to every word she spoke. He knew when he was trying Dorea Black's famed temper, but he will provoke her, if only to see that delicious flush dance across her pale skin, like a wash of salmon watercolor on the priciest paper he could find for her. Whatever she said to him before she disappeared into the Swiss Alps was good advice, but that won't stop him from snorting in annoyance into his champagne once he's drunk.



When he asks her, when he knows (he thinks) he's being earnest, she dances out of his grasp once more. She will not be second to anyone in something again. Does it matter that he wants to feel her rapidly warming cheeks in his hands? Does it matter that the very sight of her evokes the flame that the embers of forgotten boyish flames will never be able to? Heir Prince is a lucky man, he thinks. He won't envy Rigel his lady-wife. 



Meeting her again wasn't what he expected it to be. He expected it to be an icy meeting between two old friends, an old connection thoroughly lost. He hadn't expected to be welcomed into her life with open arms, to feel the same compassion he'd felt years ago. Heir Charlus Potter should've been the name of someone who was long since dead to her. But that simply isn't true, and that makes him fall in love with her that much more. 



Dorea rushing to clean the place up, as if trying to remove the stain of her presence from the room, isn't something he expects to see.  'Raphaella, Little genius, what pain plagues you?' Rome took the vanity out of her, did it? He hears her nearly break down, the quivering in her voice and her tone.



""Well, I'm not an individual Charlus. I'm just a omega. Any other family would let me live, let me breathe. But not this one."" 



Mother Magic disagrees with her because he said so. He will convince her of that. Love isn't something that happens to you, but when you fall faster than you'd expect, tumbling and crashing like the highest waves, it can feel like it. ""Do you love him?""  He might kill himself if the answer is yes. He might kill himself if the answer is no.



Either way, he will have to live in a world where Dorea's laughs, her scent, her touches are all reserved for Rigel Prince, who is apparently-""rich, richer than you even."" Or he will have to drink himself to death, plagued by the fear that even if she doesn't love Rigel Prince, even if she still loves him, she chose to reserve her kisses and hugs and touches for 'dear old Rigel', simply because he had fooled himself into thinking he loved Lyra.  



The party in Paris three months later isn't just a scandal. It's an absolute disaster. 



He is so drunk that he can barely sense the people next to him. He lets Dorea fume at him, because it is well deserved. He will apologise to Raphaella for his behaviour tomorrow in the studio, but today, he is just an idiot who hurts her. He's shown her up, he's willfully ignored her because of his own fear.  ""Rigel Prince, ladies and gentlemen!"" It is ever so crass, and it humiliates her. He is so, so stubborn. Either he gets his way or nothing.  



The words are a fading memory now. Rigel Prince, goddammit. He will tear Rigel's throat out while he's shifted, he will pin him and make him cry out for mercy. He will have the satisfaction of a blooded death, since he cannot have her for his own, and it's all his fault. 



""Rich, richer than you even."" ""I've always known that I would marry rich, what is there to be ashamed of?""  



Charlus has never wanted for anything in his life, but now he feels twofold heartbreak, and the flickering flame of the love he had fooled himself into having for Lyra is nothing compared to the inferno Dorea has set loose within him. Dorea's laughter, her scream of fear when he fell through the ice, her society mask and her sincerity, her talent and her energy, her 'lack of genius', every one of those things he has witnessed. Rigel can't claim as much, can he? He still remembers the way Dorea would move him around and adjust the poses she wanted him to hold.



She has always been glorious, but seeing her run out of the weaving hall, moments after he tells her she's beautiful, only to kiss both of Rigel Prince's cheeks, to giggle when he serenades her with his friends, to hold his arms and walk through the manor gardens, he feels a resigned sort of weight settle in his soul. Vibrant and fair, elegant and exuberant, they look simply perfect for each other. Their strengths and talents play off of the other beautifully, he thinks. But he won't embarass Dorea anymore. He won't drown his anxious anger in wine. He'll submerge himself over his head in music, that the lonely bachelor may have something to sink into more than he already has. 



When news from across the atlantic makes Dorea long for company, it is long gone. Charlus, vowing to do some good with himself, apparently convinced that he cannot have her, has run all the way to Vienna. Cedrella is dead, and Dorea never got to say goodbye. Cedrella has disappeared from before her, and Dorea thinks she's let all the loves she's ever had in her life slip through her fingers. She won't let her father treat her like it's the dark ages. Her favorite person in the world died whelpng an heir for someone she didn't love. A mate she never wanted. She won't let her father tell her that a good omega would be willing to make sacrifices for their pack, for their family. She won't let her father sell her off to the richest man he can find. She's going to find Charlus and tell him that she doesn't hate him. She's going to tell Charlus that she's never despised him, and could never bring herself to. She will tell him he holds her heart, that she wants the best for him, for them. 



Charlus meanwhile, discovers that he is in over his head, and when the opera fails to give him the bittersweet comfort he hoped it would; he rips his pleasing chaos of pegasi, crest embroidered ribbons, peacocks and a charming and faceless lady to pieces. He will not be satisfied until the phantom of Dorea's voice has come to haunt him in the back of his mind, and he admits to himself that talent truly isn't genius, and no amount of energy, or even loverlike fury can make it so. Vienna proves itself to be useless, and once the pieces are sold and he sets out for finding a better place to hide his misery, Mother sends the painful news from back home. He feels his hopes continue to shatter. At least Dorea will find comfort in her lord- husband. He, on the other hand, has no idea where to run to next. 



Dorea tears through her papers, scribbling the volumes to him that she thought would come courtesy of Lyra, not her. But when comfort wraps its arms about you gently, you cannot help but strangle yourself within it until you feel yourself choking. The silks, the cross, the black ribbon in her hair-now left mostly open in the privacy of the Switzerland estate her cousin Alphard owns-everything about her was in the waiting game. 



There was nothing to do but wait. 



She could tell the world that she was fine with turning down Rigel's proposal now. She could finally say that it was for the best. She could also continue denying that she did it out of a pining, distant affection for ""the Potter boy"". But the barest trace of his scent in the garden would have her desperate to shift that exact moment, and meet him as fast as she could. She knew it. She'd fantasised about it plenty of times. When the moment comes, however, she can't do much but wait. She stands there, looking at him like she would like to drink him in like a fine wine and savor the feeling of his alpha aura for ages. When those familiar feelings crescendo in her soul once again, she doesn't have the heart to bury them again. She sends them out when she cries that she knew, she just knew he'd come to her. She hopes he will know she is sincere. 



The news is enough to stun him. Dorea has turned him down. She has turned Rigel Prince down. She has escaped from the insanity of her family, of a pack that mistreated her. There is almost something expectant in the way she looks up at him, the way her cross hammers over her skin because of her rapid pulse, the way she stares at him with wet lashes and sobs quietly enough that he can't hear her, but can feel her shaking in his embrace. He holds her tight, he tells her simply, that he cannot let her travel alone and unmated while having to care for herself. He cannot let her feel lonely and homesick when there is anything in his power he can do to remedy it; even if she does despise him. 



When she whispers that no, she doesn't despise him, when she whispers that she has turned Rigel Prince down, when she whispers that he is under no obligation to say or do anything, when she whispers that she's free, he briefly wonders if the grief of a friend's passing has driven him to invent a fantasy of a happy reality. Dorea's aura is beside him, clamouring for his attention, screaming otherwise. When he kisses her, he kisses her like it's the last time he'll ever see her. He kisses her like he's binding his soul to hers. He kisses her like the weeping watercolours that smudge and blur together in her paintings, into a single masterpiece. When he pulls back, he can hardly believe that this is what it's come to. He has her at last, and he won't rest until she is sure of that fact that she is never a second place, a replacement. He won't stop until he has scented her so strongly that she smells taken and safe and owned. He won't let go of her until he is sure, absolutely sure, that nothing can rip her away from him.  



The first time he takes Dorea to his home, the first time he whisks her away from Europe, the wonder in her eyes is spectacular. She spends hours painting and sketching the city in every hour of the day. He takes her on private tours of old forts and castles, out on the lake and around the bazaars. It's a lost heritage that becomes part of muggle society as time goes on, but the magical are insistent in their desire to preserve their history. Watching someone you love seeing something you know well with fresh eyes is incredible, Charlus thinks. The world around them vibrates with the energy of kings and queens from the eras gone by, and it is there that he thinks of a name for a baby girl, a sharp and talented one, one he would feel unworried handing the title to. 


Charlus snaps out of a year's worth of memories out on the continent when his darling daughter steps in for help. She's wearing her mother's wedding lehenga, and it had made his jaw drop when he saw Dorea in it. He wonders if it is possible for it to have the same effect on Sirius. He named her Jahanara for a reason. Queen of the world, and she truly looks the part. He won't scent her again. He won't see her for two months. He runs his fingers through her hair to tie it into an intricate low bun for the last time. When he hands her over to her chosen mate, someone she loves with her whole heart, to someone she trusts with her life, he cannot be upset with anything anymore. They've prevented history from repeating itself. Jahanara Cedrella is a Black now, and when crowds of friends and family congratulate them, the swelling sense of pride cannot be helped.

Petite Reine Dorea has birthed someone incredible. She's going to make something incredible of her life.  Charlus is assualted by memories of Rigel and Dorea's ill-fated courtship. He sees his mate running to someone who won't embarrass her, to someone who will love her and keep her contented for the rest of her life.


Rigel Prince, ladies and gentlemen! 



You are beautiful. 



Rich, richer than you are even. 


The feeling disappears quickly. Dorea is next to him today, and always will be. Their story is one that too many people know, a story with it's fair share of messes and accidents. But Dorea, calm, cool and loving Dorea, Dorea with her ebony hair and her warm gold eyes, Dorea with her laughter and her cutting comments and her talent, she will stand with him and stand by him forever."

For a long moment, Ron Weasley forgot to breathe. Harry - Harry Potter! - had been Sorted into Slytherin. Slytherin! The home of every Dark wizard for centuries. Dark lords were always Slytherins, everyone knew that. Only evil wizards were sent there. That was what his brothers had always said.

But Harry wasn't evil. 

Ron thought about how shy and scared Harry had looked sitting alone in the compartment, about how he didn't know anything about the magical world, about how he bought more sweets than Ron had ever seen in his life and shared them without even thinking about it. He remembered how Harry had refused to shake Malfoy's hand, and how he had stood up for Ron despite only knowing him a few hours, and for the first time a sliver of doubt wormed its way into his heart. 

Slytherins were evil, but Harry Potter was not.

""Weasley, Ronald.""

Ron started. He had completely forgotten about the Sorting. He stumbled over to the stool, almost collapsing onto it. The last thing he saw as the Hat dropped down over his face was a pair of terrified green eyes.


""My, my, you are an interesting lot this year.""


""What's that supposed to mean?"" Ron demanded. ""And why did you put Harry in Slytherin?""

""I believe we are here to talk about you, Mr. Weasley, not your classmates,"" said the Hat dryly. 


""But-""



""Yes, very interesting. A surprisingly logical mind; that does help with chess I suppose. Loyalty, oh yes, there is very little you wouldn't do for someone who has earned your trust. Even start to consider changing your mind about Slytherin.""


""What?"" Ron yelped. ""I haven't-""

""You students would do well to listen to my songs now and then,"" the Hat interrupted, and its voice was so firm that Ron fell silent. ""Slytherin does not deserve the reputation it currently bears.""


""But You-Know-Who was a Slytherin!""



""And many of his followers were Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, and Gryffindors, yes, even Gryffindors. Actually, the house least likely to turn out Dark wizards is Hufflepuff, but we are drifting from the matter at hand.""


Ron was silent for a minute. He could hardly believe what he was hearing, but it wasn't like the Sorting Hat had any reason to lie to him. ""Why are you telling me all this?"" he asked finally. ""I'm not going to stop talking to Harry, if that's what you're after.""


""I am glad to hear that, but as I said before, we are not here to talk about Harry Potter.""


It took a long moment to get it, then, ""You've got to be joking!""


""Not about this, Mr. Weasley.""



""There's never been a Weasley in Slytherin!""


""There has not,"" the Hat agreed. ""Unless you count Cedrella Weasley, though admittedly she was born a Black and married into your family. But then again, I thought you wanted to be out of your brothers' shadows?""

Ron's arguments died in his throat. The Hat took full advantage of his silence. ""You want to stand out from your family. You want to be known and respected for who you are. You have a good mind, when you choose to use it, and you are strong enough to choose your own path. You could do very well in Slytherin.""

Ron shook his head numbly, but a larger part of him than he would like to admit was actually considering it. It would be different. Certainly none of his brothers had done it. But what would they say? What would his parents say? The thought was as terrifying as it was intriguing.

The Hat was silent, and Ron somehow knew it wouldn't say anything else. This was his decision.

He had been told he was strong enough to choose his own path. Ron closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and did so.

Harry Potter was still reeling from the Sorting Hat's decision. He was a Slytherin. Voldemort, the man who killed his parents, had been a Slytherin. He had tried to argue when the Hat suggested it, but hadn't had a chance before it was bellowing its decision and sealing Harry's fate. He had barely registered the whispers that rippled through the Great Hall, or the frowns on some of the teachers' faces. He hadn't been able to look at Hagrid.

He had felt the derision coming from his new housemates though. No one had made space for him, and he had sunk onto the very end of the bench feeling like he was back in primary school, where everyone knew who he was, and no one would dare be friendly to him for risk of angering Dudley. Malfoy was whispering fiercely a few seats away, his grey eyes glittering, and Harry swallowed. He didn't exactly regret rejecting Malfoy on the train, not after the way he'd looked at Ron, but Harry had to admit that it was going to make life harder.

At least he had a chance with the other first-years, with the exception of Crabbe and Goyle.

Harry watched Ron sit to be Sorted with horribly mixed feelings. His friend had looked horrified, and Harry remembered with a pang what Ron had said on the train. Surely being a Slytherin couldn't matter that much. They could still be friends.

The brim of the Hat split open, and Harry's heart started pounding hard enough to hurt.

""SLYTHERIN!""

""What?""

""No!""

There was uproar, nearly as much as there had been when Harry had been Sorted. The rest of the Weasleys at the Gryffindor table were on their feet, all talking at the tops of their voices, and Professor McGonagall looked equally nonplussed.

Harry didn't care. He was so relieved he thought he might burst. Ron was in Slytherin. He wasn't alone.

Professor McGonagall recovered herself, and gave Ron a gentle push in the direction of the Slytherin table. Ron sank onto the bench next to Harry. His face was very pale, his freckles standing out in sharp relief, but he managed a weak grin.

""Fancy seeing you here.""

Harry laughed, and he didn't care that nerves made it sound hysterical. A first year a few seats away, Nott-something, rolled his eyes, and pointedly turned to talk to Malfoy, but Harry didn't care. Whatever happened now, they could handle it.

""I thought you wanted Gryffindor,"" he said, when he had caught his breath.

Ron shrugged. ""The Hat made some good arguments. And, well, at least people can tell me apart from the rest of them now.""

Despite his confident tone, Harry noticed that he was carefully avoiding looking at the Gryffindor table. The rest of the Weasleys had quietened, thanks to McGonagall's glare, but they all looked upset and confused, and Harry's stomach twisted.

""It'll be okay,"" he said quietly. ""You're still you, right? They can't...they have to know that.""

Ron gave a slightly queasy looking smile, and looked back towards the front of the Hall. Harry followed his gaze, and saw that the very last boy was being Sorted now. Nott huffed and looked up from examining his goblet with a bored scowl.

""Come on,"" he muttered. ""Everyone knows Zabini will be-""

""GRYFFINDOR!""

Nott dropped the goblet.

""What?"" Malfoy demanded.

He wasn't the only one. Students up and down the Slytherin table, and at the other tables for that matter, were exchanging startled whispers. Harry glanced at Ron, and was relieved to see that he, at least, looked as confused as he felt.

""Zabini,"" Ron muttered under his breath. ""I think I've heard that name somewhere...""

Harry shook his head. Nott threw them both an exasperated look and turned back to the head table without bothering to explain. Harry looked over to where Zabini was taking a seat next to Hermione Granger. He seemed perfectly at ease, even amused by the commotion he had caused. Even as Harry stared, Zabini caught his eye and gave him a bright smile, before turning to accept a welcoming handshake from Percy.

Harry stared a moment longer, before looking back at his own plate. What had that been about? He made a firm mental note to keep an eye on Zabini, but then Albus Dumbledore was rising to his feet, and Harry forgot everything else. He settled in, expecting one of the long speeches his primary school headmistress had been so fond of, but the wizarding world surprised him once again.

""Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""

Harry found himself staring again, until Ron elbowed him. ""Harry, food!""

Harry had never seen so much food in his life, but even as he started helping himself to everything in arm's reach, he couldn't help but look back up at the staff table. Dumbledore was tucking merrily into some roast beef, his beard thrown back over his shoulder to keep it out the way. Harry swallowed.

""Ron, is the Headmaster, well...""

""Senile?"" suggested one of the older boys, leading to a round of snickers. Ron went bright red, but stuffed a forkful of turkey into his mouth instead of arguing. Harry let out a breath; he didn't want to start a fight on their very first night.

The girl on Harry's other side rolled her eyes. ""He's old, and the most powerful wizard in the country,"" she said dryly. ""Of course he's odd."" She caught Harry's eye, and held out a hand. ""Daphne Greengrass,"" she introduced herself. 

Harry shook it. ""Harry Potter.""

""We know,"" said the dark-skinned girl sitting opposite Daphne, but at least she smiled as she said it. ""I'm Tracey Davis."" She looked past him to Ron. ""Interesting to see a Weasley in Slytherin.""

Ron swallowed his food, and shrugged. ""Had to happen sooner or later.""

There was a snort from further up at the table, and Harry was somehow unsurprised to see Malfoy sneering. ""I don't know what Slytherin is coming to,"" he said. ""Blood-traitors, half-bloods. What's next, Mu-""

""Watch yourself, Malfoy,"" said Tracey. Her voice was quite polite, but her hand had drifted close to her wand. Her eyes flickered pointedly up to the head table. Malfoy sneered, but turned to continue his conversation with one of the upper years.

Harry had no idea what Malfoy was talking about, but the looks on Ron's and Tracey's faces were enough for him to glare at Malfoy. Tracey picked up her knife again, then looked Harry straight in the eye. 

""My father is a Muggle,"" she said clearly. ""Everyone already knows, it's no secret.""

""And my mother was a Muggle-born,"" said Harry, with a slow nod. He didn't understand why it made a difference, but he got that there was one. Next to him, Ron sighed.

""Forgot how seriously Slytherins take this stuff,"" he muttered. Then he shrugged, and took a jacket potato. ""Too late to change now.""

Daphne raised an eyebrow. ""It's not like you have anything to worry about,"" she pointed out.

Harry shot a questioning glance at Ron, who shook his head. ""I'll explain it all later,"" he promised. ""Go on, you need to eat more.""

He had a point, and Harry spent the next few minutes enjoying the best meal he had ever had in his life. He paid attention to the conversation around him though, quickly identifying fellow first-years Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson, and confirming that Malfoy was just as much of an arrogant prat as he had suspected. He was tuning out a story about flying in favour of reaching for the jug of pumpkin juice when Ron suddenly dropped his cutlery with a loud clatter. Harry looked up, and found himself face to face with a grim, blood-stained ghost.

Maybe it was just one shock too many after the day he had had, but Harry just stared back.

""Oh,"" he said. ""Hello. How do you do?""

Pansy let out a squeak, and scooted away from him up the bench. Harry glanced round, and saw everyone watching him in open-mouthed amazement. Malfoy in particular looked torn between screaming and running from the hall.

An odd, rasping noise drew Harry's attention back to the ghost. His gaunt face was twisted into a mocking grin, and Harry realised with a start that the noise was supposed to be laughter. After a very awkward moment, the ghost shook his head and looked back at Harry.

""Good evening, Harry Potter. I will be keeping a close eye on you.""

Harry swallowed and nodded. ""I, er, okay then.""

The ghost inclined his head, and strode off through the table towards the older students. Harry watched him go in bemusement, and then realised that everyone was gaping at him.

""What?""

Ron's face was slowly regaining its colour, but he still looked shaken. ""How did you do that?""

Harry could only shrug. After everything that had happened today, a bloody ghost didn't seem like such a big deal. Nott stared at him for a moment, then shook his head.

""Potter, that was the Bloody Baron. People don't talk to him.""

Harry felt the blush start to spread across his cheeks, and had to fight the urge to duck his head. He was getting tired of everyone looking at him. He started on his dinner again, despite no longer being hungry, and Ron followed suit after only a second's hesitation. Harry could feel the stares from the other first years, and older students for that matter, but he ignored them and eventually the various conversation around them resumed. He stabbed moodily at his untouched vegetables and sighed. At this rate, it was going to be a long seven years.

By the time the puddings had come and gone, Harry was struggling to keep his eyes open. He nearly groaned when Dumbledore stood up again, but the Headmaster's words were enough to wake him up.

""What does he mean, a most painful death?""

He was relieved when the other Slytherins looked as startled as he felt. Malfoy's mouth was already curling into a sneer, but Nott, Parkinson and the others were listening with the utmost attention. Harry glanced round the Great Hall. Some students seemed to be taking the warning as a bit of a joke, Ron's twin brothers included, but most were frowning as they listened. Blaise Zabini, Harry noticed, looked as thoughtful as Percy Weasley.

""Blimey,"" Ron whispered next to him. ""I know Charlie said he was a bit mental, but no one ever said anything like this.""

Harry swallowed. Just when he thought the year couldn't get any more complicated.

After a rendition of the school song that left Harry with even more doubts regarding the Headmaster's sanity, the feast finally came to an end. Full and sleepy, Harry and Ron followed the rest of their new housemates down a flight of stairs and along a number of twisting corridors before finally coming to an unremarkable stretch of wall. A tall, blonde girl glanced round and smiled at the first years.

""Make sure you remember this spot. Knowing the password won't do much good if you're talking to a normal wall.""

Harry frowned, but his confusion cleared when the girl turned back to the wall and said clearly, ""Wolfsbane.""

The wall slid aside, and Harry followed her through a stone archway into the Slytherin Common Room. At his shoulder, Ron gasped.

""Wow.""

That about summed up Harry's feelings too. He'd guessed they were underground from the amount of stairs they had taken, but he hadn't expected the windows that stretched from floor to ceiling and revealed the inky depths of the lake. The room was lit by torches and fireplaces that burned with strange green flames, and every decoration and piece of furniture spoke of understated elegance. It was a far cry from the fastidious modern fashions that Aunt Petunia favoured. Maybe that was why Harry immediately decided he liked it.

The older students scattered to the various chairs, or to their dormitories, with the exception of the blonde who had given the password. She had walked to the centre of the room, where she was joined by a slightly shorter Middle Eastern boy. They spoke quietly together for a minute, then the girl clapped her hands.

""All right, first years over here, please.""

Malfoy promptly pushed his way to the front. Harry caught Ron grumbling under his breath as they stopped next to Tracey Davies, who smiled at them before focusing on the older students.

""My name is Gemma Farley,"" said the girl, ""and this is Mohammed Shafiq. We are the fifth year prefects for Slytherin, and so we are the ones you can come to if you get into trouble.""

""Or if you simply want some advice,"" Shafiq added. There was a mischievous gleam in his dark eyes. ""Whatever you might have heard about Slytherins, we do look out for each other, whether that means standing up to the other houses, or just sharing some of our hard-earned wisdom."" He grinned. ""And trust me, you'll appreciate it after your first History of Magic lesson.""

Farley rolled her eyes. ""Very true. However, while we're on the topic of what you might have heard about Slytherins...""

But Harry never got to find that out. A dark figure had suddenly appeared in the archway, and silence immediately fell over the room. Glittering eyes met Harry's, and Harry had to resist the urge to step back. Not even Uncle Vernon had looked at him with such open dislike.

Farley recovered first, and inclined her head respectfully.

""Good evening, Professor Snape. We weren't expecting you.""

Snape's eyes left Harry's, and he moved forward until he was standing next to her. ""Good evening, Miss Farley. I will take it from here.""

Harry swallowed. Snape's voice was low and smooth, but there was an authority in it that caught and held the attention of everyone in the house. Both prefects stepped aside immediately, and Snape fixed gimlet eyes on the first years.

""You have been sorted into Slytherin House.""

His voice was so quiet that everyone had to strain to hear it. Harry hardly dared to breathe.

""If you are here, then somewhere within you lies the seeds of greatness. Slytherin will help you develop whatever gifts and talents you may possess, and allow you to pursue whatever ambitions you may hold."" He paused, and his eyes hardened. ""Provided, of course, that you do truly belong here.""

His eyes met Harry's, and there was no mistaking the disdain there. ""I expect nothing but the best from each and every one of you. Ignorance, and lack of understanding,"" his eyes flickered to Ron before returning to Harry, ""are no excuse. Should any student here bring shame or ridicule upon this house, I can assure you that the consequences will be...unpleasant.""

Harry glared back. He still wasn't sure why he was here, but the fact that Snape didn't seem to think he should be was enough to make his blood burn. He saw Snape's eyes narrow as the Professor continued, ""I expect your behaviour, and performance in class to be of credit to Slytherin, and to me. Anything else will not be tolerated."" His eyes glittered at Harry, even as his lip curled into a sneer. ""No matter how...celebrated the culprit may be.""

With that he nodded to the silent prefects and swept from the room, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry let out a slightly shaky breath. 

The whispering began the moment everyone was sure Snape was gone. Harry glanced round, and saw the older students exchange unreadable looks. Next to him, Ron shifted.

""That was weird,"" he muttered.

Harry just nodded. He felt it would be rather melodramatic to voice his suspicions that Snape already disliked him. They had never even spoken to each other. Shafiq cleared his throat, and Harry shook himself and returned his attention to the prefects.

""As Professor Snape so eloquently pointed out, we do have high expectations. However, we also understand that not everyone expected to be here."" His glance at Ron was much more welcoming than Snape's had been. ""We would much rather you come to us if you require any assistance, rather than embarrass yourselves in front of the other houses, whether that is in your studies, or in general wizarding matters.""

Harry frowned, not understanding what he meant by general wizarding matters. He would have to ask Ron. It was good to know the prefects were options if his friend couldn't help, but Harry was getting the impression that it was better not to let people know when you didn't know something in Slytherin.

Farley was nodding agreement. ""Exactly. Now, I know it's getting late, so we'll leave it there and you can come and see us if you have any questions."" She hesitated a moment, then straightened her shoulders. ""And no matter what you might have heard of Slytherin's reputation, we look after our own. No matter what political, personal, or familial disputes you might be involved in, you are all Slytherins now. Don't let us down.""

""No pressure,"" Ron whispered, but he looked more cheerful than he had while Snape had been around. Harry nodded, then found himself suppressing a yawn.

""Come on,"" he said. ""I'm exhausted.""

Yawning, they followed Shafiq and the other first year boys down yet another flight of stairs. Eventually Shafiq came to to a halt by a tall door, and glanced at them.

""All six of you will be in here this year,"" he said. ""All students share a dormitory until sixth year, when they may share a study between two, if Professor Snape agrees."" He smiled. ""Think of it as an incentive to not cause any trouble until then.""

Harry glanced at Malfoy, who looked horrified at the thought of having to share a room, and bit back his own grin. Shafiq stepped aside and waved them in. ""Breakfast starts at seven, and I'll be in the Common Room at ten to if you can't remember the way. If you want to sleep later, you'll have to ask one of the other prefects or older students to help you."" He paused. ""Not Burke. He doesn't function well in the mornings. But Professor Snape will be giving out your timetables, so make sure you do turn up. Anyway, sleep well.""

Malfoy promptly shoved past Nott so that he was the first one to enter, oblivious to the dark-haired boy's scowl. Harry gave Shafiq a smile as he passed, and was glad when it was returned, along with a clap on the back. He followed Nott through a short passage that emerged into a large circular room with six beds already made up. Each four-poster had deep green drapes, and looked so comfortable that Harry somehow felt even more tired. He stumbled towards the bed that had his trunk next to it, only to find his way blocked.

""Didn't expect to see you here, Potter,"" Malfoy spat. ""But since you are, I think now would be a good time-"" 

""Malfoy, the only thing I'm doing now is going to bed,"" Harry interrupted flatly. He raised an eyebrow. ""Unless you want to risk being late tomorrow and get into trouble on your first day?""

Malfoy hesitated, and Harry took the opportunity to slip past him. Ron folded his arms. ""We're going to be stuck together for the next five years,"" he said. ""How about we decide to leave each other alone in here, so that we can at least get separate rooms in the last couple of years, eh?"" His eyes glinted. ""Otherwise, I suppose having five elder brothers might come in handy.""

Malfoy's eyes narrowed, but Nott was nodding. ""Agreed. Nothing happens in here. I am not getting caught in the middle of anything, especially not something thought up by a Weasley.""

Ron nodded, winked at Harry, and turned back to Malfoy. Malfoy eyed him, eyes flickering between Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of the room, before his lip finally curled into a sneer. ""Fine, but you stay out of my way, Weasel."" 

Ron's jaw tightened, but Harry caught his eye and shook his head and the redhead visibly controlled himself. He claimed the bed next to Harry's, and under the guise of retrieving his pyjamas from his trunk whispered to Harry, ""Can you get up half an hour earlier tomorrow? There's some stuff you should know, now that we're here.""

""Of course,"" Harry agreed quickly. ""Thanks.""

Ron grinned at him. ""Don't mention it. We're going to have to watch out for each other.""

Warmth filled Harry's chest. He'd never had anyone watch out for him before, or anyone to watch out for for that matter. Ron winked and straightened up, and Harry turned back to his own trunk with renewed determination.

That Sorting Hat had said that he would do well in Slytherin. He was going to prove it right.

In the Gryffindor dormitories, safe in the privacy of his four poster bed, Blaise Zabini finally let his smile fade. He watched his shaking hands with abject detachment for a moment, then took a deep breath and reached for his quill.

His mother was not going to be pleased.

Apologies for the delay, the NHS is still ridiculously busy, but I hope you enjoy this chapter.

""Come on, Harry. One more time.""

Harry sighed, but just the thought of making a mistake in front of Malfoy was enough to halt any complaints. He closed his eyes, and dredged up the facts Ron had spent the last twenty minutes beating into his brain.

""Muggle-borns are witches and wizards born to non-magical parents. Half-bloods have a Muggle parent or grandparent. And people whose grandparents all have magic are purebloods.""

""But..."" Ron prompted.

Harry screwed up his face. ""But...the really crazy purists think that your blood is only pure if you don't have any Muggle blood in you at all."" He opened his eyes to frown at Ron. ""But how could they even know that?""

Ron shrugged. ""They're really obsessive about keeping track of their lineage. My Great-Aunt Muriel is a bit like that, but she doesn't really hate Muggles like they do.""

""She just thinks wizards are better.""

Ron looked away, mouth twisting into a scowl. ""There's a reason we visit as little as possible,"" he grumbled.

Harry winced. He knew what unpleasant aunts could be like. Ron continued to glare at the rug, and Harry leaned over to nudge him. ""Thanks for this, Ron. I never would have made sense of it all by myself.""

He had muddled through last night, but he knew the other Slytherins hadn't been fooled. Tracey and the other girls seemed nice enough, but Harry had had too much experience with bullies to give anyone ammunition. 

Even if he still couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. It was small consolation that Ron didn't seem to either. He glanced back over, and found his friend's ears had gone red at the compliment.

""No problem,"" Ron mumbled. ""We've got to stick together here.""

Harry smiled. It was going to take more than a day to get used to the idea of someone wanting to help him. Some of the warmth faded though as he thought more carefully about the previous night.

""The others... They really believe all this stuff, don't they?""

Ron waggled a hand in the air. ""Eh. Some more than others. Malfoy, definitely, but Tracey's a half-blood, like you, and Daphne doesn't seem to care. Guess we'll have to wait and see.""

Harry nodded, but that only led to more questions. ""Then why were they all being so nice to me?""

He hadn't wanted to question it, not after being hated all through primary school, but he was beginning to realise that he would need to be a lot more careful. Ron, though, was staring at him like he'd grown a second head, and Harry shifted in his chair. 

""What?""

""Mate, you're the Boy-Who-Lived!"" Ron spluttered. ""Of course they weren't going to try to piss you off. Except Malfoy, but he's an idiot,"" he amended. At Harry's evident confusion, he ran a hand through his hair. ""You don't get it. You-Know-Who, he's one of the most powerful Dark wizards to ever live. Everyone was terrified of him. We grew up hearing stories about how he fought a dozen Aurors at once and killed them all!""

Harry was growing more and more uncomfortable, but Ron didn't seem to notice. ""And it wasn't Dumbledore who stopped him. It was you.""

""But I didn't do anything,"" Harry protested. ""I was just a baby.""

""I know,"" said Ron quickly, ""but, Harry, no-one knows anything about you. No-one knows how strong you are, or if you have special powers or something.""

""But I don't!"" Harry protested. ""I didn't even know I had magic until a month ago!""

He had known things were bad, but he hadn't realised things were quite this extreme. Was this how everyone in the Wizarding world saw him? Even Ron when they first met had looked at him like he was someone special.

Ron's exuberance faded abruptly. He shifted in his chair, his expression suddenly uncertain. ""I don't mean it in a bad way,"" he mumbled. ""But that's how it is for us.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. He pushed aside his unease to think about that and swallowed. ""So they're scared of me. And that's why they're being nice to me.""

The words were bitter on his tongue. That was how people treated Dudley. Ron shook his head quickly. ""No, not like that. They just don't know what to expect. They're being careful."" He grinned suddenly. ""And I bet none of their families would be pleased to hear they got on your bad side on the very first day of school.""

Harry snorted, but he felt a bit better. He could understand them waiting to see what to make of him. He was doing the same thing really.

""Harry?""

Harry looked up to find Ron watching him rather warily. He cocked his head, and Ron sighed. ""I'm sorry. I didn't realise what it must be like.""

""It's okay,"" said Harry quietly. ""I think I understand now.""

The wizarding world wasn't as different from the Muggle one as he had first thought. Harry didn't know if that was a good thing or not, but as he looked at Ron's worried expression he found himself breathing easier. Ron was on his side. He smiled, and relaxed even more when Ron returned it.

He wasn't a scared outcast hiding from his cousin and his friends any more. This world was full of things he didn't understand, but that was okay. He and Ron could figure it out together.

""Well, aren't you two up early?""

Both boys spun round to see Gemma Farley coming up the stairs from the girls' dormitories. She dropped into the armchair opposite and smiled at them. ""How was your first night?""

""I slept like a log,"" Harry told her. ""The bed is a lot nicer than my one at home.""

""Good."" She finished tying back her long blonde hair, and gave them both an appraising look. ""Mo will be up in a few minutes, but do either of you have any questions for me?""

Harry shook his head. He had learned that lesson well enough at Privett Drive. Far better to try and work it out for himself, or else wait for someone else to ask the questions and then listen in. Ron, though, was nodding. 

""I did have one,"" he said. ""Say we had a problem with someone in our house, or they had one with us. Who should we talk to first?""

Farley sighed. ""Good question. Shafiq or I would be your best bet under most circumstances."" Her eye flickered to Harry before returning to Ron. ""We're the newest and most junior Prefects, and that means that you first years are our responsibility. I promise that we'll do everything we can to help you out.""

Harry relaxed slightly. If Snape really disliked him as much as he had seemed to the previous evening then the last thing Harry wanted to do was confide in him. Ron smiled, but it faded when Farley's gaze turned appraising. ""I have to ask, Ron. Are your family going to be all right with this?""

Ron dropped his gaze. ""Dunno,"" he muttered. ""I guess I'll see Percy and the twins today. I need to write to my parents though.""

""You can borrow my owl, if you want,"" Harry offered. He hesitated, then reached out to give Ron's shoulder an awkward pat. ""I'm sure it'll be fine.""

Ron didn't look convinced, but he managed a shaky smile. ""Thanks, Harry."" His shoulders slumped. ""Course, Percy probably already wrote to them last night, but I can still explain it better.""

Harry frowned, but his questions died on his lips as Daphne and Tracey bustled into the room. Nott was just behind them, his tie hanging loose around his neck, and he raised an eyebrow at Harry and Ron.

""So Crabbe and Goyle didn't kill you in your sleep and chuck your bodies in the lake.""

Ron snorted. ""I'd like to see them try. Having Fred and George around was good for some things.""

Nott cocked his head to one side and gave him an appraising look, but Tracey grinned. ""That must have been exciting. I wish I had siblings.""

""No, you don't,"" Daphne muttered. ""They're a pain in the neck.""

Tracey rolled her eyes. ""Yeah, you definitely weren't writing to Astoria last night.""

""Tracey!"" 

Harry bit the inside of his cheek to cover a grin, and saw Ron duck his head. Daphne scowled and folded her arms. ""I said I would,"" she said.

Ron shifted in his chair. ""Yeah, I promised my little sister I'd write to her too. She hates it when we all go away, and this is the first time I'm here too."" He looked down. ""Not sure she'll still want me to write when she hears about this.""

Harry swallowed. At least he knew he couldn't disappoint the Dursleys more than he already had. Daphne's scowl softened slightly. ""Have there been any non-Gryffindors in your family, Ron?""

Ron's smile was noticeably shaky. ""Not in living memory. And Aunt Muriel is really old.""

""You're still the same person you were yesterday,"" said Harry firmly. ""Your sister has to know that.""

Ron didn't look too convinced. Actually he seemed very interested in the carvings on the arm of the chair. Tracey frowned slightly, then turned to Harry. ""What about you, Harry? Will your guardians be happy?""

Harry snorted. ""They're Muggles. They couldn't care less about which house I'm in."" Tracey and Daphne exchanged a look, and Nott quirked an eyebrow, and Harry decided it was time to change the subject. ""What classes are you all looking forward to?""

Tracey's frown deepened, but before she could say anything Nott let out a jaw-cracking yawn. ""Personally, I like the sound of Charms,"" he drawled. ""Useful, practical, and far less complicated than Transfiguration.""

Harry nodded. He had looked through his textbooks over the summer, and the Transfiguration ones had just given him a headache. Ron pulled a face. ""Percy loves Transfiguration. If we get stuck he'll be very happy to help. If he still wants to talk to me,"" he added under his breath.

Daphne cocked her head to one side. ""Your brother's the newest Gryffindor Prefect, isn't he? That might be useful.""

""Or not,"" Ron muttered. ""He's been a nightmare all summer. Prefects aren't that great."" Farley raised an eyebrow, and Ron's ears went bright red. ""No offence.""

Farley shook her head, but there was a faint smile playing about her lips. More people were filling the Common Room now, some of whom cast curious looks over at the first years, but Harry did his best to ignore them. He was getting used to people gawping at him. Ron glanced at him, then glared round at the students.

""Gits,"" he muttered.

""Ron,"" said Farley lightly. 

""What? They are!""

""Its okay, Ron,"" Harry muttered. He could feel his cheeks heating up, but when he risked a glance up Tracey and Daphne were both frowning at the older students too. 

""That's just rude,"" said Daphne, with a sniff. ""Even Tori has better manners than that.""

She didn't bother keeping her voice low, and quite a few people looked away very quickly. Ron grinned at her. ""Nice one.""

Daphne inclined her head in acknowledgement. Nott shook his head and glanced at Farley. ""Is it time to go yet?""

Farley checked her watch, and at the same moment Shafiq stuck his head into the Common Room. He nodded to them and vanished again, and Farley smiled. ""A few minutes.""

Nott frowned, then his eyes gleamed. ""Can I go and watch?""

Harry blinked at him, but Tracey rolled her eyes and pulled them into a discussion on Quidditch. Ron joined in with enthusiasm, and the two of them lost Harry in seconds, but all conversation came to a halt when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle stumbled into the Common Room. All were up and dressed, but their hair was suspiciously wet and Harry smothered his laughter with an effort. Ron took one look and his eyes lit up, but Harry elbowed him in the side before he could say anything.

""We've got to deal with him for another seven years,"" he hissed. ""Let's not make things worse straight away.""

Ron pouted, but kept quiet. Malfoy stalked up to them, his thin face murderous. Daphne arched an eyebrow at him. ""Having trouble getting up, Draco?""

""That was completely unnecessary,"" Malfoy snarled. ""My father-""

""Knows exactly how Hogwarts works, Draco,"" said Shafiq cheerfully. ""Learn how to set an alarm instead of relying on a house-elf to do everything for you. Now, everyone who wants breakfast follow me.""

Harry didn't even try to stop grinning as he followed Shafiq back to the Great Hall. He had a great new friend, most of his new housemates were pretty nice, and Malfoy had been so busy glaring at Shafiq that he hadn't even looked at Harry or Ron. He was in such a good mood that he didn't even care about all the people who stopped and stared at him in the corridors, or about the whispers that seemed to follow him. 

Ron, however, was frowning.

""How long are they gonna keep doing that?""

""They'll get bored eventually,"" Daphne murmured. ""I hope."" She glanced at Harry. ""It might take some time though.""

Harry shrugged. He didn't like it, but there wasn't much he could do about it. It was the same as  being the only brown kid at school, and it was a rubbish feeling but he could deal with it. At least this time he had people on his side, and Ron and Daphne's indignation meant a lot.

It was even worse when they got to the Entrance Hall, but it was Ron who stopped short. Harry glanced at him, and saw that the blood had drained from his face.

""Ron?""

Ron swallowed. Harry followed his gaze and saw Fred and George bearing down on them. Neither of them looked happy. Shafiq gripped Ron's shoulder. ""You don't have to talk to them if you don't want to.""

""Yeah, I do,"" Ron whispered. He took a shaky breath and drew himself up. ""You go on. I'll be there in a minute.""

Shafiq held his gaze for a moment, then nodded and followed the rest of the first years. Harry, though, lingered. ""If you want me to go I will, but-""

""No,"" said Ron quickly. He managed a weak smile that Harry returned, but then the twins were there and Harry moved to stand at his friend's shoulder. Ron nodded to his brothers. ""All right, you two?""

One of them, George Harry thought, nodded but the other just glared. ""What the hell, Ron?""

""Fred-""

""Slytherin? You're a slimy Slytherin?""

""I'm still me,"" Ron protested. ""And Slytherins aren't all that bad!""

Fred shook his head, face twisted in disgust, but George laid a hand on his arm. ""Are you sure you're all right?"" he asked. ""You were dead set on going into Gryffindor with us.""

Ron hesitated. He looked at Harry, who nodded, and took a deep breath. ""The Hat said I could do well in Slytherin, and - and I want people to know who I am!""

The twins looked as startled by the sudden outburst as Harry felt, but no one got a chance to say anything before Ron continued, ""I'm never gonna be as smart as Bill or Percy, or as good at Quidditch as Charlie, or as funny as you two, and Ginny's the first girl in generations, but now... People might look at me and see me, and not just another Weasley.""

Harry stared at him. Ron had mentioned that he felt overshadowed by his brothers, but he had never expected him to admit to his family. Ron looked at him again and gave a small smile. ""And I couldn't leave Harry alone with Malfoy for seven years.""

Harry couldn't suppress a snort. ""Thanks, mate.""

Fred and George exchanged a long look. Harry could feel Ron trembling next to him, and realised he had to say something. ""The other Slytherins, they're okay,"" he said. He flinched as both twins glared at him. ""I mean, some of them have weird ideas, but they're not all evil.""

""Not yet,"" Fred muttered, but George was frowning.

""You're not evil,"" he said to Harry. ""And you're a lot of things, Ron, but you're not evil either.""

Ron eyed him. ""Thanks?""

Fred scowled at them, but before he could say anything a strident voice echoed through the Entrance Hall.

""Ron!""

Ron somehow went even paler. Harry glanced round and saw Percy Weasley stalking across to join them, his expression thunderous. Ron flinched back and Harry shifted in front of him without thinking about it, but to their joint astonishment Percy whirled on the twins.

""I told you not to gang up on him!""

""We weren't,"" George protested, but Percy was in full flow.

""I know you, and I heard you talking last night, and I told you that I am not going to stand by and let you make him miserable for making a decision for himself!""

Ron was staring at his brother like he had never seen him before. ""Percy...""

Both twins had flushed. Fred was pointedly glaring at the floor, but George's expression was more thoughtful. Percy rubbed his eyes. ""If you can't be supportive, just go.""

Fred's scowl darkened, and he stalked off in the direction of the Entrance Hall. George hesitated. ""We don't hate you,"" he said to Ron. ""Really. It's just a shock, you know?""

He patted Ron awkwardly on the head and left before Ron could reply. Percy sighed. ""They'll come round. They were expecting you to come and be with us in Gryffindor, and you took them by surprise. You know how they hate that.""

""Yeah,"" Ron mumbled. He squinted up at his brother. ""Why'd you do it? Not that I'm not grateful, but...""

He trailed off with an awkward shrug. Harry kept quiet and paid close attention. From what he had seen and what Ron had told him of the Weasleys, Percy was acting the complete opposite to what he had expected. Percy looked at the two of them and sighed.

""Because you're not the first one to have been offered Slytherin as an option.""

Harry stared at him. Ron's eyes had gone very wide. ""You?""

His voice was a squeak. Percy gave them a tired smile. ""Ravenclaw too,"" he said softly. ""But I was too scared. I asked for Gryffindor and everything was fine, but sometimes I wonder...""

He shook himself and clapped Ron on the shoulder. ""You might be the bravest one of us all. And don't worry about Mum and Dad. I wrote to them last night, but I don't think you need to worry.""

""Thanks, Percy,"" said Ron. If his eyes were suspiciously wet, Harry didn't mention it. Percy smiled at them, nodded to Harry, and followed the crowds into the Great Hall. Ron gave a shaky breath and leaned against the wall.

""Huh. That was weird.""

Harry shifted from foot to foot. He didn't have much experience comforting upset friends, or friends in general, but he had to do something. ""Are you all right?""

Ron blinked up at him, and gave a slightly shaky smile. ""Yeah. I think so."" He took a deep breath. ""Thanks, mate.""

""Any time,"" said Harry quietly. Then his stomach rumbled and he blushed. ""Sorry.""

Ron's stomach gave an answering, and even louder rumble. Harry and Ron looked at each other, and burst out laughing.

""C'mon,"" said Ron, when they had both caught their breath. ""Let's go eat.""  

They entered the Great Hall in far better spirits than Harry had expected. Tracey and Daphne had left spaces for them, and Harry smiled at them as he sat down. Tracey glanced at him. ""How did it go?""

Ron paused loading his plate with everything on the table long enough to nod. ""Better than I expected. I dunno how Mum and Dad will take it, but..."" He shrugged and turned his attention to his breakfast. ""Mm, these sausages are great!"" 

He offered Daphne the dish, but she shook her head. ""No, thank you. I'm Jewish.""

Ron's ears went bright red. ""Ah, sorry.""

""It's fine, you didn't know,"" said Daphne, as she helped herself to more scrambled eggs. ""Harry hasn't had any yet though.""

Harry smiled when Ron immediately tipped three sausages onto his plate. The Dursleys had never let him eat this well. Tracey pursed her lips. ""Don't forget some fruit,"" she said. ""Don't take this the wrong way, Harry, but you look like you could use some vitamins.""

""Probably,"" Harry agreed. Dudley and Uncle Vernon hated vegetables and anything even vaguely healthy, and Petunia had never really tried to change their minds. He took an apple and a banana to go with the fried food Ron was still piling onto his plate and Tracey nodded.

""Good."" She paused. ""Sorry. My dad's a doctor.""

""A what?"" Ron asked with his mouth full. Daphne and Tracey gave him identical disapproving looks, and Harry frowned.

""You don't have doctors?""

""Of course we do,"" said Daphne, tearing her gaze from Ron. ""We call them Healers though.""

Harry and Ron both nodded, but further conversation was interrupted by Snape making his way down from the teacher's table. He was carrying a stack of parchment and started to hand them out to each student. Harry glanced round and saw that other teachers, including Professor McGonagall, were doing the same at the other three tables.

""Wonder what we'll have first,"" Tracey murmured. 

""Hopefully not History of Magic,"" said Daphne. ""I've heard the teacher is a terrible bore.""

Harry honestly didn't care what they ended up doing. Magical classes had to be more interesting than maths. Daphne accepted her timetable from Snape with a polite smile, but Snape practically threw Harry's and Ron's at them and swept on without even looking at them. Startled, Harry blinked after him.

""Huh,"" said Ron under his breath. ""Guess he really doesn't like us.""

""That's strange,"" said Tracey. She was too was frowning after Snape. ""He's our head of house.""

From a couple of seats down, Malfoy snorted. ""Perhaps he just has good taste. Honestly, a Weasley in Slytherin? It's a disgrace."" 

Ron's hands clenched on his timetable and Harry glared down at Malfoy, but the blond wasn't finished, ""And Potter?""

The venom rolled off Harry's back, he was very used to it after all those years with the Dursleys, but Ron lurched to his feet. ""I swear, Malfoy, one more word-""

""No,"" said Nott. He had been ignoring them from Ron's other side, but now he reached up and pulled Ron back down. ""I'm hereby extending our 'no fighting in the dormitory rule' to here as well. If nothing else you'll lose us house points.""

""He's got a point,"" said Daphne. ""If you must get even, do it where the teachers can't see.""

Ron scowled, but he stopped glaring at Nott. ""Fine,"" he growled. ""But if he doesn't learn to shut his mouth..."" 

He trailed off, still grumbling under his breath, and Harry let out a breath. He really didn't want a fight before they had even had their first class, but warmth had flooded his chest at the speed with which Ron jumped to his defence. No one had ever done that before. No one had ever been wiling to risk getting in trouble with Dudley on his behalf.

Before he could say anything else though, a swarm of owls made their way into the Great Hall. Harry gaped.

""What?""

Ron followed his gaze. ""What? Oh, owls carry the post, remember?""

Harry did, and rubbed the back of his head. ""Oh, yeah.""

It was still fascinating to watch. Harry had never seen so many owls in his life. Hedwig broke off from the pack to land next to him, and Millicent leaned over with a smile.

""She's beautiful, Harry.""

""I know,"" said Harry proudly, and received a fond nibble from Hedwig in return. He fed her a piece of bacon and she flew off again, then he realised that Ron was watching the birds with undisguised wariness. ""Ron? You okay?""

Ron started. ""Yeah. Just wondering if Mum and Dad have written - Oh.""

A grey Screech Owl was heading in their direction. Ron went white, and untied the letter from its leg with shaking fingers. The owl nibbled his finger and flew off to where Percy was sitting at the Gryffindor table, leaving Ron staring at the letter.

""You might as well get it over with,"" said Daphne, not unkindly.

Ron gave a jerky nod, and tore it open. He scanned it quickly, then his shoulders slumped and he let out a long breath. Harry nudged him. ""Okay?"" he asked again.

Ron gave him a shaky smile. ""They say they're surprised, but they want me to be happy,"" he said softly. 

""That's great,"" said Harry fervently. He remembered how kind Mrs Weasley had been when he was trying to find the platform. He was glad Ron wouldn't have to deal with any more of his family being upset with his Sorting.

Part of him wondered what his own parents would have thought. Hagrid had mentioned that they had both been in Gryffindor. Would they have reacted the way Fred did? Or would they have accepted it like Ron's parents had? 

Those were questions he would never know the answers to, and he wrenched his attention away in time to hear Ron make a soft noise.

""Ginny wrote something too.""

Harry had spotted the childish scrawl at the bottom of the page, but Ron continued before he could try to decipher it, ""She wants to know everything. Says she knows all about Gryffindor, but no one's ever been able to tell her anything about Slytherin.""

""Just as long as you don't give away all our secrets,"" said Tracey, with a grin. ""Tell her she can find out for herself next year.""

Ron huffed out a laugh. ""Could do. She's tough enough.""

He read the letter again, then tucked it carefully into his robes, but once again Malfoy had been listening.

""Merlin, no. One Weasley here is bad enough.""

""Shut up, Draco,"" said Nott, without looking up from his plate. Harry placed a restraining hand on Ron's arm when his friend's ears went red, but Ron visibly swallowed his anger and picked up his cutlery again. Malfoy's lip curled.

""Taking the Weasel's side, Nott? And here I thought you had a brain.""

""Funny, I thought you knew how to be subtle,"" Nott drawled. ""Looks like we were both mistaken.""

Harry ignored the bickering. After the Dursleys, Malfoy was nothing. Nott shook his head, and returned to his breakfast, and Ron stabbed irritably at his bacon. ""Git,"" he muttered.

Daphne rolled her eyes, but Tracey nodded. ""Get used to it,"" she murmured. ""He's not going to change any time soon.""

Harry sighed. It was going to be a long seven years.

Much to Daphne's dismay, their first class was indeed History of Magic. Harry had been startled and impressed when Binns arrived via the blackboard, but his interest died a quick death. He had never known a ghost could be so boring. He and Ron spent the rest of the lesson playing hangman while the rest of the class talked, dozed, or stared into the distance.

""That was a nightmare,"" said Ron, as they headed for Transfiguration. ""How's anyone supposed to take notes when he talks like that?""

""Told you,"" said Daphne, grimly. ""Just read 'A History of Magic' before the exams, and use the class to do homework.""

Fortunately, Transfiguration was much more interesting. It was as complicated as Harry had been expecting, but at least they got to use their wands, and no one would even dream of not paying attention to McGonagall. None of them had succeeded in turning their matchsticks into needles by the end of the lesson, but Tracey and Nott both earned points for making the most progress so that was something.

Harry was more than ready for lunch by the time the bell rang, but something had been niggling at him and he hesitated. Ron raised an eyebrow at him, and Harry shook his head.

""You go on,"" he said softly. ""I want to ask McGonagall something.""

Ron still looked confused, but he nodded. ""I'll save you a space.""

Harry watched him go, then took a breath and walked up to the front of the class. McGonagall peered at him over her glasses. ""Yes, Mr. Potter?""

Harry swallowed. McGonagall was almost as intimidating as Snape. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you,"" he said, before he could lose his nerve, ""about my parents.""

Whatever McGonagall had been expecting, it clearly wasn't that. Her eyes widened slightly, and Harry hurried to explain, ""My aunt and uncle never talked about them. I don't know anything about them except what Hagrid told me, but he mentioned that they were both in Gryffindor and as you're the Head of Gryffindor, I just thought, well...""

He trailed off, feeling his cheeks heat up, but McGonagall's severe expression had softened considerably. ""As it so happens, I knew your parents very well,"" she said softly. ""Both during their time at Hogwarts, and during the war."" She gave a slight smile. ""They were wonderful people, and very talented. Your father was one of the finest Transfiguration students I have ever had the pleasure of teaching, and your mother was a marvel at both Charms and Potions.""

Harry was hanging on her every word. Hagrid had told him a bit, but he wanted to know everything he possibly could. McGonagall shook her head slightly and refocused on him. ""Unfortunately I have a number of matters I need to attend to, but I will be available on Saturday morning.""

""That would be great!"" It came out a little fast, but Harry couldn't help himself. ""Thank you.""

McGonagall smiled at him. ""It would be my pleasure."" She paused. ""You might also want to talk to Professor Flitwick. Lily was considering pursuing an apprenticeship in Charms after the war.""

""I'll do that,"" said Harry. He hadn't had Charms yet, but he was looking forward to it. ""Thank you, Professor.""

""You are very welcome, Mr. Potter."" She straightened the papers on her desk and rose to her feet. ""Now, I suggest you head to lunch.""

Harry's stomach rumbled, and he blushed. ""Yes, Professor.""

He left the classroom with a spring in his step. So far, his life at Hogwarts was looking far brighter than the one he had left behind.

Harry really, really loved Hogwarts.

It was a lot to get used to, of course. Magical lessons were very different to those at his old primary school. Charms and Astronomy were a long way from Maths and English, and working in Aunt Petunia's garden hadn't prepared Harry in the least for the magical plants that Hogwarts had to offer.

Then there were the other students. The older Slytherins usually ignored them, which Harry honestly preferred over the looks and glares he got otherwise. The other houses weren't much better, and being stared at because his parents were murdered got old fast. The other first years weren't so bad, especially those who had grown up in the Muggle world like Harry, but they seemed wary of Slytherins in general.

Harry didn't see what their problem was. Yeah, the older students were scary, and Malfoy was a loud-mouthed prat, but the others? It was hard to be scared of Nott when he spent his evenings buried in a thick fantasy book, or find Millie intimidating when she played with her kitten in front of the fire every night. Pansy had a razor-sharp tongue, but she helped Crabbe and Goyle with their homework every night, no matter how many times she had to explain things, and Tracey and Daphne might be reserved in front of the rest of the school, but they taught Harry Exploding Snap and Gobstones and never once made fun of him for his ignorance.

And there was Ron. Ron was loud and brash and stubborn and the best friend Harry had ever had. Ron didn't have much, and he was nearly as lost in Slytherin as Harry felt, but he shared what he did have and he did his best to explain whenever Harry was lost in the world he was now part of, and he was loyal and kind and Harry was glad they were friends.

All in all, life at Hogwarts was far better than the one Harry had left behind.

Still, Harry was looking forward to his first weekend. It had been a long week of classes, and by the time Harry and Ron made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast on Friday morning they were all ready for a break.

""I can't wait for the weekend,"" said Ron, as he slumped onto the bench and started pouring out pumpkin juice. ""They don't believe in starting us off easy, do they?""

""We're here to learn, Weasley,"" said Nott. ""Just wait until we get to fifth year.""

Ron rolled his eyes, but Harry was more interested in the arrival of the post owls. He hadn't received any letters yet, but he hadn't been expecting any and it was nice to see Hedwig anyway.

It was something of a shock, therefore, when Hedwig swooped down with a note tied to her leg.

""Oh, look,"" Malfoy called. ""Someone finally wrote to Potter.""

""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Ron, without looking at him. ""Who's it from, Harry?""

Harry scanned the short note and smiled. ""It's from Hagrid. He's invited me to tea this afternoon.""

Warmth spread through his chest. He hadn't heard from Hagrid since his sorting, and he had been worrying a bit. Ron leaned over to look at the note.

""That's cool. Reckon it would be okay if I come along? Charlie really liked Hagrid.""

""I don't think he'd mind then,"" said Harry.

He scribbled his reply on the back of the note, fed Hedwig a piece of bacon, and sent her off again. ""It'll be nice to see him.""

Malfoy muttered something to Crabbe and Goyle, both of whom broke out into grunts of laughter, but Harry ignored him. He was getting very good at that. Daphne rolled her eyes, and Tracey passed over the jam with a sniff.

""We've got to get through Potions first,"" she reminded them. ""It should be interesting; Snape's supposed to be a good teacher.""

Ron snorted, then winced when both Tracey and Daphne frowned at him. ""Sorry, but I've heard different things from my brothers.""

""Of course you have,"" Nott drawled. ""They're Gryffindors.""

""So?"" Ron demanded. ""Shouldn't make a difference, should it? McGonagall doesn't treat us any differently than the Gryffindors.""

Nott just rolled his eyes and turned back to his porridge, but Harry frowned. ""Is that why Mo told us to read our Potions book last night?""

He had wondered why the Prefects had told them to work on a subject they hadn't even had yet, but if Snape was going to be a temperamental teacher then he was glad of the warning. Daphne quirked an eyebrow.

""Probably. He must expect us to set a good example. You heard him on the first night.""

Harry shivered. He hadn't spoken to Snape at all, but he hadn't forgotten how Snape had looked at them. At him. The last thing he wanted was to get on his Head of House's bad side.

With that in mind, the first-year Slytherins made sure to be waiting outside the dungeons in good time. The Gryffindors arrived soon after. They stayed on the other side of the corridor, their expressions wary, with the exception of Blaise Zabini. He had been talking quietly with Neville Longbottom as they came down the stairs, but he broke off to nod to the waiting group of Slytherins.

""Good morning.""

Daphne and Tracey returned the greeting, and Nott nodded as amicably as he ever did, but Malfoy's lip curled. ""Zabini,"" he said. ""Still here? I'd have gone home in shame.""

Harry frowned, but Zabini just quirked an eyebrow. ""Yes, well, you would know about being an embarrassment, wouldn't you, Draco?""

Malfoy spluttered, his pale cheeks flushing, but Zabini had already turned to Harry. ""Please excuse me. Draco and I have loathed each other since childhood.""

Ron snorted, and Harry grinned at him. ""I can't imagine why."" He held out his hand. ""Harry Potter.""

""I know,"" said Zabini, but the spark of amusement in his dark eyes as he shook Harry's hand eased any sting from his words. ""It's a pleasure to meet you."" Harry nodded, and he looked at Ron. ""Ron, right? I've met your brothers.""

Harry caught the odd note in his voice at the same time Ron winced. ""Sorry about that. They can be a bit, uh...""

He trailed off with a helpless shrug, and Zabini laughed. ""Yeah, that.""

Ron grimaced again, the tips of his ears blazing red, and from the other side of the corridor Hermione Granger sniffed. ""They have been very rude,"" she said. ""I still think you should talk to someone about it, Blaise.""

Zabini shot her a brief smile. ""They're only messing about. They'll get tired of it sooner or later.""

Hermione shook her head, and Ron's frown deepened. ""Sorry,"" he said again. ""I'll talk to them."" He pulled a face. ""Can't promise they'll listen, mind...""

Zabini shot him a long look, but even as he opened his mouth the door to the dungeons swung open. Hermione jumped and immediately hurried inside, and Zabini and Neville joined the rest of the Gryffindors trailing after her. Ron stepped forward, but Harry caught his arm.

""Why were you apologising?""

Ron hesitated, then shrugged. ""Told you, the twins can be a bit...sharp, I guess. If they like you they're great, but if they don't...""

He trailed off with another shrug. Harry frowned. ""But how did you know that they wouldn't like Zabini?""

Ron bit his lip, then shook his head. ""Tell you later. C'mon, we really don't want to be late.""

Now afire with curiosity, Harry followed him into the classroom. Most of their classmates had already taken their seats, the Gryffindors on one side of the room, and the Slytherins on the other, and he and Ron found a space near the back. Harry pulled out parchment and a quill, and finally looked to the front of the room.

Snape glared down at the class. His black eyes travelled slowly round the room, and Harry had to fight the urge to fidget. He hadn't interacted with his Head of House since getting his timetable, and he had no idea what to expect.

Snape rose to his feet, and Harry sat up straight. He got the feeling that not paying attention would be a very bad idea.

He was a compelling speaker. There was no denying that. Harry had liked the look of Potions when he first read through his books over the summer, but the way Snape spoke about it was something else. Snape had a knack for holding a class' attention, and his passion for his subject brought the rather dry pictures painted by the textbook to life.

""Potter.""

Harry jumped, startled by the sudden switch to animosity, but Snape didn't give him a chance to adapt, ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""

Hermione's hand shot into the air, but Harry could only gape. He hadn't been expecting a challenge straight away, and for a horrible moment his mind went completely blank, but then the hours Mo had spent with them the previous night came flooding back.

""Um, a sleeping potion? The, um, the Draught of Living Death,"" he clarified, when Snape's eyes narrowed.

The Potions Master continued to glare at him, and Harry had a sudden terror that he'd got it wrong, but Ron had relaxed and Tracey was grinning at him from the row in front. Hermione had put her hand down with obvious disappointment, but even as Harry let out a breath Snape's eyes narrowed.

""And where would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?""

That one Harry did remember, mainly for how disgusted Malfoy had looked when he learned it, and he was able to answer more confidently, ""The stomach of a goat, sir.""

He knew it was right, Zabini and Daphne were nodding along with Tracey, but Snape was still glaring as fiercely as ever. His lip curled as he met Harry's gaze, and for a moment his expression was so reminiscent of Aunt Petunia that Harry had to fight a shudder.

Snape twitched.

Only for a split-second, and so faintly that Harry was sure no-one else had spotted it, but something changed. Harry shook himself, and Snape switched his glare to the Gryffindors.

""Longbottom,"" he snarled. ""What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?""

Neville's face went white. He stared up at Snape in outright terror, and Harry's stomach clenched in sympathy. Hermione's hand was once again in the air, but Snape continued to ignore her in favour of his new target. Even from across the classroom Harry could see Neville trembling, but before he could work out what to do Zabini leaned over to bump his shoulder against Neville's.

Neville jumped, distracted from Snape's glare, and at Zabini's nod he seemed to find his voice. He mumbled something, and Snape's glower darkened.

""Speak up, boy.""

Neville took a shaky breath. ""They're-they're the same plant, sir.""

Snape blinked. Neville glanced at Zabini, and straightened a little at the other boy's smile. ""It's also known as aconite,"" he said.

Harry looked at Neville with new respect. He hadn't known that one, and he certainly hadn't known that it had yet another name. Judging from the startled faces around him, no one else had expected that from Neville either.

Snape, however, did not look impressed. He glared down at Neville with almost as much venom as he had at Harry, but even as Neville shrank back, Snape turned away with a twitch of his robes.

""I expect you all to maintain these standards.""

Harry shivered at the implicit threat, and resolved to study his Potions book until he knew it by heart. The last thing he needed was to give his head of house any more reasons to hate him.

Snape waved his wand and a set of instructions appeared on the board.

""You will be making a potion to cure boils. I trust you can all follow instructions?"" He glared down the people who dared nod, and continued, ""You should have the required ingredients. Proceed.""

Ron immediately started pulling ingredients out of his kit, but Harry caught his arm. ""Hang on, we should read it all first, so we know what we're doing. That's what I always do when I'm following a recipe,"" he added, when Ron frowned at him.

Ron shrugged. ""Fair enough."" He squinted at the board. ""Doesn't look too hard. You want to chop while I measure things?""

Harry relaxed a little as they set about their work. Handling Potions ingredients wasn't that different from food, and as antagonistic though he might be, Snape's instructions were clear and easy to follow. Snape himself paced the classroom, complimenting Malfoy and the other Slytherins and criticising the Gryffindors, but he passed by Harry and Ron without a word.

""He's starting to creep me out,"" Ron whispered, as Snape once again stalked past them. ""Our horned slugs look just as good as Malfoy's.""

Harry was opening his mouth to reply when there was a yelp from the front of the class. He looked up in time to see Zabini apologising profusely as he took some porcupine quills from Neville's shaking hand.

""Sorry, Neville, I didn't mean to startle you, but we need to take the cauldron off the heat first-""

""What is going on here?""

Neville jumped, but Harry saw Zabini flinch before it was hidden by his usual polite smile. ""Nothing, Professor. We're sorry to disturb the class.""

Snape's lip curled. ""I expected better of you, Zabini. A point each from Gryffindor for failing to read instructions properly.""

Zabini dropped his gaze to the floor. ""Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.""

Snape snorted and swept on. Ron let out a breath. ""Blimey. Doesn't let anything go, does he?""

Harry, who had seen Pansy stop Crabbe and Goyle for making far more stupid mistakes, gritted his teeth. ""Not if they're Gryffindors.""

""Git,"" Ron muttered, but he was careful to make sure Snape was out of earshot first.

Harry took a deep breath. The sooner they were done with this the better.

The rest of the class passed without incident. Harry and Ron double-checked every single line of the instructions before they did anything, and their potion ended up more or less the right colour and texture it should be, but Snape didn't even acknowledge them when they brought him a sample. Only once they had fled the classroom did Harry let himself breathe.

""That was different.""

""I'll say,"" Ron growled. ""What's his problem?""

Harry shook his head. He didn't know, but somehow he was going to find out.

His attention was diverted though when Neville and Zabini left the classroom. Both looked exhausted, and Harry shook his head as he passed.

""I think I'm glad the Hat didn't put me in Gryffindor.""

If Snape treated him this badly as a Slytherin, Harry dreaded to think what he'd have been like in any other circumstances. Zabini caught his eye, and pulled a face.

""Well, that was fun,"" he said. ""Can't wait to do it every week for the next five years.""

Harry snorted. ""Yeah, that was..."" He trailed off with a shrug. Neville shuddered.

""I'm sorry, Blaise,"" he said miserably. ""I did read the instructions, but he made me so nervous.""

""It's not your fault,"" said Zabini, in a tone that suggested he'd said it more than once since the accident. ""Other people made mistakes and he didn't snap at them.""

""I know I'm not going to be working near Goyle any time soon,"" said Ron. ""He'd have gassed us all if Pansy hadn't been there.""

Zabini smirked at him. ""Ah well, we survived. Hope there's something good for lunch.""

Harry kept an eye on Neville as they made their way up to the Great Hall. Zabini seemed to have shaken off Snape's venom, but Neville was still pale and downcast. Harry wracked his brain for something to take his mind off things.

""How's your toad, Neville?""

Neville blinked. ""He's...he's good. I have to keep him out of the shower now.""

""You really do,"" Zabini muttered. ""Seamus almost stepped on him yesterday.""

""He keeps getting away from me,"" said Neville with a sigh. ""I never knew toads could move that fast.""

Ron pulled a face. ""I'm lucky Scabbers is so lazy. I'd never be able to catch a rat.""

Harry smiled at the image, and Zabini chuckled. ""There are easier pets to handle.""

""You got that right,"" Ron muttered. ""Hedwig is brilliant."" Harry beamed, and Ron glanced at Zabini. ""Have you got any pets?""

""No,"" said Zabini, after a pause. ""My mother doesn't like animals."" His face twisted into a grimace. ""I was hoping to be able to talk her into it, but she's definitely not going to change her mind now that I'm a Gryffindor.""

""That's stupid,"" said Ron hotly. ""She's your mum. If mine can accept me as a Slytherin, yours can get over you being a Gryffindor.""

Zabini just looked down at his shoes. Harry was desperate to ask why even his mother thought Zabini should have been a Slytherin, but he swallowed the urge down. Zabini didn't look like he wanted to talk about it. Ron's frown deepened, but then they came out into the Entrance Hall and Neville grabbed Zabini's arm.

""We'd better find the others. See you later, Harry, Ron.""

""Bye,"" Harry called, as the pair vanished into the crowds. He stared after them, then turned to Ron. ""Okay, what's going on with Zabini?""

Ron ran a hand through his hair. ""It's, uh, a bit weird.""

""Everything here is a bit weird,"" said Harry flatly. ""Come on, Ron, I can't be the only one who doesn't know.""

""The Muggleborns probably don't know either,"" Ron muttered. ""Fine,"" he added, when Harry glared at him. He thought for a moment. ""Okay, does the Muggle world has people that, uh, everyone thinks they're kind of suspicious but no-one's ever accused them of anything?""

Harry frowned, then remembered some of Aunt Petunia's gossip and Uncle Vernon's comments on certain politicians and nodded. ""I suppose so.""

Ron shifted from foot to foot. ""Right,"" he mumbled. ""Thing is, Zabini's mum, she's been married a few times."" He paused. ""Five times, actually. And every time they die soon after.""

Harry put the pieces together and his jaw dropped. ""And people think she killed them all?""

It came out a little louder than he had intended, and Ron dragged him over to the side of the room. ""Keep your voice down,"" he hissed. ""No one knows for sure, or someone would have done something, but everyone says it's weird that every time she marries someone rich they die and leave her a lot of money.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. His stomach twisted uncomfortably. ""So people think that because his mum might have killed people, that he should be a Slytherin?""

Ron dropped his gaze. ""Yeah,"" he mumbled. ""Come on, Harry, you know Slytherins have a bad reputation, and even if she's not from here she's rich enough to know Malfoy and all the other pureblood families-""

""That's not the point! Why does everyone think Slytherin is just for evil people?""

Ron gave him a helpless shrug. Harry gritted his teeth. ""This is stupid,"" he fumed. ""Malfoy's a git, but everyone else has been fine. I don't know what's going on with Blaise's mum, but Blaise is nice enough."" He shook his head. ""It's stupid,"" he finished.

Ron stared at him for a long moment, then ran a hand through his hair. ""You're right,"" he said. ""It is."" He stared down at his shoes, then took a breath and looked up. ""And it's not fair.""

Harry's hands clenched into fists. He had spent years being hated for who he was. He wasn't going to spend the next seven years letting people think he was evil. He looked Ron straight in the eye.

""Maybe we can do something about that.""

Ron's eyes went very wide. He swallowed hard, then his jaw set and he nodded. ""I was going to prove it to Fred anyway. Might as well prove it to everyone.""

It took a moment for the words to sink in, and then warmth flooded Harry's chest. ""Thank you.""

Ron's beaming smile lit up the Entrance Hall. ""Any time."" He flung an arm around Harry's shoulders. ""C'mon. Can't fix the world on an empty stomach.""

Harry had to laugh.

Lunch was good, and even better with the knowledge that they were free from classes until Monday. Malfoy had continued to gloat about his performance in Potions, but Harry and Ron both ignored him. So did Daphne; she instead leaned over to talk to Harry.

""Have you spoken to Professor Snape at all, Harry?""

""Nope,"" said Harry in between bites of his lunch. ""Those questions in class were the first time.""

Daphne's frown deepened. Tracey looked up from her shepherd's pie. ""Are you sure you haven't offended him or something?""

""How can I have offended him when I've never spoken to him?""

The two girls shrugged. Ron washed a mouthful of food down with some pumpkin juice and straightened. ""Maybe you could ask Professor McGonagall tomorrow. Bill always said she was really helpful.""

""Maybe,"" said Harry quietly. He had a feeling that talking about his head of house with another teacher wouldn't go down very well. He sighed and turned back to his dinner. ""I'll think about it.""

Daphne pulled a face, but changed the subject. ""Do you have plans for the afternoon?""

""Homework,"" said Tracey promptly. ""I know,"" she said, when Ron choked on his pie, ""but I'd rather get it out the way now than have to do it over the weekend.""

Ron shuddered, and Harry grinned. ""We're going to visit Hagrid.""

""The gamekeeper, Potter? Really?""

""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Ron, without looking at him. ""He's better company than you.""

""You would say that, weasel,"" Malfoy sneered. ""You're used to associating with the servants.""

Ron started to lurch upright, face flushing, and Harry caught his arm. ""He's not worth it,"" he said firmly. ""Let's just finish eating so we can go and see Hagrid.""

Ron glared at Malfoy a moment longer, then sank back onto the bench. Tracey sighed. ""You can't let him get to you.""

""Easy for you to say,"" Ron muttered, then caught himself. ""Sorry.""

Malfoy muttered something that had Crabbe and Goyle breaking into snorts of laughter. Harry just rolled his eyes, and refilled Ron's and Tracey's goblets. Dudley had given him plenty of practice ignoring bullies, even if Malfoy was worse than Dudley had ever been.

They managed to finish lunch without further incident though, and Harry wasted no time dragging Ron out into the grounds. His friend was still fuming, but his mood brightened as they made their way down to Hagrid's hut.

""Charlie really likes Hagrid. Helps that they're both mad about dragons.""

Harry snorted. ""He said that he wanted one. I'd like to see one.""

""Me too,"" said Ron. ""Maybe one day.""

Harry smiled, but the closer they got to Hagrid's hut the more he was beginning to worry. Hagrid's words about all the bad witches and wizards who had come from Slytherin rang in his ears. He didn't want to think that Hagrid would turn against him, but having seen how people reacted to Slytherins he and to wonder.

Hagrid had been the first person to openly like him. Harry didn't want that to change.

""Harry?""

Harry blinked, and realised they were standing outside Hagrid's hut. His stomach clenched, but he took a deep breath and knocked on the door.

Almost immediately the sound of barking echoed from inside, and Hagrid's even louder voice sounded through the wood,

""Down, Fang, yer daft thing.""

Harry just had time to exchange a bemused look with Ron before the door swung open and Hagrid beamed down at him. ""Harry, good t'see yeh.""

Relief crashed over him, and Harry smiled back. ""You too, Hagrid. This is my friend, Ron.""

""Nice to meet you,"" said Ron. He was staring up at Hagrid with wide eyes, and staggered when Hagrid clapped him lightly on the back.

""Another Weasley, eh? I remember yer brothers. Come in, both o' you.""

They entered, and Hagrid waved them to chairs so tall they went both left swinging their feet while he made tea. Fang turned out to be an enormous boar hound that slobbered over both of them before flopping down into a giant basket.

""How are yeh findin' Hogwarts?"" Hagrid asked. ""Classes all right?""

""It's brilliant,"" said Harry. ""It's a lot to learn, but everyone's been great. Most people anyway,"" he amended, when Ron snorted.

Hagrid gave him a knowing look as he set down the mugs. ""Slytherin, eh? That was somethin' else.""

Harry gave a slightly awkward shrug. Next to him, Ron shifted in his chair. Hagrid looked at the two of them, and his smile faded. ""Yer both stayin' safe there?""

""They're not all evil,"" Harry pointed out. ""Most of them are fine.""

""Maybe now,"" said Hagrid dubiously. ""But you mind the older'uns. Some of those kids...""

He trailed off, shaking his head. Harry thought about saying that he was sure he had more to fear from Snape than any of the students, but Hagrid was already moving on,

""Be careful, Harry. Yer both fine, but a lot of Dark Wizards did come from Slytherin.""

""But not all of them,"" Ron spoke up. ""What about Sirius Black?"" He shuddered. ""He was as Dark as they come.""

""Who's Sirius Black?"" Harry asked, but before Ron could answer Hagrid abruptly straightened up.

""Death Eater. Real bad'un, but he's safe in Azkaban. Don' you worry about that, Harry.""

Harry opened his mouth to ask why he needed to he told not to worry about Black when he was safe in Azkaban, but Hagrid had already turned to Ron. ""How's Charlie gettin' on? He ever get to go out t'Romania?""

Ron launched into an excited account of Charlie's successful application, and how much he was enjoying his work, and Harry sat back. Hagrid's reaction had been weird. Plenty of people had been telling him about Death Eaters since he had got to Hogwarts, and no one had shut down like that.

There was something going on. It didn't look like Hagrid was going to tell him, but that was fine. If nothing else, living with the Dursleys had taught Harry patience.

""That was fun.""

Harry smiled. Hagrid hadn't said another word about Death Eaters, but the visit had been fun despite that. He and Ron had got on well, and while Hagrid hadn't exactly seemed pleased about their sorting he wasn't against it. It was about as good as Harry could have hoped for.

Neither of them had been able to manage Hagrid's rock cakes though, and both their stomachs were rumbling as they made their way into the Entrance Hall. Harry saw the rest of the first-year Slytherins filing into the Great Hall up ahead, but just as he and Ron made to follow them a voice echoed through the hall.

""Ron.""

Ron froze. Harry glanced round and one of the twins came running up. He shot quick look at Ron, but though his friend paled, he managed a nod of greeting.

""George. You all right?""

George nodded. He was quiet for a moment as he looked Ron over, but just as Ron was starting to shift from foot to foot George cleared his throat. ""Yeah. Yeah, you?""

Ron shrugged. ""Fine.""

George nodded again. Harry looked between the two of them. He didn't have siblings, and had no idea what was going on, but neither of them looked like they were having fun. George finally coughed and folded his arms.

""Anyone giving you problems?""

""You mean apart from Fred?""

George flinched, and Ron ducked his head. ""Sorry,"" he muttered, but George shook his head.

""No, it's... Yeah."" He bit his lip. ""Ron, look, I know I've been a bit of a shitty brother.""

He paused. Ron's jaw dropped before he snapped it shut. George gave a weak huff. ""Was sort of hoping for a disagreement there. I know,"" he said, when Ron started to open his mouth, ""I've been thinking. Even before all this...""

He broke off shaking his head. Ron still looked like he couldn't believe what he was hearing, but George continued before he could say anything else, ""I'm sorry. Percy was right. Don't tell him that,"" he added quickly. Ron snorted, and George managed a quick grin before his expression turned serious again. ""You're my brother. Doesn't matter what house you're in.""

Ron's blue eyes were very bright. He tried to speak, coughed, and tried again. ""That's... Thanks.""

George ruffled his hair quickly and stepped back. ""Yeah, well. It's true. I just wanted to make sure you knew.""

He started to turn away, then paused. ""And I'll get into Fred's thick head one way or another. It just...might take a while.""

He vanished into the crowd before Ron could say anything else. Ron stared after him until Harry nudged him.

""Are you okay?""

Ron sniffed. ""Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine."" He scrubbed a hand over his face, and smiled at Harry. ""Thanks, mate.""

Harry smiled back. ""Any time.""

As pleased as he was for his friend though, Harry couldn't keep his thoughts from drifting back to their chat with Hagrid. There was something he wasn't being told about Sirius Black, and Harry was going to find out what."

Just as Harry was reaching for a pack of something called Chocolate Frogs the door to their compartment slid open. The pale boy from Diagon Alley was standing in the entrance, his trunk at his feet and an Eagle owl in a cage in his hand.

""I've been kicked out of my compartment and this is the only one left with space, so I'll be joining you,"" said the boy, dragging his trunk in and storing it in one of the corners. He set his birdcage down next to Hedwig's and cleared a space next to Harry for him to sit down on.

Ron glared at the other boy and Harry looked between them, confused.

The blond boy extended his hand to Harry.

""Malfoy, Draco Malfoy,"" he introduced himself. Harry took the hand and shook it.

""Harry,"" he said. ""Er, Potter,"" he added nervously. Draco's grey eyes went wide but otherwise, his face remained the same. Ron cleared his throat and Draco glanced over at him. His eyes swept over Ron and a sneer pulled at his lips.

""No need to ask who you are. My father told me all Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.""

Harry snatched his hand from Draco's grip and the other boy turned back to him.

""You shouldn't say that, you don't even know him,"" Harry told Draco, eyes narrowed.

Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.

""I'd apologize if I were you,"" he continued, more bravely than he felt because even though Draco was their size, he was far more intimidating.

""Malfoy's don't apologize,"" he sneered. ""Especially not to filthy poor blood-traitors like Weasley.""

Ron stood up, then Draco did, and then Harry stood between them.

""You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there,"" Draco told Harry.

""I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,"" he said coolly.

Draco went pink again.

""Listen, Draco, you're stuck in here with us, right?"" asked Harry. Draco nodded slowly. ""Then you should try to be nice, at least for the rest of the trip,"" he looked behind him at Ron. ""And that means you too, Ron.""

Both boys sent each other one last nasty look before sitting back down.

""What are these?"" Harry asked Ron, holding up the pack of Chocolate Frogs he had been reaching for before Draco arrived. ""They're not really frogs are they?"" he was starting to feel nothing would surprise him. Draco scoffed.

""No,"" said Ron. ""But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.""

""What?""

""Oh, honestly Potter, don't you know anything? Chocolate Frogs have cards in them of famous Witches and Wizards,"" explained Draco, haughtily.

""Of course he wouldn't know Malfoy, he's been living with Muggles,"" snapped Ron. ""Lot's of people collect the cards. I've got about five hundred cards, but I haven't got any Agrippa or Ptolemy.""

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.

""So this is Dumbledore!"" said Harry.

""Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!"" said Ron. ""Can I have a frog? Might get Agrippa - thanks -""

Harry turned his card over and read:




ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS


Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.

""He's gone!""

""You can't expect him to hang around all day, Potter,"" Draco rolled his eyes. ""He'll be back though.""

""Oh, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.""

Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. Harry noticed Draco's eyeing the pile of sweets as well.

""Help yourselves,"" said Harry. ""But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.""

""Do they? What, they don't move at all?"" Ron sounded amazed. ""Weird!""

""Muggles are quite strange,"" commented Draco, taking a bite out of a licorice wand.

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards and Draco mostly just glanced at them before deciding whether to keep them or not, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, when Draco made a strangled noise that might have been a choked off laugh.

""I've got you!"" he said, holding up a card and passing it over.

Sure enough, a baby version of Harry was blinking up at himself with his large green eyes. His lightning scar was a brighter red against his younger self's brown skin and was only barely covered by his black fringe.

He flipped the card over and read the back:




HARRY POTTER
THE BOY WHO LIVED


Known by many as The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter is the only known survivor of the Killing Curse and is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard You-Know-Who on October 31st, 1981 when he was only a year old. Harry Potter is the son of James Potter and Lily Potter nee Evans, who were tragically killed by You-Know-Who the night he was defeated, leaving young Harry orphaned.

Harry swallowed and tried to ignore the tears pooling behind his eyes.

""Do my parents have cards?"" he asked after a moment.

""Yeah, but they're really rare,"" answered Ron.

""I've got them,"" Draco announced. Harry looked over at him and caught his eyes before Draco turned to his trunk. ""I suppose I could give them to you, if you'd like."" He pulled out a large leather book and flipped toward the back. He pulled out two cards and handed them over. Harry looked down at the proffered cards them back up at Draco.

""Thank you,"" he said, voice choked with emotion as he took the cards from Draco.

""It's no problem. I didn't want them anyway.""

""Thank you,"" he stressed, clutching the cards to his chest. This gave Draco pause and his disinterested mask slipped for a second. He smiled hesitantly at Harry, who smiled in gratitude back.

Harry looked down at his new cards and studied his parents' faces eagerly.

His mother was a kind looking redhead with the same startlingly green eyes that he saw in the mirror, though her pale, slightly freckled skin appeared a more natural pair to the color, unlike his own brown skin. Her hair just brushed her shoulders and as he watched she tucked a strand behind her ear. She looked over toward where he was holding his father's card and smiled. Harry found himself following her gaze.

Looking at his father was like looking in a mirror. They shared the same perpetually messy black hair, the same russet skin, the same nose, even the same smile. The only difference between the two was that his father lacked his scar and had brown eyes underneath his round glasses, not green.

Harry didn't bother reading the backs of the cards, content with just seeing their faces. His mother disappeared for a moment and when she came back she was holding his one-year-old self. His father crowded in next to her soon after, the family squeezing into the small frame provided by the card. Harry smiled sadly at the picture of what could have been.

""Would you like a bean?"" Draco asked, snapping Harry away from his family. Harry realized he had been crying and swiftly wiped at his cheeks.

""Yeah, thanks,"" he said as he reached for the box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

""You want to be careful with those,"" Ron warned Harry. ""When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.""

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully and bit into a corner.

""Bleaaargh - see? Sprouts.""

Harry, Ron, and Draco had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Draco made a game of trying to guess whether the bean was a good flavor or a bad one. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end of a funny grey one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.

By the time the world outside the train was woods and dark green hills they had finished most of the sweets and had told a round-faced boy they hadn't seen his toad.

""Honestly, I would've chucked a toad as soon as I could, I don't know why he's trying to find his,"" said Draco.

""I would've done the same. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk,"" said Ron.

The rat was still snoozing in Ron's lap.

""He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,"" said Ron in disgust.

Ron told them about a spell he tried to turn to rat yellow, and a bushy-haired black girl came in asking about the lost toad. After Ron's spell didn't work she babbled about getting her letter and, after Harry, Ron, and Draco introduced themselves, about the books Harry was in. She left after stating her desire to be in Gryffindor or Ravenclaw and advised them to change into their robes.

""Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,"" said Ron. He threw his wand back in his trunk. ""Stupid spell - George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.""

""What House are your brothers in?"" asked Harry.

""Gryffindor,"" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. ""Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.""

""That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?""

""That's not to say it's a bad House,"" said Draco. ""My whole family has been in Slytherin, except a cousin on my mother's side. I'll be in Slytherin too, most likely.""

""Yeah, but Slytherin's are evil, everyone knows that,"" said Ron. Draco regarded him with narrowed eyes.

""Merlin was a Slytherin, and everyone believes him to be one of the greatest wizards to ever live,"" he retorts. Ron goes nearly as red as his hair.

""Well, yeah, but-""

""And Gryffindor's aren't all good. Sirius Black was a Gryffindor and look what happened to him,"" said Draco.

""Who's Sirius Black?"" asked Harry. Draco and Ron stopped and looked over at him, both suddenly uncomfortable. Scabbers seemed to have woken up at the sound of the name and was quivering in Ron's lap.

""He was a Death Eater, one of You-Know-Who's lot, that killed a bunch of Muggles and was sent to Azkaban - that's wizard prison,"" explained Ron.

""They say he was the Dark Lord's closest follower,"" continued Draco.

""And he was a Gryffindor?"" asked Harry. The other two boys nodded. ""I guess neither is all everyone says they are,"" said Harry, thinking of all those books he's in. ""We'll stay friends, right? No matter what House we're in.""

""Of course,"" said Ron.

""Well... as long as it's not Hufflepuff,"" said Draco. Ron snorted a laugh in agreement.

They continued the ride in comfortable conversation. Harry asked about Ron's eldest bothers and Ron and Draco explained Quidditch to him, pausing here and there to argue over teams, and Hermoine came back to tell them to change into their robes again. This time the three boys listened. Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. Draco's and Harry's were both brand new, though Draco's did seem slightly better than Harry's, despite them getting them in the same place.

A voice echoed through the train: ""We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.""

Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. Only Draco looked unbothered, though Harry thought he must be just as nervous. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: ""Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?""

Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

""C'mon, follow me - any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!""

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

""Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,"" Hagrid called over his shoulder, ""jus' round this bend here.""

There was a loud ""Oooooh!""

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

""No more'n four to a boat!"" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Hermione joined Harry, Ron, and Draco in their boat, much to Draco and Ron's displeasure.

""Everyone in?"" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. ""Right then - FORWARD!""

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Harry could have sworn he saw a tentacle breech the surface and wave at him, though no one else seemed to have noticed. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer the cliff on which it stood.

""Heads down!"" yelled Hagrid as the boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out on to rocks and pebbles.

""Oy, you there! Is this your toad?"" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.

""Trevor!"" Cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.

""Everyone here? You still got yer toad?""

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.

I have nothing against Hufflepuffs, though there does seem to be an anti-Hufflepuff sentiment in Hogwarts students.

 The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.

""The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,"" said Hagrid.

""Thank you Hagrid. I will take them from here.""

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursley's house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones in Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led up to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right - the rest of the school must already be here - but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. Draco stood close to Harry's side and as Harry looked around he could see a group of mean looking students staring at them curiously, that is, except for two hulking boys that were more interested in the sweets they were eating than anything else. The small brunette girl in front sneered at Harry and Draco, though her sneer was nowhere near as good as Draco's was.

""Welcome to Hogwarts,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have class with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.

""The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House had its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points,"" Professor McGonagall's sharp eyes seemed to glance over and linger on Harry as she said the words. ""At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.

""The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few moments in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.""

 Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged noise. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.

""I shall return when we are ready for you,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""Please wait patiently.""

 She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. The dark-haired girl and her hulking lackeys walked up to Harry, Ron, and Draco.

""Malfoy, what are you doing talking to a Weasley?"" she demanded. Draco went pink.

""None of your business, Pansy,"" he grumbled. Pansy pursed her lips.

""You should know better than to associate with filth like them,"" she said, her eyes roaming down to Ron's short robes. ""Their poor might be contagious.""

Ron went red and was almost about to say something before Harry beat him.

""Draco can choose his friends for himself, thank you very much. He doesn't need you trying to control him.""

Pansy's eyes flickered over to him, ""And who are you?""

""Harry Potter.""

""Well, well, I suppose the rumors were true. The famous Harry Potter at Hogwarts! I suppose we should all bow down and give you our eternal thanks for vanquishing the Dark Lord,"" she laughed.

Harry felt the eyes of the others on his back now, and he tensed.

""Leave him alone, Pansy!"" Draco snapped.

Pansy huffed and stormed away, her lackeys following. Harry swallowed again and glanced at the people staring at him, though they all turned away when he caught their gaze. He flicked his eyes to Draco and Ron.

""How exactly do they sort us into Houses?"" he asked.

""Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking,"" answered Ron.

""Don't be daft, Weasley! They wouldn't give us a test, we don't know anything yet,"" said Draco, rolling his eyes. ""My father refused to say how they sorted us, but I am sure it involves some sort of magic.""

Ron grew red at his words, but the rest of the gathered first years stopped their terrified whispering. Soon, though, they all worked themselves back up, muttering about what the Sorting Ceremony entailed. It seemed as though none of them knew what to expect. Hermione was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which ones she might need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been so nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursley's saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He nearly flinched just at the memory. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.

 Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air - several people behind him screamed and Draco gripped his arm.

""What the - ?""

 He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: ""Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance - ""

""My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?""

A ghost wearing a ruff and tights has suddenly noticed the first years.

Nobody answered. Draco's hold on his arm got tighter.

""New students!"" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. ""About to be Sorted, I suppose?""

A few people nodded mutely.

""Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!"" said the Friar. ""My old House, you know.""

Draco snorted quietly beside him and Harry nudged him in the ribs.

""Move along now,"" said a sharp voice. ""The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.""

 Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.

""Now, form a line,"" Professor McGonagall told the first years, ""and follow me.""

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind Ron, with Draco behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. The tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up there, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns interspersed with slightly darker shades in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, ""It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.""

""My father never told me how breathtaking the ceiling was,"" Draco whispered in awe.

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool, she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing - noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth - and the hat began to sing:

""Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
But don't judge on what you see,
I'll eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me.
You can keep your bowlers black,
Your top hats sleek and tall,
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.
There's nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can't see,
So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave of heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart;
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
If you've a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin
You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
And don't get in a flap!
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
For I'm a Thinking Cap!""

The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.

""So we've just got to try on a hat!"" Ron whispered to Harry. ""I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.""

""Your brothers make me glad I'm an only child, Weasley,"" Draco commented.

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.

""Friends regardless of House, right?"" asked Harry, looking at his first two friends. They both nodded in agreement.

 Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.

""When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,"" she said. ""Abbott, Hannah!""

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which feel right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause -

""HUFFLEPUFF!"" shouted the hat.

As soon as the words left the hat, Hannah's robes changed. The left breast pocket gained a yellow and black patch and the insides of the sleeves turned the same bright yellow.

The table second from the left cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

And so it went. ""Bones, Susan"" became a Hufflepuff. ""Boot, Terry"" was the first Ravenclaw and he went to sit at the second table from the right, his robes turning blue inside and a blue and bronze patch appearing on his breast pocket. ""Brocklehurst, Mandy"" joined him, but ""Brown, Lavender"" became the first Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers cat-calling. Their robes were red inside and their patches had gold.

""Bulstrode, Millicent"" then became a Slytherin with green robes and a green and silver patch. Draco tensed beside him and Harry frowned at the unpleasant group at the table on the far right.

Harry was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

""Finch-Fletchy, Justin!""

""HUFFLEPUFF!""

Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others, it took a little while to decide. ""Finnegan, Seamus,"" the sandy-haired boy next to Ron in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.

""Granger, Hermione!""

 Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.

""GRYFFINDOR!"" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR,"" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to ""McDougal, Morag.""

""Malfoy, Draco!""

Draco glanced at Harry and smiled.

""No matter what, yeah?"" he said, walking backward. Harry nodded. ""Hope I see you in Slytherin.""

Draco swaggered forward and put on the hat. After a minute the hall began to whisper. After two the teachers began giving each other strange looks. Harry felt his stomach twist into knots after the third minute when he noticed Draco clenching the wooden stool in his hands.

Finally, after nearly five minutes, the hat shouted out ""GRYFFINDOR!""

The entire Great Hall was silent. Draco stood slowly and set the hat back on the stool before slowly making his way toward the Gryffindor table. He looked nearly as pale as the ghosts and he seemed to tremble with every step. From behind him, Harry heard a man's voice say: ""Well, this is very serious, isn't it Minerva."" Harry turned and saw Dumbledore looking at Professor McGonagall with twinkling blue eyes. The Scottish professor tutted and shook her head. Harry turned back and saw that Draco had barely made it halfway to the table.

 Suddenly someone from the Gryffindor table began clapping and soon everyone joined in, even some people from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables, though the Slytherin table remained silent. Draco sped up and sat as far away from the rest of the House as possible.

 There weren't many people left now.

""Moon""..., ""Nott""..., ""Parkinson, Pansy,"" was the dark haired girl that was glaring and Draco and him earlier who was sorted into Slytherin, then a pair of twins girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil""..., then ""Perks, Sally-Anne""..., and then, at last -

""Potter, Harry!""

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

""Potter, did she say?""

""The Harry Potter?""

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.

""Hmm,"" said a small voice in his ear. ""Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes - and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting... So where shall I put you?""

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

""Not Slytherin, eh?"" said the small voice. ""Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that - no? Well, if you're sure - better be GRYFFINDOR!""

Harry heard the hat shot the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shaking toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the twins yelled, ""We got Potter! We got Potter!"" Harry sat down across from Draco. The ghost with the ruff he'd seen earlier glided over and patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest to him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he's gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.

And now there were only four people left to be sorted. ""Thomas, Dean,"" a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry and Draco at the Gryffindor table, sitting on Draco's left. ""Turpin, Lisa,"" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table, though it was unnecessary for as soon as the hat touched Ron's red hair it had shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR!""

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed down into the chair on his left.

""Well done, Ron, excellent,"" said Percy Weasley pompously across Neville as ""Zabini, Blaise,"" was made a Slytherin. Draco flinched. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.

 Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

""Welcome!"" he said. ""Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

""Thank you!""

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.

""Is he - a bit mad?"" he asked no one in particular.

""Mad?"" said Percy Weasley airily. ""He's a genius! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?""

Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so much food on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, curries of all kinds, Tandoori chicken, naan bread, dishes he only recognized through pictures he had found on Indian cuisine at his school's library, strange soup with meatballs in it, packages that seem to be wrapped in leaves, several tofu dishes, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, chips, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some reason, peppermint humbugs.

The Dursleys rarely gave Harry enough to eat, and certainly never anything Indian. Had there ever been anything Harry had shown even the slightest of interest in eating, Dudley had always taken it, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with generous helpings of anything he found appetizing, even taking one of the leaf packages when he discovered they were filled with rice. It was all delicious. Harry reveled at the new spices that the Dursley's would have never let near their bland foods.

Draco, he noticed, had only small portions of the under-seasoned English food on his plate, though he was eyeing the strange soup and noodle dishes. Harry nudged them over toward Draco's side of the table. The blond looked up at him with wide eyes.

""Go on, help yourself,"" said Harry, nodding at the dishes. Draco hesitantly portioned them onto his plate and took a bite. He smiled widely.

""It's better than Mother makes it!"" he proclaimed. Draco quickly unloaded his unappetizing English food onto Ron, who happily accepted it, and instead piled his plate with the other strange dishes. He even took a bowl of soup.

""What is it?"" asked Harry.

""Bun bo Hue,"" he pointed to the soup. ""Com tam,"" he pointed to a rice dish. ""Goi cuon,"" he pointed to the summer rolls. ""They're Vietnamese.""

""You're Vietnamese? My primary school teacher was half-Vietnamese,"" Dean commented from Draco's left.

""Only a quarter. My mother was half but my father is English. We used to go to Great Aunt Walburga's house to celebrate Tet. Father didn't like it, so mother and I went alone. Mother wanted me to be aware of my ancestry,"" said Draco.

""Wish I could've had someone to teach me about being Indian,"" Harry said. ""Sounds like that would have been fun.""

His new housemates went silent around him, none of them really knowing how to respond to the reminder that Harry was an orphan.

The ghost in the ruff glided over to them looking rather miffed from a conversation he had just been having with Hermione and the Weasley twins.

""So - new Gryffindors! I must say there hasn't been a Sorting this exciting since Sirius Black came to Hogwarts! Dreadful thing he did to his poor friends, especially that nice Potter boy, though I must say I did have my suspicions of him right from the start. I mean, a Black in Gryffindor? Unheard of!"" the ghost looked around spotted Draco staring down at his com tam. Then his ghostly eyes flickered over to Harry and he seemed to grow impossibly paler. ""Er, well, I don't think I've introduced myself; my name is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. I do hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone this long without winning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable - he's the Slytherin ghost.""

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was sitting right next to the Parkinson girl who, Harry noted, didn't look pleased with the seating arrangements.

""How did he get covered in blood?"" asked Seamus with great interest.

""I've never asked,"" said Sir Nicholas delicately.

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs, small doughnut-type things, a dark jelly-like dish, rice balls floating in something, something that looked a bit like peanut brittle with a lot more nuts, jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...

As Harry helped himself to the doughnut-type things and a scoop of ice cream that Draco informed him was cardamom flavored, the talk turned to their families.

""I'm half-and-half,"" said Seamus. ""Me dad's a Muggle, mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.""

The others laughed, but Draco looked uncomfortable.

""What about you, Neville?"" said Ron.

""Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,"" said Neville, ""but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me - he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned - but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Aunt Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced - all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here - they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.""

""That's terrible!"" Dean said. ""Your Great Uncle Alfie nearly killed you!""

""What about you, Dean?"" Seamus asked.

""Muggleborn. Mum and Dad were so relieved when the letter came and McGonagall made her visit. I was doing magic for a while, making my pictures move and all that, and they thought they were going insane.""

""McGonagall visited?"" asked Harry. ""She didn't come for me.""

""You're not Muggleborn, though,"" said Draco.

""Might as well been,"" said Harry. ""My aunt and uncle wouldn't even let Dudley read books with magic in them.""

Harry looked away from the looks his housemates were giving him and turned to the High Table. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore intensely, though the older wizard just smiled and nodded a few times, eating his dessert. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.

It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes - and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.

""Ouch!"" Harry clapped a hand to his head.

""What happened?"" asked Draco.

""N-nothing.""

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look - a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.

""Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"" he asked Draco. The blond craned his neck and followed Harry's gaze.

""You mean Sev- er, Professor Snape?""

""Yeah, you know him?""

""He's my godfather. He's the Potions professor and Head of Slytherin,"" said Draco.

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.

""Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.

""First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.""

Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.

""I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

""Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.

""And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not which to die a very painful death.""

Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

""He's not serious?"" he muttered to Ron.

""Must be,"" said Ron, shrugging. ""Percy might tell us why later, surely he told the Prefects.""

""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he were trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

""Everyone pick their favorite tune,"" said Dumbledore, ""and off we go!""

And the school bellowed:

""Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us things worth knowing,
Bring back what we've forgot,
Just do your best, we'll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot.""

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped the loudest.

""Ah, music,"" he said, wiping his eyes. ""A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!""

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of more food than he's probably ever eaten at once. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.

""Peeves,"" Percy whispered to the first years. ""A poltergeist."" He raised his voice, ""Peeves - show yourself.""

A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.

""Do you want me to go get the Bloody Baron?""

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.

""Oooooooh!"" he said, with an evil cackle. ""Ickle Firsties! What fun!""

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.

""Go away Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!"" barked Percy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.

""You want to watch out for Peeves,"" said Percy, as they set off again. ""The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.""

At the end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.

""Password?"" she said.

""Caput Draconis,"" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it - Neville needed a leg up - and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.

Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of the spiral staircase - they were obviously in one of the towers - they found their beds at last: four four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Dean, Neville, and Seamus found their trunks in the room one floor down, but Harry, Ron, and Draco had to keep going up until they had found theirs. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. Ron took the bed closest to the door, Harry next to him, Draco the one next to him, and they left the bed closest to the bathroom empty.

""Great food, isn't it?"" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. ""Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing through my sheets.""

Harry was going to ask Ron if he had any of the treacle tarts, but the redhead had already fallen asleep.

""Draco?"" whispered Harry, turning to address the curtains of the other bed.

He got no response, so he thought Draco had already fallen asleep.

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him to transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin: it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully - and there was Parkinson, laughing at him as he struggled with it - then Parkinson turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold - there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke the next day he didn't remember the dream at all.

Sorry about the delay in updates! Holidays and school kept me busy, so I couldn't update as soon as I wanted!

This chapter has scenes from the second book because I felt that Harry's reaction to Howlers would be the same, even if it happened a year earlier.

I might not be able to update very soon because I have Midterms coming up, along with a lot of other work, and the next chapter will not be taken from the books.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy! Hopefully the next chapter will be ready soon,but I can't make any promises!

""There, look.""

""Where?""

""Next to the tall kid with the red hair.""

""Wearing the glasses?""

""Isn't that Draco Malfoy with him?""

""Did you see his face?""

""Did you see his scar?""

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid wall just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.

The ghosts didn't help either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick, as he was apparently sometimes called, was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with pits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, ""GOT YOUR CONK!""

Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry, Ron, and Draco managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of here, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.

And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.

They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouse behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff-room fire and got up the next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he got to Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.

""Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,"" she said. ""Anyone messing around in my class will have to leave and not come back. You have been warned.""

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, was given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that is was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.

Harry was very relieved to find that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron and Draco didn't have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for the three Gryffindor boys. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

""What have we got today?"" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

""Double Potions with the Slytherins,"" said Ron. Draco winced and ducked his head.

""Professor Snape is Head of Slytherin House. He tends to favor his House and hates Gryffindor,"" said Draco. He looked over and caught Harry's eye. ""You did the reading like I told you, right?""

""You were there when I did it, Draco.""

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly stemmed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.

Hedwig hasn't brought Harry anything yet. She sometimes flew in to nibble on his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:

Dear Harry,
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so should you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
Hagrid

Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.

Harry turned back to his friends with a smile, only to find Draco staring up toward the ceiling. Harry turned to look where Draco's gaze was directed and saw a large Eagle Owl flying overhead. It dropped a red envelope on the plate in front of Draco and flew back out the window with barely a pause.

Draco stared down at the letter and swallowed heavily. Ron was looking at it as though he expected it to explode.

""What's that?"" asked Harry.

""That's a Howler,"" said Ron faintly.

""What's a Howler?"" Harry asked, without answer.

Harry and Ron watched as Draco hesitantly reached for the slightly smoking envelope. His hands shook as he fumbled with the opening, and the longer it took for him to open it, the more it smoked. Ron shoved his fingers into his ears the moment Draco ripped open the envelope, and Harry understood why a split second later. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.

""-DARE YOU CALL YOURSELF OUR SON? YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A DISGRACE! HOW COULD YOU SULLY THE MALFOY NAME IN SUCH A WAY-""

What one could only assume was Mr. Malfoy's voice yelled, a hundred times louder than what should be possible. It made the plates and spoons rattle on the tables and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, though it seemed obvious from the message being broadcast to the whole school. Draco steadily grew pinker and pinker as the message went on.

""-ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL! AND TO THINK I HAD TO LEARN OF YOUR BETRAYAL FROM NOTT! THE EMBARRASSMENT YOU HAVE CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND I WITH THIS FOOLISHNESS! YOUR POOR MOTHER HAS LOCKED HERSELF AWAY IN SHAME! SHE BELIEVES YOUR ABHORRENT BEHAVIOR IS HER FAULT AND NOT ENTIRELY YOUR DOING! YOU WILL CONVINCE DUMBLEDORE TO PUT YOU IN SLYTHERIN WHERE YOU BELONG! I WILL NOT TOLERATE A GRYFFINDOR AS A SON!""

A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Draco's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. Draco stared down at the small pile of ash. A few laughs carried over from the Slytherin table, steadily growing louder.

Harry stood and turned toward the green table. Ron stood beside him and they took a step forward, only to stumble back. Draco's hands gripped their sleeves tightly.

""Don't.""

Harry and Ron sat back down slowly, though they kept throwing dirty looks over their shoulders at the Slytherins.

It was lucky Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. Other than his parents being murdered, of course.

At the start of term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry - he hated him.

Potions lessons took place down one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started class by taking roll. He sneered when he called Draco's name and, like Flitwick, paused at Harry's name.

""Ah, yes,"" he said softly, ""Harry Potter. Our new - celebrity.""

Parkinson and her friend Crabbe and Goyle, as Draco informed him, sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.

""You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making,"" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word - like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without any effort. ""As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as big a batch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.""

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows and when Harry glanced at Draco the pale boy smirked and rolled his eyes. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.

""Potter!"" said Snape suddenly. ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""

Powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? Harry glanced at Draco, who raised his eyebrows and nodded at him; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.

""Er, is it the Draught of Living Death, sir?"" said Harry.

Snape's lips pursed. Hermione's hand sank back to her desk.

""Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?""

Hermione's hand rocketed back into the air, stretched as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry knew what a bezoar was. He remembered Draco explaining it to him last night as they studied.

""A goat's stomach, sir.""

Snape frowned further and his eyes narrowed. Hermione huffed as she lowered her hand again.

""What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?""

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretched toward the dungeon ceiling.

""There isn't one, sir,"" Harry said confidently. ""It's the same plant, sir, which I'm sure Hermione could have told you if you had tried her.""

A few laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.

""Sit down,"" he snapped at Hermione. ""For your information, Potter, you are correct. Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are indeed the same plant, which also goes by the name aconite. Well, why aren't you all copying that down?""

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, ""And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.""

Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Zabini, whom he seemed to like. Draco frowned down into the potion he and Harry were brewing, which was ignored by Snape despite the textbook perfect way it was being brewed. Harry was taking the cauldron off the fire when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

""Idiot boy!"" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. ""I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?""

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.

""Take him up to the hospital wing,"" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Draco, who had been working next to Neville.

""You - Potter - why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.""

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him from where he was standing behind him at his and Dean's cauldron.

""Don't push it,"" he muttered, ""I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.""

""And you,"" Snape snapped, turning toward Draco, ""I would've thought a Malfoy would know better. But then, what should I have expected from a blood-traitor like yourself? No better than that filthy cousin of yours. Another point from Gryffindor.""

Draco remained silent, though his jaw was tight and his hands were curled into white-knuckled fists.

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon gown an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week - why did Snape hate him so much? Who exactly was Draco's cousin?

""Cheer up,"" said Ron, ""Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?""

""Yeah, all right. Draco, do you want to come with?""

Draco curled his lips at the mention of the large man, some prejudice left over from his family. He was opening his mouth to refuse when a group of laughing first year Slytherins bumped into them. His shoulders deflated and the sneer fell off his face. He sighed and nodded his head.

At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.

When Harry knocked on the door they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks that made Draco jump. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, ""Back, Fang - back.""

Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.

""Hold on,"" he said. ""Back, Fang.""

He let them in, struggling to keep hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.

""Make yerselves at home,"" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears while Draco looked on in disgust. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.

""This is Ron,"" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.

""Another Weasley, eh?,"" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. ""I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.""

""And this is Draco,"" Harry continued, looking over at the blonde boy.

""Lucius Malfoy's son?"" asked Hagrid, frowning. Draco jutted his chin forward.

""Not anymore. Lucius Malfoy won't have a Gryffindor as a son,"" he muttered. Hagrid's face softened.

""Oh, it'll be alright! 'Specially with Harry an' Ron here with yeh! Why, Siri-"" Hagrid cut himself off and his face clouded over. ""Well, it's happened before, an' they got through it with their friends, so don't yeh worry!"" he said as he offered them the plate of rock cakes.

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but the boys pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.

The trio of boys were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch ""that old git.""

""An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.""

Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.

""But he seems to really hate me.""

""Rubbish!"" said Hagrid. ""Why would he?""

Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.

""How's yer brother Charlie?"" Hagrid asked Ron. ""I liked him a lot - great with animals.""

Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While the others discussed Ron's brother's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:





GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST



Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied that same day.
""But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,"" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.

Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.

""Hagrid!"" said Harry, ""that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!""

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, tracking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?

As Harry, Ron, and Draco walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?

Oh my God I am so sorry. I know I said it would be a while between updates but I swear I had no idea it would take so long.

Midterms kicked my ass so I couldn't really write. Then I had to write all of this off the top of my head, which always means it takes me forever. On top of that for some reason, this scene just didn't want to go the way I wanted so I've had to rewrite it about fifty thousand times and even then I'm not super happy about it. And finally, I had a shit ton of projects given to me by my teachers ON TOP OF having to do work on my Graduation Project, which if I don't do well on it I won't be able to graduate.

So I'm really sorry about how long it's taken to get this chapter out. Also sorry it's so short.

Harry was still awake long after the rest of the castle had fallen asleep that night. His mind couldn't seem to stop working. He thought about his classes, and Professor Snape, and the break-in at Gringotts, and Draco Malfoy. At that moment, Draco Malfoy was the most pressing thought in his mind. Perhaps it was because he could hear the sounds of someone muffling their tears from his bed. He turned onto his side so he was facing Draco's bed. Both of their curtains were open and Harry could almost make out a fuzzy lump on his bed that might have been the pale-haired boy.

""Draco? Are you awake?"" Harry whispered. He wasn't sure if the other boy could hear him over the sounds of Ron's snores.

""What?"" hissed Draco. His voice was congested with the tears he had been shedding.

Harry didn't really know what to say. He hadn't thought this far ahead.

""Did you want something Harry?"" asked Draco, his voice still soft so he wouldn't wake up Ron. Harry thought they could shout at the tops of their lungs and not wake up Ron.

""No. Er, not really. I just couldn't sleep,"" Harry explained weakly. He watched Draco's still form and berated himself for bothering his friend. He turned away from Draco and stared instead at Ron's bed, though the view wasn't that interesting due to Ron's closed curtains.

Someone crawled onto his bed and Harry jumped in surprise before he realized it was Draco. It was hard to see him in the dark, but his nearly white hair practically shone in the dim light of the waxing crescent moon.

Harry shifted over and sat up, reaching blindly for his glasses on his bedside table. He slid them on and the few things he could see focused. Draco reached over and closed the curtain between them and Ron, then tugged the one on the other side closed as well. Harry's bed was shrouded in darkness immediately.

""Lumos,"" Draco whispered and the tip of his wand lit up with blue light. Harry hadn't even realized he brought his wand with him.

""Professor Quirrell hasn't taught us that spell yet,"" he said.

""I was raised with magic, Harry. My parents made sure I knew something before they sent me off.""

Harry said nothing in response, simply stared at Draco in the wand's pale light. The whites of his eyes were rimmed with red and slightly puffy. Harry didn't comment on it.

""Well?"" Draco asked, one brow raised. Harry looked down and then at Draco's wand.

""What was it like being raised by wizards?"" Harry asked. Draco looked away and the light on his wand wavered slightly.

""I suppose it was fairly normal,"" Draco shrugged. ""What was it like being raised by Muggles?""

Harry thought of his cupboard. He thought of the Dursley's calling him a freak. He thought of Dudley's old clothes. He thought of the neighbors that sneered at him or praised the Dursley's for taking in the 'poor little orphan' despite his brown skin.

""Fairly normal.""

The two boys sat in silence, contemplating the lies they just told each other. Neither called the other out on them, of course.

""Why'd it take so long for you to be Sorted?"" Harry asked after a few minutes of silence.

""Why did you take so long?"" Draco asked back.

""I asked you first,"" said Harry. Draco frowned at him.

""I'll answer if you do,"" he finally decided.

""Alright. You first.""

Draco sighed and looked away.

""It's called a Hat Stall, when the Hat takes a while like that. It happens when the Hat can't decide where to put you, when it's stuck between two options,"" Draco looked down and fiddled with his wand, the light flickering slightly. ""The Hat knew exactly where to put me as soon as I put it on.""

""Did it want to put you in Slytherin?"" Harry asked. Draco's head snapped up and he glared at him.

""No. And don't interrupt,"" he snapped. ""The Hat wanted to put me in Gryffindor. But I argued against it. I told it I was a Slytherin, through and through, but the Hat didn't listen to me. It said 'my true heart belonged in Gryffindor',"" Draco sneered at the words and shrugged. ""That's all. Now, what about you?""

Harry chewed on his lip in thought, deciding how to explain his experience with the Hat.

""Well, uhm, the Hat wasn't sure where to put me at first, then it said I would do well in Slytherin,"" he shrugs. ""I chose Gryffindor.""

""Of course you did,"" Draco sneered. Harry frowned at him and crossed his arms in front of him.

""What's that supposed to mean?"" he demands.

""Perfect Potter, the Boy Who Lived, of course, he would choose to be in Gryffindor with all the other brave little heroes,"" Draco scoffed with derision.

""You're in Gryffindor too, you know!"" Harry pointed out, keeping his voice low. ""And it's not like I knew about all this when I was choosing, I didn't have some grand pureblood upbringing like you or Ron! Maybe I just wanted to be in the same House as my friend!""

Draco stared at him with wide grey eyes and the light from his wand flickered slightly.

""I keep forgetting you were raised by Muggles,"" Draco spit the word from his mouth like poison.

""Wish I could do the same,"" Harry mumbled to himself. The two boys sat in silence for a brief moment, surrounded by the blue glow from Draco's wand.

""Do you miss them?"" Draco asked. ""Your parents, I mean.""

""Dunno. I never really knew them,"" he shrugged.

""Do you remember anything about them?""

Harry remembered a green light and a women's scream.

""No.""

Harry picked up his pillow and hugged it to his chest. Draco's eyes found the three cards resting on the bed where the pillow was. Harry followed his gaze and flushed, picking up the cards. The light showed the sleeping faces of James and Lily in their separate cards, baby Harry's tiny face slack and drooling in sleep resting in the crook of his mother's arms.

""I'm sorry you never got to know them,"" Draco whispered.

""Thanks,"" Harry whispered back. They both ignored the tears gathered in Harry's eyes.

""You know, a lot of the professors have been here for a really long time,"" Draco started, ""I'm sure some of them remember your parents. You could ask them about them. If you wanted to, of course.""

Harry looked up in surprise and smiled at Draco.

""You think?""

Draco shrugged, ""I don't see why they wouldn't.""

Harry launched himself at Draco and hugged him tightly. The blond tensed and held himself still as Harry wrapped him in his arms.

""Thank you,"" Harry whispered.

""Er, it was no trouble, Harry. I, erm, suppose we should go back to bed, then,"" Draco carefully removed himself from Harry's embrace. He whispered 'nox' and the light at the end of his wand went out.

""G'night then, Draco,"" Harry yawned, realizing only then just how tired he was.

""Goodnight, Harry,"" Draco whispered back.

Harry set his glasses back on his nightstand and put his pillow back, the cards with his family on them underneath, and finally went to sleep.

Perhaps it was due to his conversation with Draco, but that night Harry dreamt about the Dursleys.

He was back in his cupboard under the stairs and he could hear Uncle Vernon and Dudley in the living room watching telly. There was a knock on the door and Uncle Vernon called for him to open it, but Harry found himself unable to move. Aunt Petunia's heels clicked on the floor as she went to answer it. Harry watched through the open grate in his door, his vision limited though it was, as she opened the door.

There was a high, cold laugh and then a flash of green light. As Aunt Petunia crumpled to the ground, her tight black bun fell into shoulder length red hair, and a scream died before it left her throat. A dark figure glided down the hallway and passed his door. Harry looked out and saw Professor Snape, though he was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban. Snape turned toward the living room, but the next thing Harry knew his door was wrenched open and a wand was being pointed at him. It was as white as a bone and filled Harry with fear. When he looked into the living room it wasn't Vernon and Dudley he saw, but Ron and Draco. He looked by the door where his Aunt lay, but found his mother and father there instead. His head looked wildly about and found Hermione on the stairs, Dean and Seamus on the other end of the hallway, Fred and George by the kitchen door. He turned back to Snape and found the Bloody Baron grinning back at him. It turned Harry's stomach. The Baron lifted the bone white wand and pointed at him. There was a flash of green light and -

Harry woke up gasping for breath, sweat dripping down his forehead. His scar ached slightly and he winced as he put his hand to it. He blearily rubbed his eyes and turned over, closing his eyes and hoping for more sleep.

He fell back to sleep moments later and when he woke the next day the nightmare was only a faint memory.

Harry had never believed he would meet someone he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Pansy Parkinson. Still, the first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Parkinson much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday - and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.

""Typical,"" said Harry darkly. ""Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Parkinson.""

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

""You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,"" said Ron reasonably.

""Doesn't matter anyway,"" interjected Draco, ""Pansy's a rubbish flyer. Blaise is alright though, I've played Quidditch with him a few times at home. Not as good as he's been saying,"" Draco rolls his eyes and shrugs, ""but he's still good.""

It seemed as if flying was all the first year pure- and half-blood students could talk about, each of them bragging about how good they were at flying. The way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Draco had a tendency to spout long rambling narratives about how he would race around the Malfoy Manor and its grounds, though each of them seemed to end with his narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters, so Harry learned to take his stories with a grain of salt. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he's almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from Wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas about football. Ron couldn't see what was so exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. That wasn't to mention the week that Ron and Draco wouldn't talk to each other after they insulted the other's favorite Quidditch team.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book - not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday, she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Parkinson had been quick to notice, of course. Parkinson's owl was always bringing her packages of sweets from home, which she opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. Draco continued to receive Howlers from his father and the occasional letter from his mother. He was quick to destroy the Howlers before they could erupt, but he always saved the letters from his mother, which Harry often found him reading in their dormitory later.

A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.

""It's a Remembrall!"" he explained. ""Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red - oh..."" His face fell because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, ""... you've forgotten something...""

Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten, scratching at his bare head and ruffling his fine blond hair, when Pansy Parkinson, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet, though Draco just dropped his head and stayed seated. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Parkinson, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.

""What's going on?""

""Parkinson's got my Remembrall, Professor.""

Scowling, Parkinson quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

""Just looking,"" she said, and she slipped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind her.

""Longbottom, I suggest you go put your hat on before classes start,"" McGonagall commented before she walked away. Neville's hands went to his blond head, which was indeed bare of his pointed wizard's hat before he leapt from the table and dashed off toward the doors.



At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, Draco, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns towards a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always few slightly to the left.

Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.

""Well, what are you all waiting for?"" she barked. ""Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.""

Harry glanced down at his broomstick. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.

""Stick out your right hand over your broom,"" called Madam Hooch at the front, ""and say 'Up!'""

""UP!"" everyone shouted.

Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron giggled when Draco flushed after she told him he'd been doing it wrong for years. Their friend glared at them, but they all knew it was all in good fun. What really amused the trio was when Parkinson tipped over sideways and fell off her broom.

""Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,"" said Madam Hooch. ""Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two -""

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.

""Come back, boy!"" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle - twelve feet - twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -

WHAM - a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.

Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.

""Broken wrist,"" Harry heard her mutter. ""Come one, boy - it's all right, up you get.""

She turned to the rest of the class.

""None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.""

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Parkinson burst into laughter.

""Did you see that great lump's face?""

The other Slytherins joined in.

""Shut up, Parkinson,"" snapped Parvati Patil.

""Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?"" said Parkinson. ""Never thought you'd like fat little cry-babies, Parvati.""

""Look!"" said Blaise Zabini, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. ""It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.""

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.

""Give it here, Zabini,"" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.

Zabini and Parkinson looked at each other, then both smiled nastily.

""I think Blaise should leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find,"" she said.

""Like up a tree,"" Zabini finished.

""Give it here!"" Harry yelled, but Zabini had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. Draco hadn't been lying when he said Blaise could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, ""Come and get it, Potter!""

Harry grabbed his broom.

""No!"" shouted Hermione Granger. ""Madam Hooch told us not to move - you'll get us all into trouble.""

Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him - and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he found something he could do without being taught - this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron and Draco.

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Zabini in midair. Zabini looked stunned.

""Give it here,"" Harry called, ""or I'll knock you off that broom!""

""Oh, yeah?"" said Zabini, trying to sneer but looking worried.

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot forward toward Zabini like a javelin. Zabini only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.

""No Slytherins up here to save your neck, Zabini,"" Harry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Zabini.

""Catch it if you can, then!"" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down - next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball - wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching - he stretched out his hand - a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.

""HARRY POTTER!""

His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.

""Never - in all my time at Hogwarts -""

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ""- how dare you - might have broken your neck -""

""It wasn't his fault, Professor -""

""Be quiet, Miss Patil -""

""Blaise started -""

""Not now, Mr. Malfoy -""

""But Zabini -""

""That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.""

Harry caught sight of Parkinson, Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. Draco was still railing against Pansy and Blaise as he walked away, which made him feel a warm gratitude toward his friend but didn't stop the sinking in his stomach. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? What would Vernon do when he came back early?

Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still, Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stomped around on the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.

""Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?""

Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?

But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused.

""Follow me, you two,"" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.

""In here.""

Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.

""Out, Peeves!"" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.

""Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood - I've found you a Seeker.""

Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.

""Are you serious, Professor?""

""Absolutely,"" said Professor McGonagall crisply. ""The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. What that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?""

Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.

""He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,"" Professor McGonagall told Wood. ""Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.""

Wood was now looking as if all his dreams had come true at once.

""Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?"" he asked excitedly.

""Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,"" Professor McGonagall explained.

""He's just the build for a Seeker, too,"" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. ""Light - speedy - we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.""

""I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks....""

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses as Harry.

""I want to hear you're training hard, Potter or I may change my mind about punishing you.""

Then she suddenly smiled.

""Your father would have been proud,"" she said. ""He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.""



""You're joking.""

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron and Draco what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. Draco had very nearly spit out his canh chua when Harry told them he had been made Seeker and was now staring at him with his mouth hanging open.

""Seeker?"" he said. ""But first years never - must be the youngest House player in about -""

""- a century,"" said Harry, shoveling aloo matar into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ""Wood told me.""

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.

""When do you start training?"" asked Draco, leaned forward across the table.

""Next week,"" answered Harry. ""Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.""

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.

""Well done,"" said George in a low voice. ""Wood told us. We're on the team too - Beaters.""

""I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,"" said Fred. ""We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.""

""Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new passageway out of the school.""

""Bet it's the one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week.""

""Or the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we found after we got the map,"" George added as the twins left.

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Parkinson and Zabini, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

""Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?"" Zabini asked, a practiced sneer on his face.

""You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,"" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.

""He could take you on anytime on his own,"" said Parkinson. ""But I'd rather do it myself. Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only - no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?""

Ron bristled beside Harry, no doubt ready to come to his defense, but this time Draco beat him to it.

""Don't be ridiculous, Pansy, of course, I've taught him about wizard's duels. I'm his second, who's yours?""

Parkinson looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. Evidently finding them wanting she turned to Zabini.

""Blaise,"" she said. ""Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.""

When Parkinson was gone, Ron and Harry looked at Draco.

""What is a wizard's duel?"" said Harry. ""And what do you mean, you're my second?""

""I'm there in case you die,"" said Draco casually, starting in on his cold canh chua again.

""What are you thinking Malfoy!"" Ron demanded. Draco looked up and caught the look on Harry's face.

""Oh, not to worry though, Harry, nothing will happen. Only proper wizards ever die in duels, anyone younger than a fourth year doesn't know any spells that can do a lot of damage. The most you and Parkinson will do is throw a few sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough to do any harm. She probably expected you to refuse, anyway."" Draco tried to reassure him.

""And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?""

""Throw it away and punch her in the face,"" Ron suggested.

""Excuse me.""

They all looked up. It was Hermoine Granger.

""Can't a person eat in peace in this place?"" said Ron.

Hermoine ignored him and spoke to Harry.

""I couldn't help overhearing what you and Parkinson were saying -""

""Bet you could,"" Ron muttered. Draco scoffed.

""- and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.""

""And it's really none of your business,"" said Harry.

""Goodbye,"" said Ron. Draco smiled and waved at her dismissively.



All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay in one of the large, over-stuffed chairs in the common room listening to Dean and Seamus bickering over the merits of Quidditch versus football, as well as commenting on the excitement of the flying lesson (Neville still wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron and Draco were still nattering on about the different spells he could use, and had repeatedly given him advice such as 'If she tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it because I can't remember how to block them.' There was a very good chance that they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt that he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. Although, he thought, if he did die in the duel at least he wouldn't have to go back to the Dursleys.

Percy finally sent them all to bed, but Harry couldn't find it in himself to actually sleep, too strung up with nerves to even consider closing his eyes. Even still, Parkinson's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Parkinson face-to-face. He couldn't miss it

""Half-past eleven,"" Draco muttered at last, ""we'd better go.""

They pulled on their bathrobes and picked up their wands, lingering for a half-second in the tower room. Ron had passed out at some point, and they weren't sure whether they should wake him or not. While there was a good chance that Parkinson would bring Crabbe and Goyle along with Zabini, it would also be easier to sneak out of the tower with only two people, instead of three. The two looked at each other and came to a silent agreement to let Ron sleep. They crept down the spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor common room. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, ""I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.""

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

""Granger!"" whispered Draco furiously. ""Go back to bed!""

""I almost told Ron's brother,"" Hermione snapped, ""Percy - he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.""

Harry couldn't believe someone could be so interfering.

""Come on,"" he said to Draco. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.

Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Draco through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.

""Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.""

""Go away.""

""All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so -""

But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing the empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.

""Now what am I going to do?"" she asked shrilly.

""I suppose that's your problem,"" said Draco. ""We've got somewhere to be, and we're going to be late.""

They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.

""I'm coming with you,"" she said.

""You are most certainly not.""

""D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.""

""The nerve -""

""Shut up, both of you!"" said Harry sharply. ""I heard something.""

It was a sort of snuffling.

""Do you think it's Mrs. Norris?"" inquired Draco, scarcely breathing and squinting through the dark.

It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.

""Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get into bed.""

""Keep quiet!"" hissed Draco, casting furtive glances down the hallway.

""The new password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.""

""How's your arm?"" said Harry.

""Fine,"" said Neville, showing them. ""Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.""

""Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later -""

""Don't leave me!"" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, ""I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already.""

Draco huffed and threw his hands up, turning and walking back down the corridor. He stopped about halfway and turned back to them, glaring and pointing at Hermione and Neville.

""You can come with, but if either of you gets us caught I'll hex you both so hard your great grandchildren will feel it,"" said Draco.

Hermione huffed and opened her mouth to protest, but stopped herself when they all heard the sound of the portrait hole creaking open.

""Harry? Draco? Are you out there?""

The group turned together and watched as Ron climbed out of the Gryffindor entrance.

""HOLD THE DOOR!"" they all shouted as one, but it was too late. The portrait swung closed before Ron could realize what they were saying.

""Great going Weasley, now there's even more of us to get caught by Filch,"" Draco said.

Ron opened his mouth, perhaps to tell Draco off, but Harry hissed at him to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.

They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn, Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.

Parkinson and Zabini weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the dots at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Parkinson leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.

""She's late, maybe she's chickened out,"" Ron whispered. Draco sucked in a sharp breath.

""Or she's set us up!"" Draco whispered back.

A noise came from the other room and made them jump. Harry only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak - and it wasn't Parkinson.

""Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.""

It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris.

""Run,"" whispered Draco then grabbed Harry's hand and waved madly at the others to follow them as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped around the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.

""They're in here somewhere,"" they heard him mutter, ""probably hiding.""

""This way!"" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run - he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

""RUN!"" Harry yelled, and the five of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following - they swung around the rooftops and scalloped down one corridor then another, Harry and Draco in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going - they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near the Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.

""I think we lost him,"" Harry painted, leaning the cold wall and wiping his forehead with one hand. It was then he realized he and Draco were still holding hands. The two boys blushed, dropped each other's hand, and looked away from the other. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.

""I - told - you,"" Hermoine gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, ""I - told - you.""

""Yes, thank you, Hermione,"" said Draco, rolling his eyes.

""We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,"" said Ron, ""quickly as possible.""

""Parkinson tricked you,"" Hermione said to Harry. ""You realize that don't you? She was never going to meet you - Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Parkinson must have tipped him off.""

""I think we managed to work that out for ourselves, thanks,"" said Draco.

""Let's go,"" said Harry, sighing.

It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.

""Shut up, Peeves - please - you'll get us thrown out,"" Harry begged.

Peeves cackled.

""Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty!""

""Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please,"" Harry tried again.

""Should tell Filch, I should,"" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but with his eyes glittering wickedly. ""It's for your own good, you know.""

Draco put out his arm to stop Ron, who looked one second away from trying to fight Peeves, and stepped forward.

""But Peeves, if you tell Filch, that'll make him happy. You don't want to make Filch happy, do you?""

Peeves paused and pondered this for a bit.

""Suppose I don't, Ickle Blood-traitor. But what will the Ickle Firsties do for Peevsie? Not as clever as the last ones, but more of you. Used to be four but now there's more!"" Peeves descended into giggles at that.

""I've had enough of this. Get out of the way!"" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves - this was a big mistake.

""STUDENTS OUT OF BED!"" Peeves bellowed, ""STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!""

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor when they slammed into a door - and it was locked.

""This is it,"" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, ""We're done for! This is the end!""

They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could towards Peeves' shouts.

""Oh, move over,"" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, ""Alohomora!""

The lock clicked and the door swung open - they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.

""Which way did they go, Peeves?"" Filch was saying. ""Quick, tell me.""

""Say 'please'.""

""Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?""

""Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,"" said Peeves in his annoying dungeon voice.

""All right - please.""

""NOTHING! Haha! Haaaaaa!"" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.

""He thinks this door is locked,"" Harry whispered. ""I think we'll be okay - get off, Neville!"" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. ""What?""

Harry turned around - and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare - this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.

They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.

They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between the ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.

Harry groped for the doorknob - between Filch and death, he'd take Filch - only to find another hand already on it. He turned and caught Draco's eye, who nodded.

""On three, get ready to run. One. Two. Three!""

They fell backward - Draco slammed the door shut and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared - all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor, who was luckily back in her portrait.

""Where on earth have you all been?"" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

""Never mind that - pig snout, pig snout,"" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward - though not without the Fat Lady grumbling to herself about young Gryffindors and their fathers. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.

""What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"" said Ron finally. ""If any dog needs exercise, that one does.""

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.

""You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?"" she snapped. ""Didn't you see what it was standing on?

""The floor?"" Harry suggested. ""I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.""

""No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.""

She stood up, glaring at them.

""I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could have all been killed - or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.""

Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

""She needs the sort out her priorities,"" he said.

""Honestly, you'd think we dragged her along,"" Draco mumbled.

But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide - except perhaps Hogwarts.

It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.

Sorry for not updating sooner! A friend of mine borrowed my Harry Potter books before going off to college and she only just came back for winter break to give them to me, so I couldn't update for a while.

Parkinson couldn't believe her eyes when she saw that Harry and Draco were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry, Draco, and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled his two friends in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.

""It's either really valuable or really dangerous,"" said Ron.

""Or both,"" said Harry.

""Probably both,"" said Draco.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much of a chance of guessing what it was without further clues.

Neither Neville not Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.

Hermione was now refusing to speak to the three boys, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Parkinson and Blaise, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall, as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky because it said:



DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand,
but I don't want everybody knowing you've got
a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood
will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at
seven o'clock for your first training session.


Professor M. McGonagall


Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note across the table for Ron and Draco to read.

""A Nimbus Two Thousand!"" Ron moaned enviously. ""I've never even touched one.""

""Well, of course, you haven't,"" Draco scoffed, ""I'm getting one next year, if they haven't come out with a new one, father promis-""

Draco trailed off, accompanied by a look of dawning horror.

""Draco?"" asked Harry.

Draco bolted from his seat at the table and rushed to the door. Harry and Ron both sprung up to follow, Ron grabbing the broomstick on his way. They were halfway across the entrance hall when they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Parkinson seized the package from Ron and passed it to Zabini, who felt it and smirked.

""That's a broomstick,"" he said, throwing it back to them with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.

""Yeah,"" Harry snapped, craning his neck around Crabbe and Goyle's lumbering forms.

""Think that because you're the Boy Who Lived you get special privileges, Potter? First years can't have brooms, you know,"" said Parkinson.

Ron couldn't resist it.

""It's not any old broomstick,"" he said, ""it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Zabini, a Cleansweep Seven?"" Ron grinned at Harry. ""Cleansweeps are good, but no match for the Nimbus.""

""What would you know about it, Weasley? You couldn't raise enough money to even touch one,"" Zabini snapped back.

""Your little family of blood-traitors and muggle-lovers probably have to save up twig by twig,"" Parkinson sneered.

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Parkinson's elbow.

""Not arguing I hope?"" he squeaked.

""Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,"" said Parkinson quickly.

""Yes, yes, that's right,"" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. ""Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?""

""A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,"" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Parkinson and Zabini's faces. ""And it's really thanks to Zabini here that I've got it,"" he added. ""If you'll excuse us, Professor, we really need to get back to our dorms.""

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, Ron smothering his laughter at the Slytherin duo's obvious rage and confusion. Harry just wished he could enjoy it more, but he was worried about Draco.

""I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking the rules, then?"" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.

""I really don't have time for this, Hermione,"" groaned Harry.

""Weren't you not speaking to us? Don't stop now, it's doing us so much good,"" said Ron.

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

""Come on, we've got to get to Draco,"" said Harry, walking steadily back to the dorms.

Draco wasn't in the common room, nor was he in their dormitory when Harry went up to stash his Nimbus under his bed. The fifth-year studying in the common room said she hadn't seen him since they left for breakfast, and by then they didn't have time to keep looking, or they'd be late for double Potions.

Draco was, of course, waiting for them in Snape's classroom when they arrived. Though his eyes seemed a little redder than normal, he showed no signs that this morning was anything other than normal.

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. Occasionally it would take a quick jaunt to wonder why Draco had suddenly left that morning and where he'd gone. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then grabbed Draco and Ron to rush upstairs and unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

""Wow,"" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. Draco watched it with keen eyes, though he remained quiet and refused to meet either Ron or Harry's eyes.

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.

Harry glanced from Draco, who had settled on his bed with his History of Magic textbook, to the clock, which showed that he had fifteen minutes to get to the Quidditch field. He bit his lip and glanced at Draco again before snatching up his broom and running out of the dorm. He drew more than a few looks as he ran out of the castle with his Nimbus clutched in his fist, though by now he was used to people looking at him all the time.

He'd never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except they were fifty feet high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.

""Hey, Potter, come down!""

Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.

""Very nice,"" said Wood, his eyes glinting. ""I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.""

After Wood explained to him about Chasers, Keepers, Quaffles, Bludgers, Beaters, Seekers, and the Golden Snitch, and after they had practiced with golf balls until it got too dark, Harry helped Wood pack up.

""Um, Wood?"" Harry asked, squinting at his shoes in the dark.

""Something wrong?"" Wood replied.

""Not really, it's just that I was wondering what happened to your other Seeker? I mean, you must've held tryouts since your last Seeker graduated, and I was thinking that it can't be very fair to whoever tried out for the spot, me getting it like I did. Then I started wondering if me getting the spot had to do with me being, well, Harry Potter, and not being the best person for the spot. Especially since I've never even been on a broom until yesterday,"" Harry shrugged and gripped his broom tightly. Wood rested his hand on Harry's shoulder firmly, if a bit awkwardly.

""Harry, I didn't have a new Seeker yet. We held tryouts, yeah, but none of them could perform like I needed. That's why McGonagall brought you to me because she knew I was still looking for someone to take Charlie's place. I may not have seen that dive you did, but after your performance tonight I can tell you that there's no one better for the job,"" Wood squeezed his shoulder one more time before letting go and picking up the crate. ""Now come on, we've got to get back to the castle.""

They trudged back up to the castle, Wood happily telling Harry that the Quidditch Cup will have Gryffindor on it this year.

""I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons,"" Wood said.

Harry smiled happily as he reentered the common room and made his way back up to his dorm, though the smile dimmed a bit when he realized Draco had already gone to sleep. He had been planning on talking to him after his training session with Wood. Ron quickly distracted him though, asking questions about what he and Wood did until Percy came by and told them it was lights out. Harry lay down in his bed staring at his canopy, and as his eyes fluttered shut his gaze shifted to the foot of his bed, and for the first time he noticed the pair of antlers carved into the wood.



Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like a home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.

On Halloween morning they woke up to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry was glad to be partnered with Draco, though he felt bad for Seamus Finnigan, who was partnered with Neville, and Ron, who was working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to any of them since the day Harry's broomstick arrived.

""Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. ""Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is important, too - never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.""

It was very difficult. Harry and Draco swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. At the table on Harry's other side, Seamus got so fed up with his feather he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it - Harry had to put it out with his hat, as Neville had forgotten his again.

Ron, at the table on Draco's other side, wasn't having much more luck.

""Wingardium Leviosa!"" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.

""You're saying it wrong,"" Harry heard Hermione snap. ""It's Win-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.""

""You do it then if you're so clever,"" Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, ""Wingardium Leviosa!""

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.

""Oh, well done!"" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ""Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!""

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.

""It's no wonder no one can stand her,"" he said to Harry and Draco as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, ""she's a nightmare, honestly.""

Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face - and was startled to see that she was in tears.

""I think she heard you,"" said Harry.

""So?"" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ""She must've noticed she's got no friends.""

""Yes, and you haven't any money, but that doesn't mean you want people making fun of you for it,"" Draco snapped and strode away from Ron and Harry. This was the most he had said to them since last week.

Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry, Ron, and Draco overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.

Harry noticed a lot of the students, and even a few of the professors were watching him and whispering. While this wasn't unusual for him since coming to Hogwarts, tonight it felt different.

""Why is everyone staring at me?"" he asked Draco. Draco paused in scooping stir-fry onto his plate and glanced around at the faces staring at Harry.

""Oh,"" said Draco, setting down the stir-fry plate and turning to Harry with wide grey eyes. ""It's because it's Halloween, I suppose.""

""What's Halloween got to do with anything?"" Harry asked, reaching for a dish of curry that looked especially delicious.

""Well, that's the day you defeated You-Know-Who,"" Draco said, casually, taking a bite of his stir-fry. Someone's utensils dropped, ringing loudly even among the chatter of the Great Hall, and Harry only realized they were his when Draco reached across the table to take his arm, shaking it slightly.

""Harry. Harry?""

""What?"" asked Harry, blinking at Draco.

""Are you alright?"" Draco asked.

""Yeah, yeah I suppose. It said that on the back of my card, that I defeated Voldemort today, but I guess I must've forgot,"" Harry looked down at his plate, at the naan and rice and curry, and couldn't help but wonder what his life would've been like if his parents hadn't died ten years ago tonight. If he had never become The Boy Who Lived.

Harry didn't have much time to think about all that just then, because Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, ""Troll - in the dungeons - thought you ought to know.""

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.

""Prefects,"" he rumbled, ""lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!""

Percy was in his element.

""Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!""

""How could a troll get in?"" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.

""Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,"" said Ron.

""Well then, you're the closest thing to a troll we've got. You could give us a look into how their minds work,"" Draco said, smirking. Ron scowled at him, but Harry had to suppress his laughter.

""I bet Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke,"" huffed Ron.

They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry came to a sudden halt as he was jerked back by Draco pulling on his sleeve.

""Hermione doesn't know about the troll,"" Draco said with wide eyes. Harry felt his own eyes go wide and he grabbed Ron's arm.

""We've got to get Hermione.""

""What about Hermione?""

""She doesn't know about the troll, Ronald!"" Draco snaps.

Ron bit his lip.

""Oh, all right,"" he snapped. ""But Percy'd better not see us.""

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.

""Percy!"" hissed Ron, pulling Harry and Draco behind a large stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.

""What's he doing?"" Harry whispered. ""Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?""

""Search me,"" Ron replied. Draco said nothing but bit his lip.

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.

""He's heading for the third floor,"" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.

""Can you smell something?""

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.

And then they heard it - a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed - at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.

It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.

The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.

""The key's in the lock,"" Harry muttered. ""We could lock it in.""

""Good idea,"" said Ron nervously.

""Just do it quick,"" Draco whispered, looking about.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key and slam the door, but before he could lock it, Draco grabbed his arm.

""Wait!"" Draco hissed. ""That's the girls' bathroom!""

As if to accentuate this point the three boys froze in fear as a high, petrified scream came from inside the chamber.

""Hermione!"" they said together.

Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the wall as it went.

""Confuse it!"" Harry said desperately to his friends, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.

""Oy, pea-brain!"" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and giving Draco, who had slowly begun to creep around it, the opportunity to grab Hermione.

""Come on, Granger, you've got to run!"" Draco yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. Harry was yelling similar from where he was standing by the door.

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.

Harry did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.

Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him with a terrible blow with the club.

Hermione, despite Draco's insistent pulling on her arm, had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: ""Wingardium Leviosa!""

The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the hair, turned slowly over - and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.

Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. Draco was still clutching Hermione's arm, though his grip had gone slack.

It was Hermione who spoke first.

""Is it - dead?""

""I don't think so,"" said Harry, ""I think it's just been knocked out.""

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy grey glue.

""Urgh - troll boogers.""

He wiped it on the troll's trousers.

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the four of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.

Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron, Harry, and Draco (who had finally let go of Hermione's arm and joined his two friends). Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.

""What on earth were you thinking of?"" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Draco, then Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. ""You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?""

Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

""Please, Professor McGonagall - they were looking for me.""

""Miss Granger!""

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.

""I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know, because I've read all about them.""

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?

""If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Draco was trying to get me to safety, Harry stuck his wand up its nose, and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.""

The three boys tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.

""Well - in that case..."" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the four of them, ""Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?""

Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.

""Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.""

Hermione left.

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry, Ron, and Draco.

""Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points, for sheer dumb luck. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.""

They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.

""We should have gotten more than fifteen points,"" Ron grumbled.

""Ten, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.""

""Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,"" Ron admitted. ""Mind you, we did save her.""

""She might not have needed saving, Ronald, if you hadn't driven her to cry in the bathroom in the first place,"" Draco reminded him.

They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.

""Pig snout,"" they said and entered.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said ""Thanks,"" and hurried off to get plates.

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

A few changes this chapter, such as during the Quidditch match I use more of Lee Jordan's excellent commentating skills to describe the match. Also at the end of the chapter, I've added an extra scene with the gang in the dorms.

So sorry about how long it's been, I had a family emergency that took me away from writing for a bit, and I got sidetracked by another story I've been writing. I'll try to get more of this out this year, but no promises.

As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship.

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse - people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.

It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her and Draco's help, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Not that Harry didn't appreciate Ron and Draco telling him their experiences with Quidditch, of course.

Harry had learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and then turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since the boys had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. She had confided in Harry one night as she was helping him with his History of Magic paper that she had been worried they would kick her out if she broke any of the rules, which Harry assured her he understood. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the four of them were out in the freezing courtyard during the break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, Draco, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.

""What's that you've got there, Potter?""

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.

""Library books are not to be taken outside the school,"" said Snape. ""Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.""

""You just made that rule up!"" Draco protested. Snape leveled his scowl at Draco.

""Another five points from Gryffindor, Mr. Malfoy, for talking back to a teacher.""

""There go the points we got for fighting that troll,"" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. ""Wonder what's wrong with his leg?""

""Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,"" said Ron bitterly.



The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. The four of them sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy her work (""How will you learn?""), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Draco didn't need help with his Charms work since he and Hermione were neck and neck to be top of the class.

Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up he told his friends he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.

""Better you than me,"" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. Draco watched him go with pinched lips but didn't say anything.

Harry reentered the common room some minutes later, panting after having just sprinted back upstairs, and walked back over to his friends.

""Did you get it?"" Ron asked as Harry joined them. ""What's the matter?""

In a low whisper, Harry told them about overhearing Snape and Filch.

""You know what this means?"" he asked breathlessly. ""He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. That's where he was going when he saw him - he's after whatever it's guarding. And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion.""

Hermione's eyes were wide.

""No - he wouldn't,"" she said. ""I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.""

""Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"" snapped Ron. ""I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape.""

""What about you, Draco? What do you think?"" Harry asked.

""I don't know,"" Draco mumbled, not looking anyone in the eye. ""He's a Slytherin, so he wouldn't go after it if it wasn't in his best interest. I can't really think of anything worth going against Dumbledore, but I suppose it depends.""

""On what?"" Ron asked.

""What's that dog guarding?""

Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with that same question. Harry couldn't sleep, no matter how hard he tried. He tried to empty his mind - he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours - but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen the leg wasn't easy to forget.



The next morning dawned bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.

""You've got to eat some breakfast,"" Ron said through a mouthful of his own breakfast.

""I don't want anything.""

""Just a bit of toast,"" wheedled Hermione.

""I'm not hungry.""

Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time, he'd be walking onto the field.

""Harry, you need your strength,"" said Seamus Finnigan. ""Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.""

""Oh, honestly Finnigan, can't you see how nervous Harry is?"" Draco snapped at the Irishman, who was piling ketchup onto his sausages. ""You'll do great, Harry, you're a natural. Now, eat your bhatura before I do, they're quite good.""



By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats may be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.

Draco, Ron, and Hermione joined the other Gryffindor boys up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. Draco, not to be outdone, had performed his own charm to make the lion roar every so often.

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).

Wood cleared his throat for silence.

""Okay, men,"" he said.

""And women,"" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

""And women,"" Wood agreed. ""This is it.""

""The big one,"" said Fred Weasley.

""The one we've all been waiting for,"" said George.

""We know Oliver's speech by heart,"" Fred told Harry, ""we were on the team last year.""

""Shut up you two,"" said Wood. ""This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win, I know it.""

He glared at them all as if to say, ""Or else.""

""Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you.""

Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.

Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.

""Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,"" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.

""Mount your brooms, please.""

Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.

""And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too -""

""JORDAN!""

""Sorry, Professor.""

The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.

""And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good friend of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes - Flint flying like an eagle up there - he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and - OUCH - that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger - the Quaffle is taken by the Slytherins - that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goalposts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger - sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which - nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes - she's really flying - dodges a speeding Bludger - the goalposts are ahead - come on, now, Angelina - Keeper Bletchly dives - misses - GRYFFINDORS SCORE!""

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.

Way up above the stands Harry saw as Hagrid joined his friends, noticeable due to the roaring banner and Draco and Ron's hair. Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan, for him to keep out of the way until he saw the Snitch.

When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. He thought he caught sight of the Snitch, though it turned out to be one of the Weasley's watches, and he had to dodge a stray Bludger, though mostly he was just flying around looking for the Snitch.

""Slytherin in possession,"" Lee Jordan was saying, ""Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the - wait a moment - was that the Snitch?""

A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.

""Harry Potter, youngest Seeker in a century and Gryffindor's newest player, dives for the Snitch, Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs close on his heels. Both Seekers are neck and neck - Potter puts on a burst of speed and - OUCH! Potter slams into Flint, who seemed to have blocked the young Seeker on purpose the cheating-""

""JORDAN!""

""Sorry, Professor. Madam Hooch has called Flint over and seems to be reprimanding him for blocking Seeker Potter. The Snitch seems to have disappeared again,"" Jordan commented as the Gryffindor stands continued to yell foul.

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, ""Send him off, ref! Red card!""

""What are you talking about, Dean?"" said Ron.

""Red card!"" said Dean furiously. ""In football, you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!""

""This isn't football, Dean,"" Draco reminded him.

Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.

""They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.""

Lee Jordan was finding it hard not to take sides.

""So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating -""

""Jordan!"" growled Professor McGonagall.

""I mean, after that open and revolting foul -""

""Jordan, I'm warning you -""

""All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue to play, Gryffindor still in possession.""

Draco watched the game resume with a pinched mouth and his binoculars held firmly against his eyes, occasionally checking on Harry. His concern for his friend allowed him to catch the moment Harry dodged a dangerously close Bludger and the sudden, frightening lurch Harry's broom gave soon after.

""Did you see that?"" asked Draco. He lowered his binoculars and looked at Ron and Hermione.

""See what, mate? Not all of us have fancy binoculars,"" said Ron, his eyes still locked on the jumble of red and green robes overhead. Hermione simply shrugged.

Draco raised his binoculars again searched the sky for Harry, who was only distinguishable from the rest of the Gryffindor players through his size. When Draco's binoculars landed on him he was clinging to his broom tightly with both his hands and knees as the broom lurched as though it was trying to buck him off. But the Nimbus Two Thousand did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Draco watched the broom and Harry and realized with a sickening lurch in his stomach that Harry had no control of the broom. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated the young Seeker.

Lee was still commenting.

""Slytherin in possession - Flint with the Quaffle - passes Spinnet - passes Bell - hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose - only joking, Professor - Slytherins score - oh no...""

The Slytherins were cheering which, along with the Gryffindors groans, masked Draco's shout of worry. No one else seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.

""Hagrid, look at Harry!"" Draco said.

Hagrid raised his own binoculars and frowned at what he saw.

""Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,"" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. ""If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...""

Suddenly people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. Draco quickly raised his binoculars again. Harry's broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.

""Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?"" Seamus whispered.

""It didn't start lurching like that until he dodged a Bludger,"" said Draco. ""Do you think that could have done something?""

""Can't've been either,"" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. ""Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic - no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.""

At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.

""What are you doing?"" moaned Ron, gray-faced.

""I knew it,"" Hermione gasped, ""Snape - look.""

Ron grabbed the binoculars from Hermione as Draco swung his own to the teachers stands. Snape had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. Draco felt his stomach drop.

""Oh no,"" Draco moaned.

""He's doing something - jinxing the broom,"" said Hermione.

""What should we do?"" Ron asked.

""Leave it to me.""

Before Ron or Draco could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.

""Ron, keep your binoculars on Harry, I'll watch Snape,"" Draco instructed, already raising his back to his eyes.

Ron trained the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.

""Come on, Hermione,"" Ron muttered desperately.

""Ron, I can see her,"" whispered Draco, having caught a glimpse of her bushy mane. ""She's in the teachers stand, she just knocked over Professor Quirrell and now she's lighting Snape's robes on fire.""

""What?"" Ron exclaimed as he swung his binoculars over to Snape as Draco swung his over to Harry. Sure enough, his robes were slowly being engulfed by bright blue flames as the rest of the teachers hurried to try and put them out.

It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. Draco gave out a whoop of joy as his friend climbed back onto his broom.

""Nevile, you can look!"" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.

Harry was speeding toward the ground when Draco and the rest of the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick - he hit the field on all fours - coughed - and something gold fell into his hand.

""I've got the Snitch!"" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.

""He caught the Snitch!"" Draco shouted, dropping his binoculars around his neck and throwing his arms around Ron and Hermione as she retook her seat.

The trio raced down the stands, shoving their way past excited Gryffindors, as they fought toward the pitch. As soon as they saw him, the friends launched themselves at Harry and began congratulating him and fussing over him in the same breath.

""He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,"" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference - Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Draco, Ron, and Hermione.

""It was Snape,"" Ron was explaining, ""we saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.""

""Rubbish,"" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. ""Why would Snape do somethin' like that?""

Draco bit his lip as he and the others looked at one another, each of them wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.

""I found out something about him,"" he told Hagrid. ""He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.""

Hagrid dropped his teapot.

""How do you know about Fluffy?"" he said.

""You named it Fluffy?"" Draco exclaimed.

""Yeah, bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the -""

""Yes?"" said Harry eagerly.

""Now, don't ask me anymore,"" said Hagrid gruffly. ""That's top secret stuff, that is.""

""But Snape's trying to steal it,"" Harry insisted.

""Rubbish,"" said Hagrid again. ""Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.""

""So why did he just try to kill Harry?"" cried Hermione.

The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.

""I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!""

""When he stopped looking, Harry's broom stopped trying to buck him off,"" Draco added, still biting his lip and occasionally glancing at Harry.

""I'm tellin' yeh, yet wrong!"" said Hagrid hotly. ""I don't know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all four of yeh - yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel -""

""Aha!"" said Harry, ""so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?""

Hagrid looked furious with himself.

""I shouldn' have told yeh that,"" he muttered. ""Get on back to the castle now, it's late. An' stop thinkin' about what Fluffy's guardin'!""

The four reluctantly left and began the trudge up to the castle. Hermione and Ron immediately got into an argument about something as Draco and Harry hung back.

""Are you alright, Harry?"" Draco asked, glancing at the darker-skinned boy. Harry shrugged and pushed his glasses up.

""Bit shaken, I guess. Mostly I'm happy I didn't lose my glasses, I don't think the Dursley's would've gotten me a new pair if I had. What do you think Fluffy's guarding, and why does Snape want it so bad?""

""I don't know,"" Draco answered.

""Do you know why he hates me so much?"" Harry asked suddenly, shoving his hands into his pockets. Draco glanced over at him and sighed.

""Well, I think I remember overhearing something about him and your dad not getting along. They were in the same year, along with your mum.""

""But why does he hate me?""

Draco bit his lip again and glanced over at Harry. They had reached the moving staircases by then. Hermione and Ron were still arguing, though the subject may have changed. Draco glanced at the two before turning back to Harry.

""Can we talk about it in the dorm?""

Harry nodded and followed his friends off the moving staircase. Hermione led them through the portrait and into the common room.

""Hey, Hermione, do you want to join us in our dorm?"" Harry asked before Hermione could climb the stairs to the girl's dorm.

Once in the dorm the three boys took seats on their beds, Hermione taking the empty bed next to the bathroom.

Harry looked over at Draco, expecting him to say something. As Harry watched, Draco screwed up his face and straightened his back. The blond took a deep breath.

""Professor Snape is a Death Eater,"" he said - as if it were a simple fact of life.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron stared at Draco as if he had just said that his father was Voldemort.

""Draco, you can't just go around accusing people of being,"" Hermione looked around and lowered her voice, ""Death Eaters.""

""I'm not accusing anyone, Hermione,"" Draco hissed, ""I saw his Dark Mark.""

""When?"" Ron asked.

""How?"" Hermione added.

""Sev- er, Snape is my godfather. He was at the Manor over the summer, tutoring me in Potions so I would be prepared for Hogwarts, and he had rolled up his sleeve. I caught a glimpse of his mark - it's a bright red snake and skull. My- my father has one too,"" Draco looked at his hands.

""So, what does that mean?"" Harry asked.

""It means Snape has motive,"" Hermione answered. ""It explains why he hates you so much! You're the Boy Who Lived, Harry, you defeated You-Know-Who, any Death Eater would hold a grudge.""

""Then why hasn't he just killed me? He's had plenty of chances for it,"" Harry asked.

""Because of Dumbledore,"" Draco answered.

""That's right, Snape would never dare do anything with Dumbledore around,"" Hermione agreed.

""Even You-Know-Who was scared of him, Snape's got no chance,"" Ron added.

Harry wasn't sure if he felt better, but he thanked them none the less.

Later, as he was laying in bed trying to sleep, Harry couldn't help but think about all the mysteries of his life. Why did Voldemort try to kill him? Why did Dumbledore send him to live with the Dursleys? Why did everyone get weird around him when they talked about Sirius Black? Harry didn't know the answers to any of those questions, but he was determined to answer the one that was circling his head the most. What was Fluffy guarding?

I hope you guys like this chapter. It was interesting to write since religion in Harry Potter isn't very clear. They seem to predominately celebrate Christmas, but I'm assuming other wizards follow different religions. Like, there must be Jewish wizards or Hindu wizards or even Pagan wizards, since there are apparently Christian wizards. I'm not even going to go into how magic plays into their religion - if it does - but know that I've thought about it and it has caused me a lot of stress.

So, since Harry and James are Indian and there was some mention of James making colored lights for Harry around Halloween 1981 - which is close to Diwali (the Hindu festival of lights) - I've decided to use the Hindu Potters headcanon. In that same regard, the Blacks (including Narcissa and Draco) follow the Buddhist faith. I did some research and these appear to be the most common religions for these ethnicities in the United Kingdom.

Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid, causing some panic over the well-being of the giant squid that lived there, as well as the mermaids and other such lake-dwelling creatures. The Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.

Draco had already celebrated one holiday earlier in December. He said it was called Bodhi Day, a Buddhist holiday that he and his mother would celebrate together before celebrating Christmas with his father. Harry admired the colored lights Draco had spelled onto a small tree the house elves had brought into the dorm, they reminded him of the lights the Patil twins had conjured for Diwali in November. Harry was fascinated by the different holidays, especially the ones Parvati had taken to teaching him about since the Dursleys only ever celebrated the Christian ones. Harry didn't know what religion his father followed - if he followed any at all - but Padma and Parvati assured him that most Indian purebloods were Hindu. Harry still wished he could ask his father. He wished he could ask his father a lot of things.

No one could wait for the holidays to start so they could get back to their families and out of the Scottish chill. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all was Professor Snape's class down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.

""I feel so sorry,"" said Pansy Parkinson, one Potions class, ""for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.""

She was looking over at Draco and Harry as she spoke. Zabini laughed outright at them, and Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out the powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Though he did spare a moment to rest a hand on Draco's arm before the other boy did something rash. Parkinson and Zabini had been more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, Zabini had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Pansy had tried suggesting a niffler take his place since he was obviously focusing on the gold because he was poor. No one paid them much attention because they were more impressed with the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So instead they went back to taunting Harry about having no proper family, with the occasional jab at Draco for being disowned.

It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas, just as Draco wouldn't be returning to Malfoy Manor. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and the two of them had signed up at once. Draco was understandably still upset at his new circumstances, but Harry didn't feel sorry for himself at all. This would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.

""Hi, Hagrid, want any help?"" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.

""Nah, I'm alright, thanks, Ron.""

""Would you mind moving out of the way?"" came Parkinson's nasal drawl from behind them.

""Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose - that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to,"" Zabini added, leaning against Parkinson's shoulder.

""Do say hello to your mother for me, Blaise,"" Draco drawled, rolling his eyes as Harry and Hermione held Ron back, ""and give my regards to her newest husband. What is this one again? The fifth? Sixth?""

It was Parkinson's turn to hold Zabini back. At some point, Snape came up the stairs behind them. He merely regarded the scene, cooly, before continuing along the corridor. Zabini and Parkinson sneered at the foursome before continuing down the corridor, pushing roughly past the tree followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle.

Hagrid invited them to walk with him to the Great Hall, where he was taking his tree to join the others being decorated for the holidays.

Ron was still seething when they reached the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with Christmas decorations.

""Ah, Hagrid, the last tree - put it in the far corner, would you?""

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. Harry idly wondered how the candles didn't catch the tree on fire before he decided they must be magical candles.

""How many days you got left until yer holidays?"" Hagrid asked.

""Just one,"" said Hermione. ""And that reminds me - we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.""

""Oh yeah, you're right,"" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.

""The library?"" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. ""Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh? Yer mum was like that, Harry, if I remember right, always lookin' up somethin'.""

""Oh, we're not working,"" Harry told him brightly, only slightly distracted by the new information about his mother.

""We're been researching Nicolas Flamel,"" Draco added.

""You what?"" Hagrid looked shocked. ""Listen here - I've told yeh - drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.""

""We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,"" said Hermione.

""Unless you'd like to tell us yourself? It would save us a lot of trouble,"" Draco said.

""We've already gone through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere - just give us a hint - I know I've read his name somewhere,"" Harry added.

""I'm sayin' nothin',"" said Hagrid flatly.

""Just have to find out ourselves, then,"" said Ron, and they left Hagrid mumbling to himself as they hurried off to the library. Harry could've sworn he heard Hagrid mention his father as they left.

They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time though Harry was; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off shelves at random. Draco wandered over to the biographies section where he was slowly making his way through the various books on Dumbledore, certain he'd find some mention of the other man. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look at any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.

""What are you looking for, boy?""

""Nothing,"" said Harry

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.

""You'd better get out, then. You Potters, always mucking about with your friends, making a mess of my library. Go on - out!""

Harry left the library, mulling over his newest piece of information about his dad. Hagrid said his mum was always in the library, but Madam Pince had compared him to his dad. Perhaps they would study together? Harry smiled to himself as he entertained the idea of his parents meeting for study dates together, sneaking in food and hiding deep in the stacks to avoid Madam Pince's wrath. She made quite the terrifying figure even now as an elderly woman - no doubt she was even more imposing when his parents were at Hogwarts. That was part of the reason they had decided not to ask the librarian where they could find Flamel. The other reason was that they didn't want to risk Snape hearing what they were up to.

Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other three had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.

Five minutes later, Ron, Hermione, and Draco joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.

""You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?"" said Hermione. ""And send me an owl if you find anything.""

""And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,"" said Ron. ""It'd be safe to ask them.""

""Very safe, as they're both dentists,"" said Hermione.



The three boys found themselves distracted from their search for Flamel once the castle emptied for the holidays. With the common room mostly empty, they found themselves sitting by the fire toasting anything they could spear on a fork - bread, English muffins, marshmallows - and plotting ways of getting Parkinson and Zabini expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess as far as Harry knew, except the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family - in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.

Harry played with chessmen Draco lent him, and they were too new to be of any real use to him. He also wasn't a very good player yet, but it didn't help that they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. ""Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.""

Eventually he gave up and let Ron and Draco play each other. They were both well-versed in wizard's chess and their matches lasted much longer than Ron and Harry's. Harry spent much of the time they were playing sitting by the fire and thinking of his parents. He wondered if there was a wizard afterlife and if there was if his parents were watching him from it.

On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.

""Happy Christmas,"" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. Draco was still asleep, but Harry noted he also had a fairly decent number of gifts at the end of his bed.

""You, too,"" said Harry. ""Will you look at this? I've got some presents!""

""What did you expect, turnips?"" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.

Harry glanced between his presents and Draco's sleeping form before making up his mind.

""Draco! Draco, wake up, it's Christmas!"" Harry shouted, jumping on the blond's bed and shaking his shoulders. Draco grumbled and swatted at Harry, but he eventually sat up. He glared at Harry for a moment before noticing the packages at the foot of his bed. His face went slack with shock before a smile slowly crept on his face.

""I've got presents,"" he whispered.

""It's Christmas isn't it? What's up with you lot, you look like you've never gotten Christmas gifts before,"" Ron said, tearing into one of his gifts.

""The Dursleys used to just get me socks for Christmas if they remembered to get me anything,"" Harry commented, gravitating towards his pile of gifts.

""I didn't think I'd get anything this year,"" Draco whispered as if speaking too loud would scare his presents away. Ron stared at the two of them with some mix of horror and pity, but neither of them noticed.

Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, From Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it - it sounded a bit like an owl.

A second, very small parcel contained a note.

We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.

""That's friendly,"" said Harry.

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.

""Weird!"" he said, ""What a shape! This is money?""

""You can keep it,"" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. ""What've you got Draco?""

Harry turned and caught Draco staring at a note in his hands, his eyes suspiciously damp.

""Draco?""

Draco sniffed and wiped at his eyes, but when he turned toward Harry he had a grin on his face.

""It's from my aunt Andromeda, she was disowned when she married a Muggleborn. Here, read this,"" Draco shoved the note under Harry's nose and pointed to a paragraph about midway down the letter.




Welcome to the black sheep of the Black family, Draco. I assure you we are a wonderful bunch and we are so happy to have you. You are more than welcome to stay with my husband and me over the summer, our daughter Nymphadora is off training to be an Auror and we've been going through a bit of an empty nest crisis. You can rest assured that I will be sending my dear sister a very strongly worded letter on your behalf as well.


""Wow,"" Harry gasped, handing the letter back. ""But, the Black family? I thought your last name was Malfoy?""

""It's my mother's maiden name,"" Draco said, avoiding Harry's eyes.

""Like Sirius Black?"" Harry asked. From the way Draco refused to meet his gaze, he figured he was right. ""That's the cousin you keep talking about, isn't it? The one Nearly Headless Nick said was friends with my parents?""

""Yes. He's my first cousin once removed on my mother's side. We don't really talk about him.""

""Come on, it's Christmas, let's open some more presents!"" Ron wheedled, shoving nearly identical packages into Harry and Draco's arms. ""Here, these are from my mum. I told her you didn't expect to get any presents, so - oh no,"" Ron groaned as the two of them opened their gifts, ""she's made you Weasley sweaters.""

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. Draco opened something similar, though his sweater was in a steel blue color. It was a near uncanny match for his eyes and Harry wondered how Mrs. Weasley had known.

""Every year she makes us a sweater,"" said Ron, unwrapping his own, ""and mine's always maroon.""

""That's really nice of her,"" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.

His next present also contained candy - a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. Draco got a whole package of licorice wands and Ron got a box of Berty Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

This left only one parcel for him to open. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.

Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron and Draco gasped.

""I've heard of those,"" he said in a hushed voice, dropping his box of Every Flavor Beans. ""If that's what I think it is - they're really rare, and really valuable.""

""They're not just rare,"" Draco cut in, ""they're unheard of! My father says there's only one real cloak, and that the others are just bits of fabric with really strong Disillusionment charms on them.""

""But what is it?""

Harry picked up the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.

""It's an Invisibility Cloak,"" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. ""I'm sure it is - try it on.""

Harry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and his friends gave a yell.

""It is!""

""Look down!""

Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the Cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.

""There's a note!"" said Ron suddenly. ""A note fell out of it!""

Harry pulled off the Cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:




Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.
A Very Happy Christmas to you


There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the Cloak.

""I'd give anything for one of these,"" he said. ""Anything. What's the matter?""

""Nothing,"" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the Cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?

""Well, now I'm glad I decided to get you my gift,"" Draco said. He looked under his bed and pulled out a hastily wrapped parcel and handed it over to Harry.

Harry smiled at his friend and handed him his own messily wrapped package. He then tore into the wrapping paper and smiled at the well-loved book he unearthed.

""The Tales of Beetle the Bard?"" Harry asked.

""What the bloody hell is a Hobbit?"" Draco asked, equally perplexed.

Before either could answer the other's question, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the Cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing with anyone else yet.

""Happy Christmas!""

""Hey, look - Harry and Draco have Weasley sweaters, too!""

Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. Somehow, Harry didn't think they were wearing the correct ones.

""Theirs are better than ours, though,"" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. ""She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.

""Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?"" George demanded. ""Come one, get it on, they're lovely and warm.""

""I hate maroon,"" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. Harry and Draco followed suit, so as to not invoke the twins more mischevious sides.

""You haven't got a letter on yours,"" George observed. ""I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid - we know we're called Gred and Forge.""

Harry snorted out a quick laugh, Draco shoving his sharp elbow into his ribs, even though he was also smiling.

""What's all this noise?""

Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.

""P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Draco got one.""

""I - don't - want -"" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.

""And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,"" said George. ""Christmas is a time for family.""

They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.



Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. There seemed to be piles of food, far more than the handful of students and teachers left for the holidays, and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, exchanging cheap plastic toys and paper crowns for a myriad of magical items and elaborate headwear.

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the dinner. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.

When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack on non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.

Harry, Draco, and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy and Draco hadn't argued so much over how to help him.

After a meal of Christmas leftovers, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Even Draco, who usually stayed up most of the night, was out like a light as soon as his head hit the pillow. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.

His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.

He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the Cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.

Use it well.

Suddenly, Harry felt wide awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this Cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Is this what his dad felt when he first put on the Cloak?

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him and Draco? Something held him back - his father's Cloak - he felt that this time - the first time - he wanted to use it alone.

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.

""Who's there?"" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked down the corridor and after a brief pause headed toward the library and the Restricted Section.

As he walked he couldn't help but wonder how many times his father walked these same steps to this same destination under this same Cloak. Had his mother ever joined him under the Cloak? And who gave him the Cloak?

The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry was grateful Draco had taught him the Lumos spell earlier in the year, as Professor Quirrell still hadn't gotten around to teaching it yet and a floating lamp would look suspicious, even in a wizarding school.

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his wand to read the titles.

They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.

He had to start somewhere. Kneeling down carefully, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. After putting his wand in his mouth to free his hands he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence - the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward, tripping over the edge of the Cloak and extinguishing his wand. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside - stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf and hastily pulling the Cloak back on, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.

He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Quickly casting Lumos again didn't help any either, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchen he knew, but he must be five floors above there.

""You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library - Restricted Section.""

Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, ""The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.

Harry extinguished his wand with a quiet 'Nox' and stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him - the Cloak didn't stop him from being solid.

He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief, he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. The walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.

It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket - but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.

His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.

He had to clap his hands over his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed - for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.

But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.

There he was, reflected in it, pale and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder - but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?

Looking back toward the mirror, Harry took a closer look at the figures behind him, and very nearly screamed again. For there behind him were his parents, looking just like they did in their chocolate frog cards. His mother was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes were just like his. Bright green - exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. His father, a tall, thin, dark-haired man, put his arm around her. He wore glasses, his hair was untidy, and his dark skin had the same golden hue as his. His hair stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did. Harry tried to reach behind him to touch them, hug them, anything, but there was nothing there. If they were really there, he'd touch them, but he felt only air - his parents and the others only existed in the mirror.

""Mum?"" he whispered. ""Dad?""

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees - Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay there, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, ""I'll come back,"" and hurried from the room.



""You could have woken me up,"" said Ron, crossly.

""You should have woken me up, if you were going to the Restricted Section. I know more about the Dark Arts than either of you,"" Draco said, his arms crossed tightly over his chest.

""You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you both the mirror.""

""I'd like to see your family,"" Ron said eagerly, ""I mean you've stared at those chocolate frog cards enough.""

""And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your older brothers and everyone.""

""There are plenty of Weasleys around here at Hogwarts, why would you want to see more?"" Draco asked.

Ron glared at Draco. Even after knowing Draco for months, he still held on to some of those old pureblood grudges. Draco wasn't innocent in their spats either, but Harry had learned to ignore them.

""You can meet them over the summer at my house,"" said Ron. ""Anyways, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some sausage or something, why aren't you eating anything?""

Harry couldn't eat but didn't stop Ron from trying to serve him some sausage. It never made it to his plate. Parvati spelled it back onto the serving dish and sent a stinging hex at Ron while she was at it. Harry barely paid attention as Parvati chewed out Ron for trying to give Harry something that was tamasic.

Maybe he could ask his dad about that when he saw him again tonight. He had forgotten all about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding? what did it matter if Snape stole it, really?

""Are you feeling alright, Harry?"" Draco asked. Ron was still being lectured on Hindu diets by Parvati. ""You look a bit off.""



What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron and Draco covered in the Cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly that night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.

""I'm freezing,"" said Ron. ""Let's forget it and go back.""

""For once, I agree with Ron.""

""No!"" Harry hissed. ""I know it's here somewhere.""

When they did finally find it, Harry dropped the Cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.

There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.

""See?"" Harry whispered.

""I can't see anything.""

""Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...""

""I can only see you.""

""What about you, Draco, you can see them, can't you?""

""No, Harry...""

""Well, look in it properly, here Draco, stand where I am.""

Harry stepped aside, but with Draco in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Draco in his silk pajamas.

""Do you see them?"" Harry asked.

Draco shook his head, but his face was struck with a look of pure awe. His grey eyes were slowly filling with tears.

""I see my mother,"" he gasped. ""She's smiling at me, she looks proud. And you're there Harry."" He sobbed softly, ""She's hugging us. She said she's proud of me, and she loves me, I can see her lips moving.""

He raised his arms up as if trying to hold onto the phantom of his mother's hug. When he only touched his own shoulder he sobbed and turned away from the mirror, Ron taking his place quickly.

Draco sat on the floor and cried into his arms. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.

""Look at me!"" he said.

""Can you see your family standing around you?""

""No - I'm alone - but I'm different - I look older - and I'm Head Boy!""

""What?""

""I am - I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to - and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup - I'm Quidditch captain, too!""

Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.

""Do you think this mirror shows the future?""

""How can it? All my family are dead - let me have another look -""

""You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.""

""You're only holding the Quidditch Cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.""

""Don't push me -""

""Stop it.""

Ron and Harry stopped struggling and turned to Draco, who had finally gotten off the floor.

""There's no use fighting over it, it's all just lies anyway,"" he said.

""What do you mean?""

""The mirror only shows you what you want to see. None of it's real, it can't be. Harry's never going to know his family, my mother's never going to love me again, and Ron's probably never going to be Head Boy or Quidditch Captain! It's just showing us our fantasies!""

A sudden noise outside in the corridor stopped Ron or Harry from replying. They hadn't realized how loudly they'd been talking.

""Quick!""

Ron threw the Cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. They stood quite still, all thinking the same thing - did the Cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned at left.

""We need to go back, she's probably gone to fetch Filch. Come on.""

And Draco pulled them out of the room.



The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.

""Want to play chess, Harry?"" said Ron.

""No, you and Draco keep going.""

""Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?""

""No... you go...""

""Harry, I know what you're thinking, and you shouldn't,"" Draco said. ""Don't go back to the mirror tonight.""

""Why not?""

""I've heard stories of enchanted mirrors, and they never end well. Most wizards go mad in front of them, some have even died, and I don't want you to suffer the same fate,"" Draco pleaded.

""Besides,"" cut in Ron, ""you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?""

""You both sound like Hermione.""

""Harry, we're serious. Don't go, please.""

But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to go back in front of the mirror, and his friends weren't going to stop him.



The third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.

And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. His family all smiled out at him, only this time, walking out from behind his family, a boy with nearly silver hair. Draco stood beside his parents for a moment, smiling, before sinking down to the floor to sit beside him. Harry turned his head, but as he expected, Draco was only in the mirror. He turned back to the mirror and thought that there was nothing that could stop him from sitting here with his family all night. Nothing at all.

Except -

""So - back again, Harry?""

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting there on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.

""I - I didn't see you, sir.""

""Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,"" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.

""So,"" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, ""you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.""

""I didn't know it was called that, sir.""

""But I expect you've realized by now what it does?""

""It - well - it shows me my family -""

""And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy and your friend Draco his mother.""

""How did you know - ?""

""I don't need a cloak to become invisible,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all? Your friend Draco came close to figuring it out the other night.""

""It shows us what we want... whatever we want.""

""Yes and no,"" said Dumbledore quietly. ""It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. Draco Malfoy, who has just been outcast from his family, sees his mother's love, and the love of a best friend. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

""The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put on that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?""

Harry stood up.

""Sir - Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you a question?""

""Obviously, you've just done so,"" Dumbledore smiled. ""You may ask me one more thing, however.""

""What do you see when you look in the mirror?""

""I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.""

Harry stared.

""One can never have enough socks,"" said Dumbledore. ""Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.""

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.

Harry had just closed his eyes when his curtain was pulled back and the pale form of Draco Malfoy suddenly invaded his bed. Draco's wand was lit and his face held in a scowl.

""You went back, didn't you?""

Harry blinked at the sudden light that was invading his bed and fumbled to put his glasses back on.

""What?""

""You went back to the mirror!"" Draco whispered harshly. ""Harry, what were you thinking? I told you that mirror's no good -""

""Don't worry, Draco, I won't be going back,"" Harry interrupted him. ""Dumbledore's moving it.""

Draco paused and seemed to deflate.

""Oh. That's... good. Good. It was dangerous to leave such a powerful object laying around where anyone could find it.""

""Can I go to sleep now?"" Harry asked.

""What? Oh, yes, of course. Goodnight Harry.""

""Goodnight Draco.""

Draco crawled out of Harry's bed and back into his own, extinguishing his wand as he did. Harry took his glasses off and set them back on his nightstand.

""Harry?""

""Yes, Draco?""

""It was nice, wasn't it? Seeing your family?""

Harry smiled.

""Yeah, it was.""

The dorm was silent for a moment, aside from Ron's snoring.

""I miss my mother,"" Draco whispered quietly.

""Me too, Draco.""

They fell to silence again, then slowly fell asleep. Harry's hand under his pillow rested against the chocolate frog cards of his family. He slept with a smile and dreamed of soft voices singing him to sleep.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the holidays, the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. When he wasn't up all night staring at the chocolate frog cards, he was having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.

""You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,"" said Ron, when Harry told him and Draco about these dreams.

""Harry, are you sure these are just dreams?"" Draco asked him later that night when they were alone. It had become somewhat of a habit for them, staying up late at night and crawling into each other's beds to talk.

""Why?""

""I've overheard my father talking about the War with my mother a few times. He says the thing he remembers most about serving the Dark Lord, er, Voldemort, was the bright green light of the killing curse,"" explained Draco, haltingly. Harry wasn't sure how he felt about dreaming of his parents' deaths nearly every night.

Hermione, who came back a day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (""If Filch had caught you!""), and disappointed that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.

They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other three, because Quidditch practice had started again.

Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired after training.

Then Harry and the rest of the team found out the reason for Wood's relentless training. Snape would be refereeing their match against Hufflepuff. Wood was trying to make sure everyone played a clean game to give Snape the least amount of cause for taking away points, but Harry was more concerned for his own safety. After what happened the last match and what Draco had told him, Harry didn't want Snape anywhere near him when he was playing Quidditch.

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess while Draco watched. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something the boys thought was very good for her. Draco and Ron took turns playing against her when they weren't playing against each other.

Ron didn't look up from where he was concentrating on the chess board, but Draco looked over when Harry sat down next to him.

""What happened?"" Draco asked, ""You look terrible.""

Speaking quietly so no one would hear, Harry told them about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.

""Don't play,"" said Hermione at once.

""Say you're ill,"" said Ron.

""Pretend to break your leg,"" Hermione suggested.

""Really break your leg,"" said Ron.

""Are you two mad?"" Draco asked, staring at the other two in puzzlement. ""Harry can't back out, there isn't a reserve Seeker. Gryffindor wouldn't be able to play at all, which means Slytherin would win the House Championship again!""

At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb into the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.

Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.

""What happened?"" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry, Ron, and Draco.

""Nott,"" said Neville shakily. ""I met him, Parkinson, and Zabini outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.""

""Go to Professor McGonagall!"" Hermione urged Neville. ""Report him!""

Neville shook his head.

""I don't want more trouble,"" he mumbled.

""You've got to stand up to them, Neville!"" said Ron. ""They're used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in from of them and make it easier.""

""There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Parkinson's already done that,"" Neville choked out.

Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.

""You're worth twelve of them,"" Harry said. ""The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where are they? In Slytherin with all the other snakes.""

If Harry had looked, he would have caught Draco's flinch, but he was more focused on the weak smile Neville gave him as he unwrapped the frog.

""Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?""

As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.

""Dumbledore again,"" he said, ""He was the first one I ever -""

He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron, Draco, and Hermione.

""I've found him!"" he whispered. ""I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here - listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!""

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.

""Stay there!"" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. The boys barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.

""I never thought to look in here!"" she whispered excitedly. ""I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.""

""Light?"" said Ron.

""So that's where that book went!"" Draco exclaimed. ""I've been trying to get my hands on it myself.""

Hermione shushed them and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.

At last she found was she was looking for.

""I knew it! I knew it!""

""Are we allowed to speak yet?"" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.

""Nicolas Flamel,"" she whispered dramatically, ""is the is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""

""Of course!"" Draco gasped.

Harry and Ron didn't have quite the same reaction.

""The what?"" they asked.

Draco rolled his eyes at them.

""Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look - read that, there.""

She pushed the books toward them, and Harry and Ron read:




The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.



There have been many reports of the Philosopher's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).


""See?"" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. ""The dog must be guarding Flamel's Philosopher's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!""

""A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"" said Harry. ""No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.""

""And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,"" said Ron. ""He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?""

""It still feels like we're missing something, though,"" Draco murmured. ""Like there's something more Snape's planning.""



Harry only remembered about Snape and the coming match the next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts class. He told Ron, Draco, and Hermione that he was going to play, but as the match drew nearer, he grew more and more nervous, no matter what he told his friends. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. Harry wasn't sure they'd be allowed to overtake Slytherin in the House Championship, no matter how wonderful that idea was, not with such a biased referee.

Harry wasn't sure if he was imagining it or not, but he kept running into Snape wherever he went. It was like he was following him, trying to catch him alone. It was worse in Potions, and if it weren't for the calm reassurances from Draco, Harry would have thought that Snape knew they'd found out about the Philosopher's Stone. He didn't mention it to the other boy, but he had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.



Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that his friends were wondering if they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly head a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Ron, Hermione, and Draco, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had all brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that the three of them had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Nott using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.

""Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,"" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.

""I know,"" Ron snapped. ""Don't nag.""

""Hush both of you, I'm trying to concentrate,"" Draco hissed, eyes glued to the pitch.

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.

""Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch, it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much. Diggory's a good Seeker, but no match for you as far as flying.""

""The whole school's out there!"" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. ""Even - blimey - Dumbledore's come to watch!""

Harry's heart did a little somersault.

""Dumbledore?"" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard, or the seafoam green robes.

Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.

""I've never seen Snape look so mean,"" he told Hermione and Draco.

""You've never seen him yell at a house elf,"" Draco muttered. Hermione looked confused and opened her mouth to say something, but Ron interrupted her by exclaiming in pain.

Someone had knocked Ron in the back of the head. It was Zabini, flanked by a smirking Parkinson and Nott, who were further flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

""Oh, sorry, Weasley, we didn't see you there.""

Zabini grinned broadly at Nott and Parkinson.

""Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?"" Parkinson mused. ""Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley? Not that you have any money for it.""

Ron didn't answer, if only because of Draco's restraining hand; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.

""I think they just choose people for the Gryffindor team that they feel sorry for,"" said Nott loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. ""Potter's got no parents and the Weasley's have got no money - you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.""

Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Nott.

""I'm worth twelve of you, Nott,"" he stammered.

The Slytherins howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the fame, said, ""You tell him, Neville.""

""Longbottom, if brains were gold, you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something,"" said Zabini.

""We can't all have nifflers for mothers, Blaise,"" Draco sneered, ""we'd run out of fortunes to steal.""

""What's that supposed to mean?"" Zabini demanded, standing from his seat and glowering at the Gryffindors.

Draco carefully and slowly turned in his seat, casually looking up at the flustered boy, and smirked. ""Just hoping nothing happens to your mother's newest husband, there aren't too many wealthy bachelors left in Wizarding England. Though I hear eighth time's the charm.""

""Draco!"" said Hermione suddenly, ""Harry -!""

Draco snapped his head around just in time to watch Harry go into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.

""You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!"" said Parkinson.

""Oh, maybe it'll be enough for Blaise's mum to consider marrying him next,"" Draco retorted.

It was enough to settle Ron, but Zabini took offense. Before Draco knew what was happening, Zabini was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Ron didn't hesitate before slamming into Nott, though Neville took a moment before clambering over the back of his seat to help. Pansy was wise enough to take a step back to avoid the scuffle.

""Come on, Harry!"" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape - she didn't even notice Draco, Zabini, Ron, and Nott rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches - the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.

The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.

""Ron! Draco! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!"" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.

Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it - the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped - then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.

""Well done,"" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. ""Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...""

Snape spat bitterly on the ground.



Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now - no one could ever say he was just a famous name anymore. The evening air had never smelt so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; his friends in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed and Draco grinning at him despite the bruise rapidly forming on his cheek.

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape...

And speaking of Snape...

Harry watched as the hooded figure swiftly made its way down the steps and across the grounds toward the forbidden forest. Harry, recognizing the figure's prowling walk as Snape's and wondering what he was up to, quickly mounted his broom and followed him silently into the forest. He couldn't see where Snape had gone at first, but as he carefully flew lower and lower over the forest he caught the sound of voices and flew closer, landing noiselessly in a towering beech tree.

Harry had to strain his ears, but as he listened to Snape and Quirrell talk below him, he liked what they were saying less and less.

Quirrell was still standing in the clearing, quite still as though he was petrified, when Harry left.



""Harry where have you been?"" Hermione squeaked.

""Congratulations, Harry!"" Draco beamed, wincing as he aggravated his bruise, but looking no less chipper.

""We won! We won! We won!"" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. ""And I gave Nott a black eye, and Draco cracked one of Zabini's teeth, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.""

""Never mind that now,"" said Harry breathlessly. ""Let's find an empty room, you wait until you hear this...""

He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind him, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.

""So we were right, it is the Philosopher's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus-pocus' - I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantment, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -""

""So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?"" said Hermione in alarm.

""It'll be gone by next Tuesday,"" said Ron. Draco nodded solemnly in agreement.

Hope y'all liked the changes I've made! I also decided to introduce Theodore Nott into the story as part of the Slytherin trio (not counting Crabbe and Goyle). I also made the executive decision to call it the Philosopher's Stone instead of the Sorcerer's Stone despite me being American because it just sounds better. I honestly don't get why they had to change the name in America, that's just so stupid.

Anywho, hope y'all enjoyed! Sorry for being absent, but I figure y'all are used to it by now -_-"

This, in and of itself, would be odd enough, since the lilac kitten was about all that ensured Harry was out of bed before noon. Nonetheless, before the sun had even made an attempt to properly break over the horizon, there was a knock at Harry's door.

Harry would confess to being a light sleeper these days, and admittedly he doesn't get many visitors that aren't the same people he's been seeing for the past 15 years. And there's only a handful of people (if you consider the entire surviving Weasley family only part of a handful) that know the actual location of his flat in muggle London. It was probably just Hermione wanting to have breakfast with him before she headed to work, or Ron wanting to take him down to Holyhead to watch Ginny practice. There wasn't any danger lurking on the other side of his front door. Just a friend looking to get him out of the house.

There wasn't any reason to be afraid.

Despite those entirely rational thoughts that rolled through Harry's head, he couldn't seem to loosen his grip on the edge of his bedsheets as he frantically tried to grab for his wand and his glasses, stashed in two separate locations, with the same hand. He ended up knocking his actual alarm clock onto the hardwood floor, and the noise startled him enough that he froze and tried to hear past the silence of his bedroom and over the blood that rushed through his ears.

The knock continued, haltingly and at an awkward tempo. It paused, then resumed again almost timidly, as if apologetic for its former frantic tone.

Harry swallowed past the toad-sized lump in his throat, and attempted the 'Take a deep breath, Harry, steady your hands, Harry, you'll be alright, Harry, you're not alone, Harry' that Hermione had impressed upon him. Except he was alone, besides whoever had just woken him up at the ass-end of dawn.

Harry's inner diatribe was cut short as the knocking continued and gold eyes squinted at him accusingly from the catbed pressed up against the wall underneath his bedroom window. Ron said it was weird that Harry and his cat liked to stare at each other from their respective beds. Hermione said it was sweet that they'd become such great companions, and formed such a comfortable bond so quickly. Harry just liked knowing that there was another living being with him in the dark.

The kitten chirped questioningly. 'Well? Are you going to answer  that or not?', the look seemed to say. It should be noted that Harry could not actually speak cat. It should also be noted that Harry wasn't aware, before he owned a kitten of his own, that cats were capable of having different looks. He is now very aware of this feline ability, especially since it was being presented at that very moment.

""Yes, yes, I'm going,"" Harry responded, voice still rough from sleep. Mostly to the cat, but also to somewhat to himself because even Harry thought it was just a tad bit barmy to hold full conversations with a small ball of sentient fluff. He grabbed his wand from under his pillow, this time with no alarm clock casualties, and finally put on his glasses. In his peripheral, Harry saw the kitten's glare become even more disdainful, and she stood with a huff (could cats even huff?). She had apparently deemed that he was taking too long, even though the knocking had only begun maybe one, possibly two minutes ago.

She walked to the doorway of his room, and looked back at him as if to say 'I'm up now, and I say we're going to answer this door. Stop your dallying, and let's get a move on.' She trotted through the living room, head as high and haughty as a cat's could be (which is, of course, very). Harry followed obediently.

She plopped, or perhaps an attempt at something more elegantly than a plop, down in front of the door. Her fuzzy tail swished slowly, and she looked up at him expectantly. 'I'm just here for moral support'

Wand gripped tight in hand, Harry called out ""Who is it?"" through the door, and received an approving 'Mraow' from somewhere near his right foot when his voice only shook marginally.

""It's Neville, Harry. May I come in?""

Harry slid the chain out, turned the deadbolt, unlocked the knob, and opened the door.

""Neville, is something wrong?"" Harry said, stepping to the side so Neville could come in. Harry frowned, taking in Neville's harried appearance in the dim lighting - his hair was standing in approximately 4 different directions, and his clothes were horribly rumpled. Neville wasn't known for looking necessarily well put together, but he also wasn't known for showing up on Harry's doorstep before dawn.

""Yes, I mean, no, I mean -"" Neville sidestepped Harry, and Harry figured the the only reason Neville wasn't wringing his hands, or ripping out large quantities of his hair, was that his hands were occupied by an inconspicuous wooden box, about the size of a large textbook.

When he was finally inside, and Harry's front door was closed and re-locked, Neville thrusted the box forward, and Harry was able to read the top which read ""DEAR HARRY & NEVILLE"" in large block letters. Harry took a step back, unconsciously placing more space between himself and whatever it was about the box that had Neville so... extra Neville-looking.

 ""I found this,"" Neville said, in an approximation of level voice.

 ""You...found it? Where did you find it, Neville?"" Out of the corner of his eye, Harry just barely saw a tiny gray tail leave the room, obviously uninterested with the grungy looking newcomer.

 ""I was going through some of my parents old things, and I found this,"" he thrusted the box forward again, his eyes went a bit frantic. This time Harry reached out to grab Neville's hands, which he found trembled slightly from holding the box so tightly. ""I found this, Harry, and it has our names on it, and I wanted to open it with you, and Merlin, I don't even know what time it is but I found this box - ""

 Harry felt several steps behind wherever Neville's thoughts were, and led his friend over to the brown leather couch Ginny had picked out for his flat, while Neville continued a stream of consciousness speech about The Box. Harry was frankly surprised he hadn't run out air yet. He guided (pushed) Neville into sitting, and interrupted him before he could actually talk until he was blue in the face.

 ""Neville,"" Harry said firmly, placing his hands on Neville's shoulders. He forced the taller man to look up from The Box, and into Harry's eyes. ""You found a box.""

 Neville nodded slowly, and his eyes widened again. Harry felt Neville's shoulders tense as he, improbably, gripped the box even tighter.

 ""Our names are on it, Harry. And it was with my parents' things. Harry, I'm..."" Neville's sentence trailed off, and his head hung limply between his shoulders as he stared at the box. Harry let go of his shoulders, and thought about what Neville was trying to say.

 He'd found a box. With his parents' things. And it had their names on it. Harry's mind roiled over the three sentences Neville had practically been chanting since he'd walked in the door.

 ""Neville, do you think that box belonged to our parents? That it's for us?"" Harry placed a hand over one of Neville's which were once again shaking.

 The room was still too dark for Harry to properly see Neville's face. His entire body seemed to be shrouded in shadows from every direction. Harry reached over the arm of the couch and flicked on the lap, and for a second wished he hadn't - it was like trading one set of shadows for another.

 Neville's skin was sallow and pale, and his bloodshot eyes were watery with unshed tears. The hunch in his shoulders and his deep slouch gave off the immediate impression that Neville was a man on his last legs.

 ""Neville, are you alright?"" Harry watched Neville's face fall even more, if that was at all possible. His bottom lip trembled, and the soft glow of the lamp played on the shadows of his face. Harry himself certainly did not feel okay.

 ""I couldn't sleep,"" he said quietly. Neville brushed his fingertips lightly over the cover of the box, and as he traced the letters of their names almost reverently, it started to truly sink in for Harry what Neville had just brought through his front door.

 ""I couldn't sleep, so I was going through my parents' old things. Gran never went through it all; I just figured it was too tough for her all these years, rummaging through all their stuff like they're not here anymore."" Neville paused, as if he was waiting for Harry to interrupt him again; Harry didn't. When he started up again, his voice was soft and sad. ""Most of it was just old documents, papers. Gran already had most of the important stuff. But then I found this box, Harry, and I just had to come right over.""

 Harry had the strangest thought that perhaps Trevor had taken up residence in his vocal cords, because he was once again swallowing past a lump in his throat. Harry imagined this was exactly what Neville had been looking for - some hidden gem under a pile of old papers that would completely change everything. But what was one supposed to do when they actually found it?

 ""Well I suppose we should open it, don't you think?"" Harry didn't actually know at all what to do in this situation, but sometimes his life required that he pretend.

 ""But what if...,"" Neville's sentence trailed off, and when he looked up, Harry thought that he hadn't seen him look so lost since they were taking classes at Hogwarts together. ""What if just makes everything worse? How could it possibly make anything better, Harry? My parents are never going to leave St. Mungo's, and your parents are never coming back. How could whatever's in this box make that feel any easier?""

 Harry cleared his throat, damned Trevor and his apparating, and tried once again to look like had had any idea what he was doing. The war had taken too much from all of them, but it had also helped Neville grow into the person he needed to be. In the very end, when they had almost nothing left to fight with, Neville had hope. It had filled him when Voldemort had expected them all to be empty, and in turn it inspired those around him to keep fighting.

 And now Neville had come to him with this box with their names on it, except he was truly empty this time. There wasn't any of the hope left. Just the afterimages of everything that had been lost to the war, and the hollow space where their parents should have been. He looked as if the entire weight of the world was balanced precariously on his shoulders, and Harry so desperately wanted to lighten his burden.

 ""I don't sleep much anymore either,"" Harry said. There was no preamble, and Neville looked startled at the confession. ""I go on a lot of walks. It's how I found my cat."" Harry pointed off to Neville's side, where the kitten was sitting across from them, staring curiously. ""Her name's Winston.""

 ""Hi, Winston."" Neville waved slowly at the kitten, who gave a small 'mraow' in response.

 ""Most nights I used to just lay in bed and stare at the wall. But ever since I found her, she stays up with me, and I feel a little better. Sometimes."" Neville had remained silent while Harry was speaking, but had moved closer to him on the couch until their knees were touching. ""Other times I feel like I'll just collapse into nothing in the dark, and then I have to do like you, I guess. Get up and do something.""

 As if sensing the mood shift, Winston came over and tapped harry on the ankle chirping out a  request to be picked up. Harry obliged, and she situated herself comfortably in the small dip where Harry and Neville's knees met, curled a ball.

 ""It wasn't fair, what happened to us."" Neville ran a fingertip down Winston's back while he talked, the box balanced in his lap. He gained a rumbling purr for his attentions. ""It wasn't fair what happened to anyone during the war. If anyone understands that it's you and I, Harry. But...""

 ""Neville - "" Harry began, but he was cut off before he could offer any words of comfort.

 ""Sometimes I wish I could they could have been selfish."" Neville looked up now, as color blotted back into his face. His cheeks flamed a ruddy blush, and his lips were pursed before he went on. ""I wish they could have just run away from it all, and let someone else handle it. I wish we could have done that too. Why couldn't someone else have saved the bloody world, Harry? Why did it have be us?""

 Neville's voice was high and panicky as his eyes searched Harry's for answers. Harry thought he hadn't felt this helpless since he'd had to watch friends and those he loved die around him, without anything he could do to save them. It was definitely a familiar feeling to him, watching a horrible thing happen in front of you, and having no idea how to stop it, fix it, or make it better.

 ""You don't wish that, Neville. Not really."" Harry shook his head, partly in disbelief and partly in distress. He reached for Neville's shoulder, but stopped his hand halfway and pulled it back.

 ""But I want to mean it, Harry. Wouldn't it have been easier? I know you, Harry. I know you never wanted to be The Chosen One or The Boy Who Lived,"" Neville said, leaning forward while he spoke until their shoulders almost touched. Winston voiced her displeasure at being jostled, and batted at the box still in Neville's lap with a paw as its contents slid around inside. Neville's breath was coming fast, and his cheeks darkened even more. ""Maybe I wish I wasn't a hero too.""

 ""Neville."" Harry's voice was imploring, trying to get Neville to see a light at the end of the tunnel that Harry couldn't even see for himself most days. Neville shook his head in reply, as if he was attempting to actually shake off Harry's words.

""No, no, you don't understand, - "" he began, but he was interrupted by his own tears, and, dear Merlin, Harry was really going to die of grief for Neville bloody Longbottom in his own damned livingroom. ""I wish, I wish -""

 ""Oh, Neville,"" Harry whispered, and grabbed the man's ruddy cheeks in his hands. They were slippery with tears, and Harry thought it was a good analogy, since at that particular moment it felt like the entire world was slipping through his fingers, one survivor at a time. ""You're a hero because you're you, Neville. Not the other way around.""

 Harry's throat felt like he was choking on glass, but he kept forcing the words out. This felt like the most important Hero's Speech he'd ever made, and he'd be damned if he let Neville leave his flat still feeling this way.

 ""You're a hero because despite all the hurt and pain, you didn't run away. You chose to save the world instead. And so did they, Neville. And we are so bloody proud of them for it. They were heroes, and they'd be damned proud of us for being heroes too.""

 Harry felt rather than saw the tension bleed out of Neville, and he heard a gentle 'tap-tap' as he closed his eyes and let his tears fall on the top of the box. Neville placed his hands on top of Harry's where they still rested on his cheeks, and he huffed out a breath.

 Harry leaned his body forward until his forehead touched Neville's, and he rubbed the scruff of his hair against Neville's. ""You're a good man, Neville,"" he said, and he closed his own eyes when the combined heat of their breaths fogged up his glassed. ""You're a damned good man, and I'm damned proud of you, too""

 He felt like he could have sat there forever, trying to send every big of positivity he struggled to find on a daily basis into Neville through this small bit of contact they had. But the moment was cut short when they were startled apart by the clatter of The Box sliding off Neville's lap and crashing to the ground. Winston voiced her displeasure at being disturbed from her spot on their knees, and peered over the edge of the couch where the box laid on its' side, and its contents splayed across the hardwood floor.

 Neville released Harry's hand, and Harry went to do the same to Neville, but not before wiping off the man's cheeks with the sleeve of his jumper.

 They stared at Harry's floor, where a few photographs and a thick, plastic rectangle laid scattered. Neville bent down to pick them up, and Winston took this as her opportunity to jump down from the couch and climb into the overturned box.

 Neville situated the photos in his hands until they were all rightside up, and facing the right way; there were three in total. Harry shifted down the couch so that he was no longer facing Neville, but that they were pressed together from shoulder to thigh. They peered down at the photographs together.

 The first was a picture of Harry and Neville, predictably enough. They were facing each other, tiny toddler shoulders shaking with laughter, with Harry's chubby baby hands smushing Neville's full cheeks together until his face was almost unrecognizable. Neville's hands pressed over Harry's own, and distended his mouth further. It was an eerie, if not entirely innocent replica of the comfort they had just shared, even though the picture had to have been take over 20 years ago.

 ""What is your utter obsession with my cheeks, mate?"" Neville chuckled, looking sidelong at Harry, who had the decency to look indignant.

 ""Well it's not my fault they're the focal point of your face,"" Harry said. He grabbed the photo from Neville's hand, and couldn't stop the smile that spread over his face in response to Neville's own. It was nice to see Neville smiling.

 Harry's smile grew even wider when he looked at the next photo Neville was holding.

 It was all four of their parents, clothes mussed and hair a mess, standing in front of a banner that said ""Happy 1st Birthday Harry & Neville"". They were grinning from ear to ear, and the photo captured James and Frank looking at each other conspiratorially before grabbing their respective wives and kissing them messily on the cheek. Harry and Neville saw their mothers screech in disgust and bat their husbands away, and then the photo reset and began all over again.

 Harry didn't feel the embarrassment that most young adults did at seeing their parents display affection. He feel like he was seeing some of the strongest people he knew (or if you wanted to get grief-stricken about it, didn't know) share one of the last happy moments of their lives.

 Neville sniffed precariously, and rubbed his eyes with one hand and handed the photo to Harry with the other. The final photo lay in his lap, and Harry let out a soft, ""Oh, Neville,"" for the second time that morning.

 It was all six of them, Harry being held by his parents, and Neville by his, standing in front of the birthday banner. Harry and Neville were waving, and Alice and Lily were pressed shoulder to shoulder so they would all fit in the photograph. They were all smiling, and they looked as if no evil in the world could ever steal the happiness they'd found. For a brief moment, Harry felt cheated, because he knew the ending to the story, and it wasn't a happy one.

 And yet...

 He looked over at Neville, whose eyes were lit up as if they were filled with every star in the sky, staring in complete awe at the photograph. And he realized that this was actually exactly how his parents would have liked this story to end. He patted Neville on the shoulder lightly when he took in a watery series of breaths.

 ""They look so happy, Harry. I don't know if I've ever seen them look this happy. It's wonderful, isn't it? Look how wonderful it is!"" Neville's voice had taken on a wistful tone, and he held the photograph up so it was just inches from Harry's face. Harry couldn't help but laugh, deep and down from his belly, and nod along with Neville's enthusiasm.

 ""It's wonderful, Neville,"" he said, and covered Neville's hands with his own, so that he could press Neville's arms back to his sides and lower the photograph from his face. When he could see again, Harry saw him curl around behind himself and grab the black rectangle that had follow out with the photographs.

 ""And look! There's this! It's a...,"" Neville turned the rectangle in his hands, inspecting its sides. ""I have no idea what this is.""

 Harry's eyes caught on the logo branded on the front, and almost instantly recognized it.

 ""It's a Walkman! Blimey, these things are ancient..."" He held his hand out, and Neville handed it to him, eyes asking what the hell a Walkman was. Harry answered before he could get the question out. ""It can play music, but also record stuff and then play it back."" He flipped it over and saw that there was indeed a cassette tape inside. He figured his mom, the only Muggleborn in the bunch, was probably the one who had originally owned it and modified it for magical use.

 Harry pressed what looked to be the play button, and the tape crackled to life, sound pouring out of a speaker that had to have been magically created inside of the music player.

 There was a soft ""tap-tap-tap"" against the microphone, and then:

 


""Testing, testing, this is James Potter, recording live from the Potter living room, where I am joined by my exhausted compatriots on the evening of August 1st, after a long day of wrangling 1 year olds.""


 


""Wrangling, James? You make our children sound like hippogriffs!""


 


""Well, Lily, I can't help it if they act beastly.""


 


""Beastly?! The only thing beastly here is you, James, you absolute codger! 'Oh, my back. Lily, grab Harry, he's on the broomstick again, I need to catch my breath!' Honestly if I wasn't your wife, I'd laugh at you. Actually, I think I will anyway.""


 


""Do you hear how my wife talks to me, Frank? The injustice of it all, I tell you. Where is the respect? The dignity?!""


 


""Probably in the rubbish bin with all the diapers we've changed.""


 


""Now that you mention it, Frank, go check on them, would you? And Alice, it's your turn to pull double duty. Damn my pride, I might literally faint if I have to change another of those boys' nappies.""


 


""The absolute bloody hell it is! Besides being an absolute carbon copy of you, James, that boy takes man-sized shites.""


 


""Alice! The mouth on you since the boys were born! I thought you'd said you were going to try and stop?""


 


""Oh, bollocks to that, Lily. They're sleeping, aren't they? I try, honestly I do, but my mum raised me have a full and varied vocabulary like a good, worldly witch. And that includes a good swear every now and again. And it's not like Frank is much help. Is't that right, Frank?""


 


""I'm afraid I don't know what you mean, darling, I am the pinnacle of virtuosity and sainthood. And speaking of saints, our little angels are resting comfortably after performing their best hellion routine all afternoon.""


 


""Oh, we should take a picture before they wake up! I bet they look so precious. If there's one thing we did correctly, it's make the most wonderful little babies. Even if mine looks nothing like me.""


 


""Now, now, Lily. He might have gotten my flowing ebony locks that blow gracefully in the autumn breeze -""


 


""Bugger me, here we go...""


 


"" - My golden copper skin that shines in the afternoon sun as if was was enchanted by Merlin himself -""


 


""This is the man you chose to marry, Lily darling. My dear mother could find you a replacement, just say the word.""


 


"" - And my dashing good looks, descended from the Indian courtesans of old, as well baring part of my name, strong and firm - but at least he has your eyes, my darling.""


 


""Oh, is that where you were going with that? Took you long enough.""


 


""You cannot begrudge a poet for the time it takes him to spin the web of his words.""


 


""Except you're not a poet, and I can begrudge you until I'm blue in the face.""


 


""Aren't they adorable, Frank? I think my teeth are rotting from how adorable they are.""


 


""Adorable would indeed be an apt word to describe them. And to think, just one year ago today, adorable James Potter was bawling, seeing his son for the first time.""


 

""Oi! I wasn't bawling, it was more like a mild sob.""

 


""You were bawling, dear.""


 


""Well how couldn't I! He came out, and screamed himself pink in the face and... It felt like my heart was breaking into a million damn pieces. And when he opened his eyes, and it was like I was looking into a mirror of yours...""


 


""James Potter: Teary Father. I never thought I'd see the day, Frank. Can you believe it? If someone had told me 5 years ago that James Potter would have tears in his eyes, talking about his newborn son, I'd've laughed in their face and told them they were taking the piss.""


 


""I can hardly believe it myself, Alice.""


 


""You're telling me! I never thought I'd be the settling down type. Domesticity seemed so bland. But Merlin, when that boy smiles at me, it's like I'm being knocked off my damn feet.""


 


""It's like nothing I've ever felt before, loving that boy... I get up in the morning, and I want to dedicate my every waking moment to him. The diapers, the late night feedings, the crying - none of it compares to the look in his eyes when he first wakes up in the morning.""


 


""I really thought I had it all figured out, Lily. I thought I knew the world as far as it could go. But our little Harry... I fall apart everytime I look at him.""


 


""Oh, Frank, they're making me cry! Stop it, you two, I'm an auror! I'll arrest you for this!""


 


""Alice, I seem to remember quite clearly just the other day when you waxed poetic about how 'pride did not sufficiently describe the feelings that motherhood had awoken in you' and how 'Neville's soul shined brighter than the sun'.""


 


""Frank! Whose side are you on, here?!""


 


""There are no sides, dear, only love. Sentimentality is an unfortunate byproduct of parenthood, I'm afraid. We must live and let live, darling.""


 


""Is that your 'Dad Voice', Frank? If anyone's a codger here, it's you. You sound like Dumbledore with all that 'live and let live' talk.""


 


""To be honest, I'm kind of making it up as I go along. It's not like I know what a Dad sounds like behind closed doors.""


 


""Oh, Frank...""


 


""No, Lily, it's quite alright - my mother did better by me than that man ever could have. He wasn't around, and it still burns like a damn Stinging Hex. But I can be there for Neville. Doesn't matter how many mistakes I make, I'll be around for that little boy.""


 


""Frank - ""


 

""No, he's right, Alice. We have to be around for them. There's no other option in this. Our jobs are to make the wizarding world a safe place for them, so they can grow up and never have to bleed and fight the way we had to. That's what we have to do, Lily!""

 


""I know, James, but - ""


 


""If we can just win this war, if we can can set the foundation, something for them to build on, something to pass on - ""


 


""I want nothing more in the world, James, but - ""


 

""No buts, Lily! I can't bear the thought of any world except the one where the four of us raise our sons, and get to see them grow up and change the world! He could be the Minister of Magic, one day! He could be anything he damn well pleases, and I'm gonna see it happen. No buts.""

 


""They'll blow the whole bloody world away, is what they'll do. There's bugger all that could keep me from watching that.""


 


""...Yeah. Bugger all! Bugger all is gonna keep us from them. I'll do whatever it takes...""


 


""Bugger all, she says! Blimey, I'm a mess. Get me a tissue, Frank, I'm sopping.""


 


""Yes, dear.""


 


""I love you, you utter git.""


 


""I love you too, my redheaded beauty.""


 


""Frank, my tissues! I'm leaking all over the gaff!""


 


""Coming, dear.""


 

The tape clicked, signalling the end of the recording. Winston poked her head out of her new playbox, and cocked her tiny head at the sight of the two wizards, staring blankly at the Walkman. Deeming it wholly uninteresting, she crawled back inside.

 ""Those were our parents,"" Neville said quietly. ""Those...those were our parents.""

 Harry realized, suddenly, that Neville had never heard his parents converse with lucidity. And Harry had only only seen his parents as memories and apparitions in death. He was torn a little between sobbing uncontrollably, and framing the recorder so that he could pull it out and listen to it as many times as he wanted. For the time being, he just settled on saying:

 ""Your mum cursed like a barman."" Neville hooted in response, and Harry felt the somberness of his mood fade away.

 ""She did! She did, didn't she? She did, she did, she did!"" Neville jumped from his seat on the couch, and pumped both his fists above his head. He was a far cry from the broken man that had come through Harry's front door some time ago. His arms dropped, forearms resting crossed on the top of his head, and the peace on his face made some warm, happy place in Harry's chest bloom in fondness.

 Neville's rumpled jumper had slid up his stomach just the tiniest bit when he'd put his arms above his head, and there was a small stripe of pale skin visible where his shirt and pants no longer met. He looked like the carefree young man that they'd never had the chance to be, and Harry thought 'Yes, of course, this is what a happy ending looks like. Why couldn't I see it before?'

 ""They loved us so bloody much, Harry. And they would have given anything to have been here for us. But their sacrifices helped save the world, just like ours did, and - "" Neville tilted his head back, and uncrossed his arms until his hands were grabbing his hair, and his face was hidden in the crooks of his elbows. His voice was muffled when he continued, saying ""It's hard to see it sometimes, when I go visit them, and I always feel so damned guilty. But, Merlin, I love them so much I could just burst, Harry. I could burst!""

 He thrusted his arms above his head again, as if he was on the most exciting part of a rollercoaster, and was enjoying every second of the ride. Harry knew exactly how he felt, just looking at the joy on Neville's face. Suddenly compelled, he stood, and before he could regret it, he hugged Neville. His arms were around the taller man's waist, and his face only came up to his chest, but he squeezed, and tried to say the words 'I get it, I get it, it feels so goddamned good, and I get it' through touch alone. Neville's arms came up around his back, and returned the hug.

 'I know, isn't it wonderful?' his hug seemed to say.

 It was.

 Harry pulled back, after ""inconspicuously"" wiping under his glasses, and chuckled lightly. This was not how he expected his morning to go.

 ""Well that was something,"" he said jokingly. When Neville smiled back at him, Harry's heart felt a full in the places that had felt vacant before. ""And I'll tell you one thing, I am famished. What do you say to a proper muggle London breakfast, Neville?""

 Before Neville could respond, his stomach answered for him, gurgling loudly and signalling its desire for any breakfast, proper or not. Neville rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, and patted his belly.

 ""I'll take that as a yes.""

 From inside the overturned box, Winston mewed, and decided she was ready to be apart of the conversation. Neville leaned down to pick her up, then cradled her to his chest. Harry had the strangest thought that she'd probably never been up that high before. Could cats get vertigo?

 ""Why don't you spend some quality time with Winston and pack up our parents' things while I go put on some pants suitable for outside?""

 Neville was too busy cooing at a purring Winston to respond. Harry shook his head and retreated to his bedroom to get changed and look somewhat presentable. When he returned, the box was packed and on his coffee table, and Neville was waiting at the door. He'd commandeered a small, white cloth basket that Ginny had bought and called a 'knick-knack basket', and placed Winston inside. She seemed prepared to come along for their outing.

 ""All set?"" Neville looked up from the kitten, and met Harry's eyes.

 ""Yes, but you're forgetting the box."" Harry pointed to the coffee table where it remained, sitting closed and full of some of the most beautiful memories Harry had ever seen or heard.

 ""Oh, I thought I'd just leave it here. And maybe I could visit when I want to give it a listen? If...if that's okay?"" Neville's hands wrung around the hands of the basket, belaying his nervousness.

 ""That sounds perfect, Neville. I could use some more company of the human kind."" He walked over to join Neville at the front door, and grabbed his keys from the keyrack next to it. ""Winston here is a delight, but kitten conversations only go so far."" She mewled, affronted at the disparagement comments toward her conversation skills. Harry appeased her by scratching the underside of her chin, just the way she liked it. Winston accepted his apology.

 Neville laughed, a full body laugh that shook his shoulders, and lit up his face, and took years of weight off of his shoulders. He looked happy.

 ""Well then, let's head out!"" He stepped to the side so that Harry could unlock the door, and swooped one hand outward as if he were a knight making way for a fair maiden. Harry shook his head, snorting at Neville's antics, and let them all outside.

 As he turned to lock the door, he saw the sunrise peeking over the horizon from his bedroom window, bathing his entire flat in an orange hue. He closed the door, locked it, and turned around to Neville to comment on how the weather was actually allowing for sun today.

 To his surprise, the soft smile on Neville's face as he waggled a finger at Winston inside her basket felt just as rewarding as seeing the sun after spending what felt like months in the darkness.

 Neville caught him staring, and raised an eyebrow in question.

 ""Nothing, nothing. Let's get a move on, shall we?""

 They headed down the hallway, and down the stairs, shoulders brushing. The silence between them was comfortable, and was broken only occasionally by Winston's mewing.

 'Yes,' Harry thought, 'This is what a happy ending feels like.'"

She opens the door to find the cutest little boy, with the chubbiest cheeks and the longest eyelashes she's ever seen, holding out a tray of little white dumplings. He's got bright green eyes which she could swear were familiar, but they practically disappear when he smiles, eyes scrunching up.

""Hello!"" He says, sounding like this is the best thing that's ever happened to him. He's practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. ""App- err, my dad said I should bring some sweets over. 'Cause we're neighbors. I told him to make cookies, but these are good, I promise!""

""Hari, I told you not to-"" There's a tall, black haired man running up her driveway, who looks more or less exactly like the boy in front of her, and he smiles sheepishly when she gives him a once over. ""Sorry about my son, he gets a little excited about meeting new people."" The man holds his hand out, and Lily shakes it. ""I'm James Potter. And don't worry, the food's safe.""

""I'm Lily Evans."" She says, taking one of the dumplings off the tray and popping it in her mouth. They taste of coconut and sugar, and they're really quite good. ""Have you got a recipe for those?""

""Sure thing, neighbor."" James says, with a wink. ""Sorry, still. Must've given you a scare. We'll be off, now- little tyke's got homework he's avoiding. Thanks for the chat!""

""No problem. See you two around."" She says, and shuts the door once the boys have run across the driveway and into their yard.

Who knew? Having neighbors might actually be fun.

""Hari, evlo tharava solliruken..."" James rubs his forehead. That was a disaster. He's thankful the neighbor didn't get mad at them. (Hari, how many times have I told you...)

""Sorry, Appa."" Harry says, looking quite repentant. James has had this child long enough to know that that's utter crap, so he waits for something a little more sincere. ""Inime pannamaatten, Appa."" (I won't do it anymore, Daddy.)

""Good."" James nods sharply, reaching out to ruffle Harry's hair. Harry comes to life, knowing that he's forgiven, and launches himself at James, hugging his father's leg as tightly as he can. ""Ennadaa ithu..."" (Don't do me like that, bro.)

""Fine, fine."" Harry steps back, arms crossed and pouting, and James has to give in. He scoops his son up off the ground, hugging him as tightly as possible, and Harry squirms to get free.

""Appa, I'm gonna be in big kid school soon!"" Harry complains, wiggling as hard as he can. He's no match for James' arms, though, so he eventually gives up, laying his head on his father's shoulder. ""Are you hugging me extra for Amma?""

""Yeah."" James says, nodding, before he plants a kiss on the top of Harry's head and sets him down. Harry immediately runs for the still nearly full tray of kozhakattai, eagerly popping one into his mouth. James smiles, shaking his head. Harry's always had a sweet tooth, and he should've known better to make his son's favorite sweet and then tell him to give them to other people. The familiar ache in his heart starts up, though, at the mention of her, and it's a little hard to set aside, even with his son's smile lighting up the room. Harry doesn't talk about her much, anymore, and James wonders if he's forgetting.

""Appa?"" Harry calls out, and James realizes his son is tugging on his hand. ""Stop thinking. Your face gets all funny.""

""Okay."" James says, and ruffles Harry's hair. ""No more thinking. Promise.""

The familiar stream of five year olds hustle in, parents holding them by the straps of their backpacks and the collars of their shirts, and Lily Evans' face brightens with each new face passing through the door. All of them will grow up into tiny little people, by the time they leave this class, and most of them will be reading and writing pretty well, not to mention sharing and coloring in lines and all sorts of fancy stuff. She notices a familiar face at the door and waves as the little boy from Saturday, Harry Potter, bounds up to her.

""Hi Miss Evans!"" He says, bouncing on the balls of his feet. ""I made you a drawing!""

""That's so sweet of you, Harry."" She says, taking the piece of paper from his slightly sticky hands. There is a shark on it in blue highlighter, along with somewhere around twenty fish and a giant squid. A really, really, really large squid. ""I'll hang it up, maybe.""

""Cool!"" Harry says, just as James walks in, a folder in hand and glasses already slipping halfway down his nose. He pushes them back up as he strides up to Lily's desk, looking the very picture of confidence, and grins.

""Hello there."" He says, smiling brightly. He's quite dressed up-- must have a fancy job, then, or at least be the type of guy who liked dressing up for work. It's better than she can say for most of her male friends, who are still living out of laundry baskets. ""Take good care of my boy, yeah?"" James slaps Harry's shoulder like they're mates, and Harry grins. ""He's a smart one, but he's a little trouble.""

""He'll be no trouble at all, I bet."" She says, and James feigns sighing in relief, much to his son's annoyance. ""Go on and find your seat, Harry! I'm sure your classmates would love to meet you!""

Harry runs off to his seat, immediately chattering excitedly to the other kids at his table, and James stands there watching him, for a second. Lily knows the kind of pride that's shining in James' eyes right now, the type of pride that comes with watching something you've loved and waited and worked for come to life effortlessly, and she impulsively reaches out and pats his arm. James seems surprised, but rolls with the punch.

""You know, Mr. Potter, if you want your son to learn how to be without you, you'll have to leave first."" Lily says and James mockingly salutes her before leaving the room. The bell rings not a second after, and Lily stands up, smiling as she looks around the class. ""Hello there, kids! Who's ready for the best year of your life?""

""Me!"" Harry Potter hollers from the back of the room, loud enough to mask most of the whimpers and muttering, and Lily's smile widens just a little. 

""Appa!"" Harry yells, as soon as he spots James coming into the room, and launches himself at his father. James picks him up and hugs him tight. ""School was the best! Miss Evans is super cool, just like you said she would be!""

Lily stifles a laugh, just barely, and James looks inordinately embarrassed as he puts his son down, checking his folder for papers before rushing him out the door. He's cute, she thinks, but files the thought away. She's got thirty kids' names to learn-- there's no time to think about relationships, especially not with the father of one of them.

The next time she sees James, he's alone.

There's a knock on her door at eight in the morning, and James is standing on her doorstep, smiling just like his son does.

He's fresh from a morning run, judging by how his hair is even more messy and windswept than usual, and the sleeves of his gray hooded sweatshirt have been pushed up to reveal forearms that Lily isn't sure she can look at for long without serious health hazards. Making eye contact is an even bigger mistake-- his eyes look golden, thanks to the gray cast of the sky. He rolls his shoulders, obviously just meaning to stretch, and-- oh god, she's staring.

""So. How's it going?"" He asks, tapping his fingers against his leg. He's wearing basketball shorts. That alone should be a reason not to find him attractive. ""Harry gotten in a fight yet?""

""He's one of the sweetest kids I know."" Lily says, and she's not lying. Harry Potter has been an absolute joy to have in class for the whole week she's taught him, mainly because he has not cried once, yet. ""You're a lucky guy.""

""I am."" James nods, grinning, before his expression shifts just slightly. ""You want to come over for lunch, sometime? It's just that, uh, it doesn't look like anyone's showing up at your place often, and staying cooped up in the house too much can actually be bad for your health.""

""I'm free, as you've noticed."" Lily can't help but be a little annoyed, but it's mostly because James is, in fact, telling the truth. Her friends have all gotten busy with families and marriages these days, and she's been left swinging in the aftermath, too invested in her current friends to look for new ones. Maybe this is her opportunity to find new ones. ""When are you?""

""Harry's with some of my mates today, and I doubt he'd forgive me if I had lunch with you alone."" James says, a mischievous glint playing in his hazel eyes for a second, as if he's considering the idea. Lily wants him to, a little bit, but from what she's heard from Harry, James isn't likely to even lift a finger without his son's opinion on it first.""Tomorrow afternoon good?""

""Perfect."" She says, nodding. ""I'll be looking forward to it.""

""You've got no problems with rice, right?"" James asks, and seems relieved when she shakes her head. ""Thank God. Right. Lunch tomorrow sounds great."" His tongue darts out of his mouth just a little to wet his drying lips, and Lily would be screaming at him to do that in his own damn house, were it not for her legendary self-control.

He waves, looking a little shy for a second, before walking across to his driveway and back up to his door, closing it quietly behind him. Lily watches the door for another couple seconds, as if he'll come back out again, and then closes hers when he doesn't.

And that's when it hits her-- she's got to get through lunch with him tomorrow. Oh no.

""Hi Miss Evans!"" Harry yells, as soon as he opens the door. He's clad in blue and white striped overalls that make him look like a little train conductor, and judging by the hat he's wearing, that's exactly what he's been playing at. ""Daddy's cooking still, but he'll be here real, real, real quick!""

""That's cool."" She says, easily falling into her teacher voice. She's been around kids a lot, has always loved teaching, and she's got a nephew Harry's age. She doesn't particularly care for her nephew, all things said, but five is one of the most fun ages, in Lily's opinion. They've got so much to say, and so many things they want to talk about, that it's rather fun to get them going and watch them skip from topic to topic, bright and happy. ""What's he making?""

""My favorite!"" Harry says, running back to the door to lock it. ""Urulakizhangu!"" He notices Lily's confusion and giggles. ""Potatoes, sorry.""

""Liking veggies is really good, Harry."" Lily ruffles his hair, and Harry smiles wide. ""So, where's the table?""

Harry grabs her hand, suddenly, and drags her down the hallway. There are framed pictures on both walls, tons of them, and they're practically like a second layer of wallpaper. There are pictures of James with friends, baby pictures that could only be Harry, and-- oh. James and Harry's mum. Harry with his mother, as a baby. Lily suddenly feels like she's getting involved in something she shouldn't be, and has to crush the queasy feeling in her stomach as Harry drags her into the kitchen.

""Appa, she's here!"" Harry yells, letting go of Lily's hand to attach himself to his father's legs. ""Done yet?""

""All done."" James says. ""Move back, got to put this on the table.""

He turns around, pan full of potato chunks in hand, and smiles when he notices Lily. There's no wedding ring, that she can see, so she relaxes slightly. ""Hey."" He makes his way to the table, setting it down on a pot holder. The food smells amazing, and Lily takes her seat just as Harry sits down right opposite her. ""Sorry I wasn't free when you got in. Had a bit of a late start, today.""

""How late?"" Lily asks, as James puts a couple pieces of potato on Harry's plate before scooping rice out of the rice cooker with a wide, flat spoon. He pours something yellow on it next, from inside a pressure cooker. Some kind of lentils, she guesses, judging by the circular disks visible among the yellow, and James spoons something that looks like soup, then some melted butter on top before mixing it all together with his right hand.

Harry looks toward the cup full of spoons on the table, then Lily, looking quite guilty, and then proceeds to dig in with his hand the moment his father uses the edge of his plate to scrape any rice sticking to his hand off.

""Six?"" James asks, looking to Harry, who nods. ""Six.""

Lily stares at the assortment of vessels in front of her in confusion, and James, who had just sat back down, stands up again.

""Here."" He says with a smile, walking over to her side of the table before serving her some of the potatoes. ""I'll help.""

""Thanks."" She says, sure that she's blushing as he puts the food on her plate, and he hands her a spoon from the cup instead of mixing it like he did for Harry. ""Double thanks.""

""It's family germs with him, but I'll not be getting all up in your food."" James says, grinning. ""Your first real introduction to South Indian food, huh?""

""Guess so."" She says, and digs in.

They settle into conversation easily, and it's almost like Lily's known them for ages. James laughs at all her jokes, and Harry is the sweetest about telling her what's in everything. Lily, in turn, finds out way more about James than she ever thought possible-- he's her age (two months younger, in fact), he works as a pediatrician at the local hospital, and he's got two friends from uni who might be forming a gay motorcycle gang.

""They would be"", James says, looking entirely serious, ""but for the fact that they can't agree on a name. Now, Remus wants something sophisticated but edgy, and Sirius has got his heart set on Gayliens. They're aliens, but... you get the gist.""

""It's just the two of them in it?"" Lily asks, genuinely curious, and James groans.

""I wish."" He says, shaking his head. Harry swallows a mouthful of rice before laughing. ""They've got all of our friends in on it, but I, unfortunately, am disqualified from membership. There's a rule that says I'm banned.""

""What did you do to get banned?"" Lily asks, and Harry breaks into a fresh round of laughter, nearly falling out of his chair.

""I actually have a motorcycle license."" James says, chuckling. ""That's the bit that got them, I think. It's legal, so they're not up for it.""

""You're a pediatrician with a motorcycle license."" Lily says, disbelieving, and James nods. ""Parents must love you.""

""I don't tell them about that bit."" James says, laughing. ""If I did, I'd be a lot less popular.""

""Uncle Sirius says Appa was fun back in uni."" Harry pipes up. ""But then he had me and I was cooler than his friends. He'll tell stories, I bet!""

James immediately starts shoveling rice into his mouth to avoid any of Lily's questions.

She laughs, because it's so cute. James is practically a child himself, for all that he looks like an adult. Harry seems to be studying her, now that she's laughed, and she stops suddenly. He looks guilty, all of a sudden, like he's been found out, and she frowns.

""What's going on, Harry?"" She asks gently, and he shrugs.

""Just thinking.""

""Stop thinking. Your face goes all funny."" She says, pointing the end of her spoon at Harry before going back to her lunch, and she misses Harry and James trading a look, Harry proud and James puzzled.

The landline Lily regularly forgets she still has rings loudly, at around six thirty in the morning, and she picks up groggily. ""What?""

""Oh, sorry."" A familiar voice comes on the line, followed by the quiet, sheepish laughter that's been haunting her dreams since that lunch a month ago. That lunch was followed by more lunches, all of which were equally entertaining (Harry is quite a good singer and will perform at the drop of a hat) and frustrating (James Potter, unfortunately, seemed to only be getting hotter) by turns. ""Bad timing?""

""No, not at all."" Lily says, trying to stifle a yawn. ""I'm not going to ask where you got my phone number, because I don't think you want me to. So what's going on?""

""Harry won't be in to school today."" James says, slowly, as if he is picking and choosing his words as he speaks. ""There's a religious thing, for his mum, and we'll need to be there for the day.""

""That's nice."" Lily says. She's got no idea why she's this bothered by the thought of them leaving, even for just a short while. ""Tell his mum hello for me, then, and that his handwriting is excellent.""

""I can't, actually."" James says, the tone of his voice shifting. ""She's dead.""

""Oh."" Lily snaps to wakefulness with the abruptness of the remark. ""I'm so sorry for your loss.""

""It's been a few years. I'm alright."" He says, and Lily can tell it's more something he wants her to believe than the truth. ""Just wanted to let you know so you wouldn't worry, yeah? He might be a little difficult tomorrow, just warning ahead. He'll be fine, though, no worries.""

""Thanks, James."" She says softly. ""I'm glad you let me know. You be fine too, alright?""

""Can't make any promises, but it'd be wrong to lie to a pretty girl."" James says, sounding a little happier. ""I'll do my best.""

""See you soon, then."" Lily says, with a smile. He's called her pretty. What a nerd. ""You can come to me with anything. Really. We're friends and all, right?""

She can hear James breathing on the line, imagines the frown on his face, the way his eyebrows draw together when he is thinking and the way he worries his bottom lip between his teeth, and she is so lost in the image in her head that she nearly misses his answer.

""Yeah, Evans. We're friends."" He says, and then ends the call after a quick goodbye.

The words buzz in her chest, keeping her awake, and half an hour later, she hears a car start next door and pull out of the driveway.

Her boys, she thinks, before frowning. When did they become her boys?

They're both back on her doorstep two days later (she can tell by the way they're ringing the doorbell-- both Harry and James are competing to press it, judging by the shuffling feet and whimpers outside), and she couldn't believe how much she'd missed them. She'd seen them when James dropped Harry off, of course, and during pickup, but that wasn't really seeing a person, as far as Lily was concerned.

She opens the door, smiling at the sight of Harry, and is about to say hello when he cuts her off.

""Appa thinks you're cute and you should totally go to dinner with him and just him! Uncle Sirius'll watch me and it'll totally be cool! I promise!"" Harry blurts out, before looking to James. ""Oh. I was supposed to say hi first. Hi.""

""That's quite the proposition."" She says, looking at James, who looks like someone's punched him in the gut. ""I quite prefer a guy who doesn't need a five year old's help to ask me out, though.""

""Ooh."" Harry giggles. ""Appa got burned. Maybe that's why he said you were hot.""

""Hari."" James hisses, rubbing his forehead. ""Stop!""

""Any last words, Mr. Potter?"" Lily asks, solemnly, and James seems to get his confidence back at that.

""Yeah. Tomorrow night. My place. Just us."" James says, trying to school his face into something neutral. He's failing miserably, and Lily can tell he's the rip the bandaid off type by the way he keeps pushing forward. ""We'll talk.""

""Sounds good."" Lily says, and then something occurs to her. ""Do you want to come in?""

Harry shucks off his shoes before running through the gap between Lily's side and the door, and James pulls his off carefully, leaving them beside Harry's, before stepping into the house.

""Nice place, you've got."" He says, smiling at Lily, and she nods. Harry is around the corner, probably up to his ears in trouble, but he is out of sight, so James capitalizes on the opportunity and plants a kiss on Lily's lips before running to find his son.  Lily stands in the doorway, completely and utterly confused, but closes and locks the door before going after them.

There's no telling what they'll do, and, thankfully, she's here to stop it. 

Seeing him at school on Monday is odd, after that, because all she can think of is the fact that he'd kissed her in her doorway, and James seems to be thinking along the same lines, not making eye contact for too long, and dropping Harry off during the busiest part of the morning drop off so they wouldn't have to talk.

He waits a little longer to show up that evening, though, just long enough for Lily to deliver the kids with a longer wait for their parents to the after school program teachers, and Harry picks an abandoned section of playground to climb while James pretends holding Lily's hand doesn't make him nervous, and Lily pretends she isn't worried that someone will see them. They feel oddly like a family already, and Lily realizes why Harry's eyes looked so familiar to her that first day when she looks in the mirror that night, by accident, while brushing her teeth.

Harry's eyes look just like hers. 

Harry, according to James, has spent the last week telling all of James' friends that he's ""gotten his Appa a girlfriend and she's the bestest in the world"". Lily laughs, when she hears the news, and asks if his friends are interested in meeting the bestest in the world.

She stops in her tracks afterward, worried that she's being too forward, and relaxes when she hears him laugh, soft and easy.

""They'll love you for that."" He says, smiling wider than she ever thought possible. ""I'll figure out a day.""

""Oh, but do you?"" She asks, teasingly, poking him in the chest, and James clears his throat awkwardly, muttering something in a language she can't understand, before saying the one word she wasn't expecting.

""Yes.""

""Well, damn."" She says, after a long pause. ""That's big.""

""I'm sorry, I know I get too forward like this, I mean, this is always why people break up with me, 'cause I get way too ahead of myself and--"" James is wringing his hands, and she just wants to kiss this frustrating, weird man and she has no idea why.

""James. Shut up. I love you too."" She says, and does.

""I love you three!"" Harry yells, from the bathroom, and James pulls away to tell him to ""finish pissing, thanks"", and everything is perfect. 

""So, where's the lucky lady?"" Sirius asks, the minute he steps into the house, and then sniffs the air. ""Radish sambar, nice!""

""That'd be me."" Lily says, looking up from the reading homework she's helping Harry with. He's been mixing up letter sounds, lately, but she's more inclined to believe it's just the product of switching between languages so much. The boys don't speak English much, if at all, when she's not around, from what she understands, and it's tough for Harry to switch back and forth, especially when it comes to things like reading and writing. ""Try that bit again. I'll go talk to your Uncle Sirius.""

""Not me?"" A brown haired man in a ragged looking cardigan asks, and Lily laughs.

""Definitely not you, Remus. Definitely not you.""

""I love her."" Sirius says, awestruck. ""Can we all share her? Or is she yours or something?""

""Mine."" James says, looking to Lily for confirmation. She shrugs, and his expression brightens. ""I don't have to share, 'cause I'm good looking.""

""I look like Appa, so I don't need to share!"" Harry says, looking quite delighted, and Lily slaps a hand over her eyes. Remus seems to share her opinion, and by the end of the night, they're all talking like they're old friends.

It's a nice feeling, Lily thinks, as she goes back to her house after dinner. Warm, and comforting. Her house feels empty now, when the boys aren't in it. It's almost foreign, not having people around, and she doesn't know why.

So she calls up James, after she's sure Harry's fallen asleep, and they talk until Lily is yawning and James says ""babe, just stay over next time"" and she says ""sure, if you're okay"". James jokes about how Harry would want to sleep wherever she is, if she stayed the night, and Lily says that might not be such a bad thing, because then James would have to come along, and she falls asleep to him telling her she better enjoy cuddling, because that's practically a Potter family Olympic level sport.

""Love you"", he says softly, after he knows she's asleep. ""I mean it.""

Lily Evans snores.

The last day of school is a too warm day in July, and nearly all the kids are sweaty messes by the time the day ends. She hugs them all in turn, tells all their parents what splendid kids they are and how well they're going to do in first grade, and then it comes time for the last parent.

""So, I hear you're not his teacher anymore."" James Potter says, picking up Harry's backpack. ""That's fun.""

Harry grins, hanging tightly onto Lily's hand. ""You're much better than a teacher now.""

""I guess I am."" Lily says, with a laugh, and the next time an old lady at the supermarket tells them they're such a cute family, not one of them corrects her.

She sticks cherries on top of the cake that's meant to impress his father's business associate, humming quietly under her breath and telling Harry to go into his room like he's told. Harry grabs a piece of bread and shrugs.

""Mum?""

""Yes, Diddykins?"" She wipes her hands with her apron and ruffles his hair.

""Why can't Harry help?""

His mother clicks her tongue and caresses his cheek. ""You shouldn't worry about that, honey. Now, what do you have to do when our guests come?""

It only occurs to Dudley that she didn't answer his question when Harry drops the cake on Mrs Mason's head, a wild look on his face, his fingers like claws. Dudley's father starts screaming and Harry grows even smaller than he already is. Dudley shifts in his seat. (the letter Harry gets makes it worse)

If his mother is honey, then his father is like fire licking at their skin, warm and calming and hot in Dudley's guts (burning Harry's dark skin and the scar on his face, yelling and fleeing all across the country from letters). Dudley stares at the batter and sugar on the floor and all over his mother's good seat cushions and thinks about the Boa constrictor from a year ago.

It's Harry's birthday and no one has said a thing.

 

 

So, when his parents have gone to sleep, after bars have been put in front of Harry's window and his mother has locked the door to his room, their faces in sneers, Dudley sneaks out of his room, worrying his hands. His mother's keys hang next to the door and Dudley grabs them all, his hands sticky.

The fifth key fits into the keyhole and as he turns it he can hear the rustling of sheets. He opens the door. Harry is clutching his wand, the blanket bunched up at his feet. ""What are you doing here?"", he asks, his voice a quiet whisper and Dudley shrugs.

""I stole mum's keys"", he says and closes the door behind himself. Harry furrows his brows. The owl in the cage hoots and Dudley turns his head to look at it. It's a snow owl, fluffing its feathers and snapping its beak at him.

""What's his name?"", he asks. Harry doesn't lower his wand.

""Hedwig"", he says, his voice thick with sleep.

""She looks uncomfortable in there.""

""You think?""

Dudley worries his lower lip between his teeth and tosses the keys from one hand to another. ""I don't have a birthday present for you"", he says finally and Harry laughs. Dudley elbows him in the ribs.

""No, I mean, I just realised that I've never given you a birthday present."" He runs his hands over the keys. ""And neither have mum or dad.""

Harry says nothing.

 

 

The next morning, Dudley grabs the spare change from the jar in the kitchen and the telephone book and walks all the way to Collinson Road until he finds a phone box.

After three rings, his religion teacher picks up. ""This is Mrs Langford speaking, who's there?""

""Hi, this is, erm, Dudley Dursley.""

Silence. Dudley shifts his weight from one foot to another. ""You had me in second period on Monday this year? I'm in class with Piers Polkiss?""

""Oh!"" A laugh. ""Yes, of course, how can I help you?""

""You said last year that if we had any hypothe-"", he frowns, ""hypothetitical, no that's not it either-""

""Hypothetical questions?"" She sounds amused and Dudley nods.

""Yes that! I have one! So, say someone had -"", he hesitates, ""- abilities that could hurt people, and he went to a school studying these abilities, is it the responsible thing to do to lock him in a room?"" He thinks of Harry's thin fingers and of the owl in her cage.

Mrs Langford hums. ""How old is this hypothetical person?""

""As old as me."" He twirls the cord between his fingers.

""Well, has he ever used these abilities to willingly hurt someone?""

Dudley thinks of regrown hair and disappearing glass and Harry's head in a headlock, thinks of Piers' smug grin. ""No"", he says.

""Dudley, I don't know what this is for but please know that if there's a problem you need to tell an adult, preferably your parents.""

Dudley's father's face grows red when he screams at Harry, grabs his arms and watches him squirm and his mother's voice is rotten honey and Dudley rests his head against the glass. ""Yes"", he says. ""I will.""

""Dudley"", Mrs Langford says slowly. ""What school does your cousin go to?""

Dudley hangs up. (He has ten pounds left. Enough to buy a lock pick.)

 

 

""Happy late birthday"", he says and hands Harry a box when he sneaks into his room again. Harry hasn't drawn his wand this time.

(They let Hedwig out of the cage and Dudley runs downstairs to get Harry something to eat and Dudley feels a little less sticky when Harry smiles at him.)"

She and James gave Harry his first Pumpkin Pasty that morning, and he bit into it with his 3 teeth and smiled, and she looked at James, and he looked at her, and everything was a little bit perfect. 


 


Now Lily was looking into the cold, unforgiving gaze of a man who never loved. He wrapped his pale hand a little tighter around his wand and stared straight at her and she wanted to crumple up into a ball.


 


""James Potter is dead.""


 


Lily choked on a sob. James was dead. James, the sunniest, brightest, most animated person she ever knew was lying on the floor somewhere downstairs, and his warm brown eyes were now empty bits of glass in his head. James was gone now. He was twenty-one and his whole life was laid out before him, but now he was gone and could never come back. 


 


Lily thought of all the things that were going to happen. James was going to be an auror, making the world safer for everyone like he always wanted to. He was going to celebrate Deepavali with Harry, and he was going to teach Harry how to ride his first real broom. He was the one who cooked for them, and he was going to learn all her mother's recipes for her. He was going to spend every full moon for the rest of his life running with Remus, and he was going to be Sirius's brother when he needed one. He was going to be the best man at Remus and Sirius's wedding someday, if it ever became legal. He was going to bake cookies for Peter.


 


But none of that would happen. Not anymore. Because James was dead.


 


""I'm not here to kill you, Lily,"" Voldemort said, ""You do not have to die tonight. You can start a new life, be someone else. You can live, Lily."" She paused. The Death Eaters did not like to leave survivors, not when you could exterminate a whole blood-traitor family in one go. ""I am here for him."" He pointed one long, bony finger at her son, her precious boy, the best thing in the whole world as far as she could see. 


 


""No,"" Lily gasped, ""You can't take him. You can't have him. Kill me, kill me instead!"" The oddly serene look that had been on Voldemort's face morphed into one of fury. 


 


""Silly girl! Move aside!"" Voldemort pointed his wand at her and recited the incantation she knew so well from the battlefield. She saw it coming and she screamed with all the energy she had in her body. It struck her and suddenly she was falling, falling down something she couldn't see the end to.


 


There is a short moment before death where you have time to think, just for a second. At least he has Remus and Padfoot, Lily thought. They would be good parents- Sirius would make sure Harry would have fun and be happy and free, and Remus would teach Harry all the things he would need to know, and make sure he didn't get into too much trouble. If Sirius raised him, he would probably be the bane of McGonagall's existence, but she would love him anyway, in that way she did all of the self-proclaimed Marauders. Peter- oh Peter, how could that little rat have done this- he would go to Azkaban, probably, and she didn't want that for him, but he killed James, and he killed her. Harry would be okay, she told herself. Everything would be okay. She needed it to be okay. She loved him so much, more than anyone else, and she needed him to be okay. It was all going to be okay, she thought, and then the world fell around her and it all went dark.


 


The worst thing is that Lily knew it wasn't really okay. Everyone was a little bit wrong, in a way. There was no castle in the clouds, or gilded palace, and there was no bearded man. She was there with James, and they couldn't see what happened out in the world. They didn't know what was happening to Harry, not really, and that was terrifying. She got glimpses, right after she died, but after that she saw nothing. She saw Severus enter her home, clutching her lifeless body, and she felt distinctly uncomfortable. She saw him ignore her Harry as he wailed and cried and watched an adult who didn't care about him. She saw Sirius arrive and yell at Severus, telling him not to disrespect her corpse. She saw him pick up Harry and wrap him in his coat, rocking him and gently pressing a kiss to the new spidery scar on his forehead. Oh Merlin, her son defeated Voldemort. Her baby. Then she saw Hagrid come and take the baby from Sirius, taking him to Albus, probably. She saw the funeral, where Remus stood stranded without his brothers. She saw the dirt that covered her grave fall upon her, and she saw nothing more, beyond feelings and ideas of what happened.


 


They were all so broken, now. Sirius was in prison, and Peter escaped, and Remus was all alone in a world that would tear him into bits more than he himself already did. She and James were in some sort of after, not knowing what was happening anymore beyond vague feelings, and Harry was left without his family. 


 


Harry.


 


He was going to grow up alone, thinking he is dirty and freakish and wrong. He wasn't going to know any different, either. Lily wanted to cradle him in her arms just one more time, and she knew James wanted to give him one last kiss, but neither would ever happen.


 


Because Halloween was over, and they were dead.

This in itself wasn't particularly unusual. Harry, like many young boys, had often thought about leaving home. After all, being able to go wherever they wanted, without anyone telling them what to do, was the dream of many children.

Harry Potter probably thought about it more often than most though. He thought about it whenever his uncle shouted at him, or whenever his aunt sneered at him. He thought about it when his cousin and his gang chased him so they could try to stuff his head down the toilet, and whenever his teachers looked at him with vapid expressions of pity.

In short, Harry Potter had thought about it nearly every day for the past seven years.

The difference between Harry and all the other children with similar dreams was that Harry was perfectly capable of carrying making his dream a reality.

Harry had been planning his escape for a long time, but recent events had forced his hand. It wasn't unusual for Harry to get far better reports from his teachers than his cousin Dudley. It also wasn't difficult, considering Dudley had the intelligence of a juvenile rabbit, but for some reason Vernon and Petunia had never gotten used to it. They had taken to ignoring it after even their most severe threats failed to get Harry to dumb himself down, but this year they couldn't ignore the rather pointed note attached to Harry's report from his headmistress. Miss Pevensie was old but she wasn't stupid, and she wasn't blind enough to miss the differences between loud, spoiled Dudley and his little ghost of a cousin. Harry had been sent to his cupboard the second Vernon had seen the letter, but his uncle's shouts about child services and reports of abuse had been impossible to ignore.

Harry didn't care. Maybe the authorities would help, but they never had before and he had no intention of taking his chances.

So the next morning, Harry decided that enough was enough. He left his schoolbooks behind, instead packing the few tolerable clothes he possessed into his small rucksack. There was nothing else he cared to take; everything he owned had been broken by Dudley before being passed on to him. He dressed in his school uniform, and looked round his cupboard for the last time.

Really, Harry hadn't had to stay in the cupboard. Young as he was, there were plenty ways he could have persuaded or intimidated his relatives into giving him Dudley's spare room. In the end though he hadn't bothered with the effort. He had never been planning on staying long, and the less the Dursleys knew about what he could do the better. More importantly, the less the other authorities knew about his abilities the better.

Harry wasn't stupid. He might know very little about how his world worked in this time, but no society would be so idiotic as to leave children with their power unsupervised. Any intentional displays of magic would undoubtedly attract attention, and that would lead to questions that Harry had no desire to answer.

For example, how he knew about magic at all.

Harry snorted softly. That question alone could cause utter chaos. Much better to wait until he had more information

A sharp rap on the door woke Harry from his thoughts.

""Hurry up, or you'll be late, boy.""

Harry's lip curled, but he opened the door without comment. Petunia sneered down at him. ""You've missed breakfast, but that can't be helped. We're leaving now.""

Harry said nothing. He just met her pale blue eyes with his green ones until the sneer faded into something more uncertain. Petunia's lips thinned, but instead of scolding him, she just shook her head sharply. ""Don't be late.""

She hurried Dudley out the door with far more haste than normal, and Harry was gratified to see a gleam of fear and confusion in her eyes as she glanced back over her shoulder. Then the door slammed shut and Harry was alone in the house.

Vernon hadn't been happy, but after Dudley threw four tantrums in a row about the freak walking into school with him, he had agreed that Harry would leave five minutes after Dudley and Petunia each morning. Harry hadn't particularly minded; any time away from Dudley was fine by him, and he had been amused by how quickly the teachers picked up on their unusual situation, but he appreciated the arrangement now.

It was tempting to leave a suitable farewell for the Dursleys, but Harry resisted the impulse. He wanted as good a head start as he could get before the chaos started. Not that it really mattered, considering where he was going, but it would draw things out for his charming relatives. Instead, Harry headed up to the attic.

One of the first things Harry could remember was Petunia telling him never to go into the attic. Naturally, it was one of the first things Harry had done, once he was strong enough. The place was full of Vernon and Petunia's rubbish, but there were a few items of interest. Harry shoved a stack of Dudley's old pre-school work out the way until he spotted the box of dusty photo albums poking out from under a bag of old clothes. He was keen to leave as soon as possible, but he had never been able to resist the urge to take a look.

Harry carefully picked up one of the more faded albums and opened it. Two smiling Muggles beamed up at him, and Harry felt his own lips twitch up. The photo was in black and white, but he knew from other photos that his grandmother's eyes were exactly the same colour as his own. Both of his grandparents were white though, so Harry's own skin and hair colour had presumably come from his father's side. That was all Harry knew about his father, but he pushed that thought to one side. There would be information about him somewhere, and Harry had no intention of stopping until he found it.

Reluctantly, Harry set that album aside and found the more recent ones. These ones were all in colour, and there was a familiar tightness in Harry's chest as he looked at his mother's face. If he hadn't found these photos, Harry wouldn't even have known her name. He thanked every god he knew that someone had recorded the date and people present on the back of each photo. There were some of Lily and Petunia as small children, sometimes with a tiny wrinkled old woman who Harry assumed was his great-grandmother, and then there were some of Lily as a young lady, laughing and carefree, with her whole future before her.

Harry's fingers trembled as he traced his mother's face. What had happened? He knew absolutely nothing about their lives. He didn't know why they had met their deaths by the Killing Curse, if that was the green light in his nightmares was, or why he had been placed with people who might be his blood relatives but still loathed him simply for who he was. He didn't know why none of their friends had ever tried to check on him.

Harry didn't have answers to those questions. But he was going to find out.

For now though, he had wasted enough time. He raided the albums for his favourite pictures, and placed the photos carefully in a plastic wallet he'd taken from Dudley's school supplies. He needed them more than Petunia did. Harry cast a final quick glance round, then settled his rucksack more comfortably on his shoulders and closed his eyes.

It wasn't the best idea he had ever had. Apparition was tricky even for a grown wizard. Harry remembered all too vividly the last time he had tried it at this young age, but he forced the memories away with a shudder. Thinking about that wouldn't help. He was tempted to wait a few more months, just to let his magic stabilise, but he dismissed the thought almost immediately. The situation with the Dursleys had become intolerable, and Harry knew he could do this. He had before after all.

So Harry Potter summoned up all the magic he possessed and concentrated on the one place he could truly call home.

There was the familiar awful-wonderful twisting wrenching bending stretching sensation then Harry landed on cold stone and his mind burst into song.

'Welcome home, Salazar!""

Salazar Slytherin, founder of Hogwarts, now nearly nine year old Harry Potter closed his eyes and let the magic of Hogwarts surround him. Wards wrapped around him as easily as if a day had passed rather than a thousand years, and tears fell unheeded as Hogwarts' love and respect soothed his battered mind and soul.

'Thank you,' he finally managed. 'It is good to be home.'

Hogwarts seemed to hum louder, and for a minute Harry let himself just bask in the warmth of her welcome. It had been so long since anyone had treated him with more than wary pity.

But there was something he had to know.


'Have any of the others been here?'


There was a heavy sigh and Harry's heart sank even before the soft whisper sounded. 'Only you.'

Harry drew in a deep, shuddering breath. Where could they be? He couldn't do this without them. He rubbed fiercely at his eyes and tried to think. He had made no plans to be reborn after his death, and he wouldn't have had time to carry out any rituals anyway, considering the nature of his demise. That meant that someone, be it a god, the fates, or even magic itself, had intervened.

Whoever it was, they had to have brought the others back too. Harry didn't know what was going on, but he did know that he couldn't do it alone. He needed his family.

But if they weren't here, where were they?

'They may not be old enough,' Hogwarts pointed out. 'Witches and wizards do not come here until they are eleven now, and you are younger than that.'

Harry sat back and nodded. 'You're right. I just hope they get here soon.' If they didn't... His mind shied away from the possibility.

'The new school year starts in six weeks,' Hogwarts offered. 'One or all of them might arrive then.'

'I hope so,' said Harry quietly.

Hogwarts wrapped his mind in another gentle hug, and Harry leaned into the contact. 'You are not alone, Salazar. You will never be alone.'

Harry smiled. He knew he was right. He took a deep breath, then got to his feet. He couldn't sit around waiting for his friends for the next six weeks. He might be only a child, but there was still plenty he could do. Especially here in Hogwarts.

There was one immediate matter to deal with. 'What happened in here?'

Harry had decided to land in the Chamber of Secrets out of sheer practicality. He hadn't been sure when the holidays for Hogwarts would be, and hadn't wanted to risk landing in the middle of a crowded corridor. As the Chamber was hidden, and sealed to any but a Parselmouth, it had seemed the most suitable location.

Which it was. It was also half flooded with water.

'Ah,' said Hogwarts. There was a clear note of embarrassment in her voice. 'Well, things got a little complicated when the Muggles invented plumbing. One of Selene's descendants had to rework the entire system.'

Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. 'Right. I'll deal with that later. What about Issa?'

'She is well,' Hogwarts assured him. 'But she is very old, and sleeps a great deal.'

Harry smiled. 'I'm not surprised. I'll wake her once I settle in.' He looked around and sighed. 'Looks like I'll be staying in the Room of Requirement after all.' He would make time to come down and visit Issa later, and he would also have to make sure his wards on the rest of the Chamber had held. There were things down here that were never meant to see the light of day again.

But that could wait for another day. Harry climbed to his feet, picked up his rucksack, and willed himself to the Room of Requirement.

Harry reappeared in an exact replica of his old chambers, and smiled. 'Thank you.'

'My pleasure,' Hogwarts replied.

Harry let out a contented sigh as he shrugged out of his rucksack. He had missed Hogwarts, and he had missed having his own space, and it was so good to be home. 'Have any students found this place yet?'

'Not for many years,' said Hogwarts with a chuckle. 'Even the teachers have only ever stumbled across it by accident.'

Harry smirked. 'Rowena will be pleased to hear that.' He started taking his clothes out of his rucksack, then paused. Looking at the stained and baggy cast-offs made him think of the Dursleys, and he had no intention of thinking about those people unless he absolutely had to. 'Do we still keep spare robes?'

There was a slight pause before Hogwarts replied. 'We do. But, Salazar, there is a house-elf outside who wishes to speak with you.'

Harry closed his eyes for a moment. 'I should have expected that.' He set the clothes down on the bed and took a deep breath. 'Let them in.'

Hogwarts touched his mind in a brief second of comfort, then the door swung open to reveal an old house-elf. He was dressed in a clean tea towel with the Hogwarts crest on it, and his eyes went as wide as saucers when he caught sight of Harry. Harry smiled and knelt down so they were at eye level.

""Hello,"" he said gently. ""Please come in. What is your name?""

The house-elf visibly swallowed and took a few steps into the room. ""I is called Pento,"" he said.

Harry nodded. ""It's nice to meet you, Pento. Why are you here?""

Pento hesitated, then lifted his head to meet Harry's gaze properly. ""We house-elves felt the old Master return,"" he said clearly. ""We did not understand, but we are here to serve, and serve we will, if that is Master's wish.""

For a moment, Harry could only stare at him. The house-elves were bound to Hogwarts, and so Harry had guessed that they would be alerted to his presence, but he hadn't expected them to recognise him. Pento's ears fell. ""Have we displeased, Master?"" he asked tentatively.

Harry blinked and shook his head. ""No, Pento. Not at all."" He took a breath. ""Thank you for your service. All I ask is that you do not tell anyone that I am here.""

Pento nodded vigorously. ""I understand, Master."" He gave Harry a warm smile. ""All of Hogwarts is happy that you is home.""

Harry suddenly found it impossible to speak around the lump in his throat. ""I'm very happy to be home too, Pento.""

Pento tilted his head to one side, and studied Harry for a long minute. ""Master needs looking after,"" he said suddenly. ""Master has not been happy in a long time."" His eyes narrowed as they took in Harry's clothes. ""Pento will send elves to help Master."" He bowed very low, then disappeared with a loud crack.

Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head. He had forgotten how protective house-elves could be of masters they felt deserved it. Not for the first time he mentally thanked Helga for being so passionate in her advocacy of house-elf rights. He, Godric and Rowena had learned easily as much from her as she had from them. None of them had treated house-elves badly to begin with, all their families having taught them better than that, but Helga was something else.

The thought of his friends sent a sharp pang through Harry's chest. He missed them more than he could say. His hands curled into fists, and he felt Hogwarts' silent support. He would find them again. No matter how long it took.

In the meantime, however, he had a lot of catching up to do.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Albus Dumbledore frowned.

Unlike some of his colleagues, frowning was not Albus' expression of choice. He much preferred to solve problems with twinkling eyes, a genial smile, and enough nonsense that people ended up too confused to argue. However, while that method worked very well on witches, wizards, Muggles, and anyone else who happened to argue with him, it was far less effective on inanimate objects.

Which was why Albus was reduced to frowning at the small silver device lying motionless on his desk.

Albus had many such devices. Most were tied to the Hogwarts wards, or were alarms relating to his various other positions. Being Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, for example, dictated that he could always be contacted in case of an emergency. This one, however, was different. It was the only tied to a specific individual. It was extremely basic, Albus had felt uncomfortable with even a limited breach of privacy, but when the individual in question was Harry Potter, Albus had reluctantly decided that the intrusion was necessary. He had done his best to limit it though. All the device told him was that Harry was within his relatives' wards, and that he was safe.

In all the time Harry had been with the Dursleys the device had never so much as twitched. That lunchtime though, Albus had returned to his office after a long session in court to find the silver glowing a soft amber. Since Albus had set it to turn bright crimson if Harry was ever in real danger, Albus had been confused, but not particularly alarmed.

That had changed when he investigated further and found that the wards on Number 4 Privet Drive had shattered beyond repair. Albus had been on the verge of immediately Apparating to Little Whinging, when he realised that, despite the state of the blood wards, all indications were that Harry Potter was not in danger. In fact, he was as safe as he had ever been.

Albus rested his chin on his fingertips and considered the matter. Harry was safe. That was the most important thing. However, something had clearly happened at Privet Drive, and Albus had to find out what. He was just debating whether to ask Minerva to visit or to go in person when the entire castle was rocked by a pulse of pure magic and every alarm on Albus' desk started screaming.

Albus was on his feet immediately, drawing on his connection with the wards in an attempt to find the source of the outburst, but his mind was racing. All the students had left the previous week, along with most of the teachers. Even Argus had gone to Cornwall for the holidays. The only people currently in the castle were himself, Minerva, and the house-elves, and none of them should be capable of this. He reached out, but another burst of magic made him stagger back with a cry.

Anger, pain, despair, fury... The emotions tore through the castle with such ferocity that Albus had to break his connection. He leaned on the desk, his head pounding and thoughts whirling. Who could possibly be responsible for this? And how?

From what seemed like a very great distance he heard footsteps, then the door was flung open.

""Albus, what is going on?""

Albus shook his head, and straightened up in time to meet Minerva McGonagall's anxious gaze. ""I do not know,"" he said flatly. ""I cannot isolate the source of the disturbance.""

Minerva stared at him. ""What? How is that possible?""

Albus could only shake his head again. He hated not knowing something, but this was beyond anything he had ever experienced. Minerva took a step closer. ""All the ghosts can feel it,"" she said. ""I passed Sir Nicholas and the Friar on the way up. In all these years I've never seen them so agitated.""

Albus rubbed at his eyes. ""I am not surprised. Whoever is doing this has some connection to Hogwarts, but I cannot for the life of me understand how.""

The thought was more than a little terrifying. He waited for Minerva's input, but his deputy didn't reply. Albus frowned. ""Minerva?""

Minerva was staring out the window, her eyes as wide as saucers. ""Albus,"" she whispered.

Albus followed her gaze, and his mouth fell open. The previously blue skies were now dark with thick storm clouds, and trees were whipping to and fro in a ferocious gale. Even as the two stunned professors watched, the heavens opened and rain began to fall, lightly at first, but soon it was coming down in heavy sheets. Lightning lit the sky, followed almost immediately by a dull rumble of thunder, and Minerva turned her dazed face towards him.

""What in the name of Merlin is going on?""

Deep in the library, Harry Potter was heedless of the devastation he was causing. He was staring at the books in front of him, his hands curled into fists, and shaking so hard he could barely think.

""Hated Muggles and Muggleborns,"" he spat. ""Hid a monster in the school to murder them all.""

'Salazar,' Hogwarts tried, but Harry barely heard her.

""Left the school after duelling Godric over blood purity!""


'Salazar-'


""Slytherin is the home of Dark wizards in training, Gryffindors are heroes, Ravenclaws are know-it-alls, and Hufflepuffs are too pathetic to go anywhere else?""

Harry gave up trying to control himself. Every window in the library shattered, and the books in front of him went flying. Harry felt Hogwarts trying to get his attention, but the storms was free now and he threw himself into it. All the rage and horror and despair of the last hour overflowed, and all Harry could do was ride it out.

It didn't take long. Harry's young body simply couldn't channel the magic necessary for maintaining a storm of that intensity. Bare minutes later the thunder and lightning died, and the rain was fading to a light drizzle, and Harry was drained to the point of numbness.

""How did this happen?"" he whispered.

It wasn't true. None of it. Yes, he had hated Muggles, but they had murdered his family right before him! They had condemned their own kin simply because they were different. And there were so many others. Helga had done nothing but help the people of her village, and they had nearly killed her for it. If Salazar hadn't been there... And how many others had died because Muggles hated anyone who wasn't exactly like them?

Harry forced himself to breathe deeply. Yes, he had been wary of Muggleborns, but Helga had opened his eyes. After all, Muggleborns were even more at risk from Muggles than pure bloods or half-bloods. At least those with magical heritage knew what was going on, and how to control their powers. Muggleborns hadn't been nearly so lucky.

That was why it had been so important that Hogwarts be a refuge for all children with magic. Salazar had never argued with that. He certainly wouldn't have fought Godric and let the school over it.

That was another thing Harry couldn't understand. He and Godric had fought all the time, but that was what brothers did. They understood each other, and the duel that day had been nothing out of the ordinary. It was pure bad luck that Salazar had been killed before he had had a chance to return.

Harry shivered, and forced that memory aside. He knew better than to think about his death.

But how could anyone think he would willingly leave his home? Or the only real family he had ever had?

Harry stared round at the destruction he had caused, and choked back a sob. How had everything gone so wrong?

There was a very tentative brush against his mind, and Harry flinched.

""Sorry,"" he whispered.

He was instantly engulfed in a warm mental hug, and Harry had to smile. Hogwarts, at least, didn't care what the books said about him. She knew the truth. And so would his friends.

In the meantime, he couldn't afford to lose control again. Harry sighed, and with the last of his concentration repaired the broken windows with a wave of his hand. The effort left him dizzy, and he made a mental note to obtain a wand as soon as possible. From what he had gathered he was too young to go out and buy one, and the gods only knew what had happened to his original ones, but there were bound to be some in the Room of Requirement. With any luck one would suit his needs well enough until he could disguise himself and buy one properly.

Until then, he would just have to be careful. Sighing, Harry dragged his aching body out of the chair and began to gather up the scattered books. Considering the chaos he had caused in the wards it was unlikely that Headmaster Dumbledore would be able to isolate his presence in the library, but there was no point in being overtly obvious.

But although Harry's rage had faded, he knew it would be a long time before he came to terms with what had happened to his name and house. After all, they had been the only things he had ever been truly proud of. Without those, what was he?

One thing Harry was certain of though, was that he was going to make this right.

""Anything?""

Albus blew out an exhausted breath and sat back in his chair. ""I am afraid not.""

Minerva sank down into the chair opposite him and fixed him with a concerned look. ""Albus, how could someone be in Hogwarts and affecting the wards so severely without you being alerted to it?""

Albus shook his head slowly. ""I do not know,"" he said slowly. ""The only thing I can think of is that the intruder was not a threat to this school?""

""Not a threat?"" Minerva exclaimed. ""Albus, you felt that power!""

""I did,"" Albus confirmed. ""But I also felt that power being carefully diverted away from the house-elves, and even from us."" Minerva opened her mouth, but Albus held up a hand. ""I truly do not believe that this intruder intended any harm to anyone in this castle.""

Minerva's eyes narrowed. ""And what about that storm?"" she demanded. ""You can't tell me that was a normal occurrence?""

Albus shook his head. ""No,"" he agreed softly. ""That...that was something I thought impossible.""

While a degree of control over the elements were fairly common among talented wizards, every child in their world knew better than to play with the weather itself. Even Albus, powerful as he was, had never dared to meddle with such things. He had thought the stories of wizards who could do such things legends at most.

Minerva had gone very pale. ""But how could such a person come here undetected?""

""I don't know,"" said Albus quietly. ""But should they attempt to cause harm to anyone in this school, they will come to regret it.""

Minerva held his gaze for a minute, then let out a long breath. ""I will alert Filius, Pomona, and Severus to what has happened,"" she said. ""We will take it turns to stay, just in case.""

Albus smiled at her. ""Thank you, Minerva. This is one threat which may require all our strength.""

Minerva sighed. ""I just hope you are right, and that this person means us no harm."" She rose to her feet and straightened her green robes. ""If that is all, Albus?""

Albus made a split-second decision. ""Actually, Minerva, there was one other little matter.""

Very slowly, Minerva turned back to face him. ""I'm not sure I like the sound of this,"" she said grimly.

Albus winced mentally, but he hadn't been sorted into Gryffindor for nothing. ""It appears something has happened to Harry Potter.""

The look Minerva shot him could have frozen a Dementor in its tracks. Albus sighed and braced himself. This was not going to go well.

Harry was silent for several minutes as Hogwarts recounted the conversation between the Headmaster and his deputy. He was back in the Room of Requirement, nibbling from the 'light' lunch the house-elves had brought up for him. Honestly, sometimes he thought he was doomed to have people always demanding he put on weight, but there were more important things to be worrying about than people mothering him.

'Do you trust Dumbledore?' he asked, when Hogwarts finished.

'He would do anything for the students of this school,' Hogwarts replied immediately. 'He is intelligent and powerful, and is perhaps the only person that Voldemort ever feared.'

Harry's lip curled. He had come across Voldemort, and therefore himself, in the library, and the accounts he had read had very nearly triggered another outburst. Harry had long ago sworn to stop any Dark wizards who threatened innocents. Murdering Lily and James Potter had simply moved Voldemort to the top of the list. But at least Harry now knew how his parents had died, and why Dumbledore was so concerned about his disappearance.

What he didn't know, though, was why the man had sought to place him with his magic-hating relatives.


'He thought he was doing what was best for you.'


Harry sighed. Sometimes it was annoying how well Hogwarts knew him. 'He thought placing with me with people who hate the essence of what I am was best?'

'He did not make the decision lightly,' said Hogwarts pointedly. 'He and Minerva have had many discussions about it, but the fact remains that your mother's sacrifice created a very powerful form of protection.'

'I am familiar with blood wards,' Harry reminded her. 'And I can understand why he didn't want me growing up in the magical world.' He had read of the Death Eater attacks even after Voldemort's disappearance. Even hidden, he would have put any magical family who took him in at risk, and then there was the fact that vanquishing the most feared Dark wizard of their generation might well have gone to anybody's head. As much as Harry hated to admit it, he could understand Dumbledore's reasons for placing him with his Muggle relatives.

That didn't change the fact that said relatives were vastly unsuited to raising a magical child. If Harry hadn't faced much worse in his first life he might have snapped long ago.


'He still has plans for you.'


Harry just nodded. Dumbledore seemed like the sort of man who had to be in control, and if Voldemort really wasn't dead then the Headmaster was hardly likely to let his little saviour go his own way.

Harry wasn't sure if he and Dumbledore were going to agree on very much, but he did agree that Voldemort wasn't dead.


'What are you going to do?'


Harry took a deep breath. 'I'm not going back there. The wards when broke when I left; there'd be no point. And I'm not going to tell him where I am.'

Hogwarts' voice took on a reproachful edge. 'He's going to worry.'

Harry shrugged. 'He knows I'm alive. He'll know where I am when I start here in two years. Until then, it serves him right.'

If Hogwarts had eyes Harry had no doubt she'd be rolling them, but he didn't care. Dumbledore could try to control him all he wanted, but he was going to have at least a couple of years of peace.

Besides, he was allowed to be a bit vindictive. He was only eight after all.

Minerva McGonagall stared at the perfectly kept street and sighed.

Minerva didn't disapprove of the order. Unlike certain colleagues, she was quite capable of appreciating a neighbourhood where the residents clearly took pride in appearances. Magic was wonderful, certainly, but the quiet little Muggle street was pleasant enough.

Unfortunately, Minerva was very aware that some of the residents were not.

Honestly, she had never completely agreed with placing Harry with his relatives. She could understand Albus' reasoning; the boy had been safe here, and she had enough memories of what James Potter had been like when he first came to Hogwarts to be glad that his son wouldn't have the chance to let his fame go to his head, but she had still been uneasy. Minerva had met the entire Evans family when she introduced Lily to the magical world, and she was aware of the effect it had on Petunia. She had hoped the woman would have been able to look past her resentment, and maybe she would have, if her husband had not been equally disturbed by the wizards he had encountered. Minerva had loved James like a nephew, but he and Sirius Black were not the people she would have chosen to introduce Vernon Dursley to magic.

Minerva shivered, and shook her head sharply. There was nothing to be done about the past, but she could at least do something for their son now. Taking a deep breath, she strode up to Number 4 and rang the doorbell.

There was silence for a few seconds, then the door opened and Minerva came face to face with Petunia Evans for the first time in over thirty years.

Minerva felt a brief surge of pity. The awkward girl she had met all those years ago had grown into a tall woman with blonde hair, a long neck, and unfortunately large front teeth. Growing up with a sister like Lily couldn't have been easy for the poor woman. Petunia's pale eyes, so different from her sister's, widened.

""You!""

Minerva raised an eyebrow. ""It is a pleasure to see you again, Mrs. Dursley. May I come in?""

She didn't give the woman a chance to answer. She brushed past easily, taking in the strictly ordered hallway before entering the living room. That too was perfectly kept, but Minerva's eyes narrowed as she scanned the photographs decorating the walls and mantelpiece. There were many of Petunia, Vernon and their son, but none of a little boy with James' face and Lily's eyes. A dozen of Dudley Dursley, and not a single sign of any other boy living in the house.

Minerva couldn't blame Harry for running away in the slightest.

""He's not here.""

Minerva turned to see Petunia standing the doorway. Her thin arms were folded across her chest, and she was watching Minerva with undisguised wariness. ""The boy,"" she said, at Minerva's look. ""I assume that's why you're here.""

Minerva didn't bother to deny it. ""When did you last see him?""

""Yesterday morning, before we left for school,"" said Petunia curtly. ""He was late, so Dudley and I left without him.""

Minerva bit back the urge to point out that Harry was only eight years old. There were more important things to worry about. ""Did he go to school?""

""No."" Her lips pursed. ""The school called me, but he was gone by the time I got home. I thought he had gone with one of your lot.""

""Professor Dumbledore told you that it wasn't safe for him with us,"" Minerva pointed out. ""We had nothing to do with this.""

Petunia's eyes widened ever so slightly, before her expression closed and she looked away. ""We haven't seen him,"" she repeated. ""If he ever does come back, I will contact you."" The expression on her face made it quite clear that she wasn't expecting him to, but Minerva was slightly surprised by the fact that she would be willing to take him again.

""Can you tell me anything about him?"" she asked. ""It may help us to work out where he has gone.""

Petunia shook her head. ""He doesn't talk to us. Or to anyone, really.""

Minerva thought of how cheerful Lily always was, and how confident James had been and her chest ached. ""I see."" She considered pressing the matter, but Petunia was looking more and more tense with every passing moment. ""Thank you for your time, Petunia.""

Petunia twitched slightly at the use of her name, but jerked her head in acknowledgement. It wasn't until she had opened the door that she spoke. ""Do you know if he's safe?""

Minerva blinked, but covered her surprise quickly. ""He is,"" she assured the younger woman. ""We do not know exactly where he is, but we do know that he is not in any danger.""

Petunia held her gaze for a moment, then a little of the tension seemed to leave her body. ""Thank you."" Then the door shut, and Minerva was left alone on the doorstep.

Minerva sighed and began to head down the street. Petunia might care more for Harry than even she realised, but it was clear that the boy's childhood had not been a happy one. It really was no wonder he had left. Minerva was almost glad that they had no idea where he had gone; at least she wouldn't have to face sending him back to that place.

One thing was certain. If Harry Potter ever did return, Minerva was going to do whatever she could to make up for this.

Harry, meanwhile, was enjoying the best summer he had had in his current lifetime. Hogwarts was delighted to have him back, and the house-elves had welcomed him with open arms. Harry had been bemused at first, wondering why they weren't terrified at the sudden reappearance of the evil founder, but Hogwarts had set him straight.

'I know you are no threat,' she had said, when Harry finally worked out how to ask what was going on. 'And they are bound to me just as you are. Unless you completely change who you are, they will continue to trust you as completely as I do.'

Harry had been too touched by her words to speak, but the elves themselves had soon proven the castle right. Pento had assigned a young female elf called Teaky to look after him, and Teaky had taken her duties very seriously. She had been horrified at Harry's clothes, and had replaced all his ragged hand-me-downs with proper robes within two hours of meeting him, much to Harry's amusement and gratitude. She was also the main party responsible for the 'fatten up Harry' campaign, a mission that the other elves had taken very much to heart. After years of surviving off of the absolute basics, the attention was quite welcome, even if Harry had initially struggled with feelings of being smothered, but Teaky had made sure to give him the space he needed and the two soon got along as well as Harry ever had with the elves in his first life.

Not only was Harry being well-looked after, he also had plenty to keep him occupied. One of the first things he had done was to thoroughly review the wards and protective enchantments around the school. For the most part his work had survived remarkably well, but there was some inevitable damage from the last thousand years that Harry had immediately started planning to rectify. There were also traces of a nasty curse tied into one of the minor wards, but Harry had been unable to properly identify it without a wand.

Hence why finding a suitable wand was the other thing at the top of Harry's to-do list. And since going wandering around in his current appearance was hardly the best plan in the world, the Room of Requirement it was.

So the day after his relocation found Harry sitting on the floor at the foot of his bed staring out at the sea of wands in front of him.

""How could this many people be stupid enough to lose their wands?""

Hogwarts snorted. 'You know what students are like. Some were merely careless, others got new ones that fitted better and didn't care to dispose of their old ones properly. But really, Salazar, are you complaining?'

Harry had to smile. ""Not at all, my dear."" At least there was bound to be something he could work with. Shaking his head, Harry picked up the closest wand and set to work.

It took nearly an hour, but Harry finally settled on a ten inch wand made of pine. To his delight, it responded well to even non-verbal spells, and some more extensive tests proved it could handle all fields of magic more than willingly. Harry smiled at it as he collected the rest of the wands in a neat pile and tidied them away. Being without a wand had been without one of his limbs, and the new freedom the added versatility would grant him was euphoric.

There was one spell in particular he had wanted to try the moment he came across it the previous day. Harry stood up, concentrated hard, then flicked his wand in a circle around his head.

""Praetereo,"" he whispered.

The resulting sensation was peculiar to say the least. Harry felt like someone had doused him in cold water, but any discomfort was forgotten the moment he looked in the mirror and saw nothing but a faint outline. Harry reversed the charm and grinned at his reflection. ""I love magic.""

It took a couple more hours of practice, but Harry was eventually satisfied with his ability to perform the charm non-verbally so that would render him completely invisible, as long as he didn't make any sudden movements. Harry still wasn't sure how he had come to exist in this time and body, but if it gave him the chance to learn spells like that then he wasn't complaining in the slightest.

Armed with his wand and the Disillusionment Charm, Harry started to risk going further afield. He wandered the corridors of Hogwarts at will, and it was on these journeys that he caught his first glimpses of the current staff. Headmaster Dumbledore's unusual sense of style made him smile, but the sheer power he exuded left Harry confident that at least this Headmaster could protect their students. He was even more reassured by the kindness with which the man treated the house-elves though; that protection should extend to every inhabitant of the castle, and Dumbledore seemed to agree. Harry still wasn't happy with his own treatment at Dumbledore's hands, but he was willing to reserve judgement until he met the man properly.

Harry also found chances to observe the four heads of the houses. He approved of Professors McGonagall and Sprout, both of whom clearly knew exactly what they were doing, and who cared for the students just as much, if not more so, than Dumbledore did. He also liked Professor Flitwick, whose irrepressible nature and undeniable talent reminded him so much of Godric that Harry had to immediately flee to the Room of Requirement to get his emotions under control. It took him longer than he would have liked, but Harry was left with the confidence that Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were in good hands.

Slytherin, however, was another matter.

There was no doubt that Severus Snape was a very talented wizard. Harry could sense the power the man possessed, and he observed enough conversations undetected to see that Snape had the intelligence to match it. In those respects, he was worthy of leading Slytherin house. However, Harry could also feel the sharp bite of Dark magic that clung to the man, and he recognised the aura of bitterness and guilt all too well. It was a dangerous combination, and Harry decided to keep a very wary eye on Snape once the term started. He left the wizard's presence feeling uneasy, and more concerned than ever about the fate of his beloved house.

Harry wasn't left completely to his own devices though.

He had noticed the ghosts immediately, of course, and had been neither surprised nor annoyed by their presence. Ghosts were common enough in magical buildings, and Hogwarts was special even by magical standards. Besides, it made life more interesting for the students. He was less impressed that after ten centuries no one had managed to get rid of the bloody poltergeist, but at least the spirit limited itself to relatively harmless acts of mischief. All in all, Harry was quite content to avoid and ignore the spirit population of Hogwarts until he could risk appearing as an actual student.

At least, he was until he recognised one of the ghosts.

Harry had been on his way back from the library when he met her. The castle had been deserted but for the house-eves, Dumbledore away on one of his regular excursions, and Harry hadn't seen any need to waste energy Apparating around the school. He had been on his way up to the seventh floor when the ghost popped out of the wall in front of him.

Ordinarily Harry would have Apparated away immediately. He'd done it once before, and had been slightly concerned when the ghost's head nearly fell off, but he was quick enough that nothing had come of it. He had been preparing to do the same when he happened to look in the ghost's face and everything seemed to stop.

""Helena?""

The ghost of Helena Ravenclaw froze in mid-air before slowly turning to peer down at him. ""Who are you?"" she demanded. Her eyes ran over him, and her lips thinned. ""You are no student.""

Harry swallowed. He had never expected to see anyone from his past, at least not in the same guise as they had before, but Helena... She was older than he remembered, but she was there and all the years seemed to disappear.

""Child,"" he said softly. ""Do you not remember me?""

Helena stared. ""Who are you?"" she whispered. ""No one has called me that-""

""In ten centuries,"" said Harry softly. He tilted his head back, missing the days when she barely used to reach his knee, and looked her straight in the eye. ""Hello, Helena.""

If ghosts could pale, Helena would have done so. As it was, she jerked backwards, eyes widening. ""This...this is impossible... This is a joke. Peeves-!""

""You know better, Little One,"" said Harry.

It was the name only he had ever used for her, and it stopped her in her tracks. Slowly, very slowly, she dropped down until she could look Harry straight in the eye. ""S-Salazar?""

Harry managed a smile. ""Don't ask me how, but yes.""

Helena shook her head. ""This is impossible,"" she repeated. ""You died.""

Harry flinched. Her words conjured memories that were difficult to avoid. ""I know,"" he managed. ""And I am so, so sorry for leaving you all.""

Helena swallowed. ""Mother wept for you,"" she whispered. ""Helga broke, and Godric never smiled the way he used to. I...I missed you."" Her eyes searched his face. ""How are you back?""

Harry's eyes were stinging, and he had to stop to wipe away tears. ""I do not know,"" he said. ""I did nothing. Eight years ago I woke, and when I was strong enough I came here and that is all I know.""

""Then...Mother?""

""I don't know. I hope so. I am praying so,"" he added in a whisper.

""As will I,"" said Helena. ""There is so much I need to say to her."" She looked at him, and gave a small smile. ""And even more I have to tell you.""

Harry smiled at her. ""I would like that. I have missed you.""

""Me too."" For a moment she looked as if she was going to say something, but then she shook her head. ""But you have yet to introduce yourself. Who exactly are you now?""

Harry sighed, but she was going to have to know at some point. ""Harry Potter.""

Helena opened her mouth, then closed it again. Harry watched in growing amusement as she visibly struggled for words, then shook her head. ""Harry Potter?""

Harry nodded.

""The Boy Who Lived.""

Harry pulled a face. ""Please don't.""

""The one who vanquished the Dark lord.""

""Helena...""

Helena laughed then, a bright pure sound that Harry hadn't realised he had missed so much. ""Only you, Uncle. Only you.""

In the end, Harry could only laugh too.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Days turned into weeks as Harry's summer passed in a blissful haze. He had originally planned to spend some time exploring the new magical world, but being at Hogwarts, where he was welcomed and accepted without hesitation, was enough that he felt no need for anything else. He spent hours in the library, easily dodging Dumbledore and the other teachers as he caught up on the centuries he had missed. History, politics, magical developments, anything, he devoured as much as he could get his hands on. If nothing else, he was going to have to keep up with Rowena somehow.

Meeting Helena had only made things better. After the shock of their respective situations had sunk in, both had been delighted by the second chance they had been given. Helena proved invaluable in catching Harry up with some of the changes that occurred at Hogwarts, and her glee at having their situations reversed was a joy to see after so many years.

Of course, it wasn't all easy going. Despite Harry's urgings Helena flatly refused to talk about her death, or about why she had chosen to return as a spirit. Harry couldn't really blame her, his own death was something he'd rather not think about given the choice, but not knowing made him feel sick to his stomach. It didn't help that he knew she was keeping something else from him too, something important, but he knew his niece well enough to know how stubborn she was. He would get the answers eventually, but it would take some time.

So Harry stuck to safe topics.

""You are sure that they will return?""

Relatively safe topics at least.

""I am not certain,"" Harry admitted. ""But I did, and I made no provision to. There is a chance that the same may be true of them.""

Helena's transparent face clearly betrayed her scepticism, but Harry could also see his own desperate hope in her eyes. Her hands clenched on her pearly dress, and she shook her head. ""We will see,"" she said softly. She shook herself, and turned a small smile on him. ""I am glad you are back at least.""

Harry just about managed to smile back. As pleasant as it was to get a second chance at life, and to see Helena again, the thought of spending the next hundred years without his family was nigh on unbearable. Some might have told him to make new friends, but Harry was a man a thousand years out of time. How could he possibly go through life pretending to be a child, never letting anyone see him for who he truly was?

Salazar had tried that once, and it had not worked out well. Harry had no intention of making the same mistake twice.

Helena's next words drew Harry straight back to their earlier discussion.

""Maybe they will be one of the students arriving next week.""

Harry stared at her. ""Next week?""

Helena shot him a bemused look. ""You didn't realise?""

Harry could only shake his head. He had run away from his relatives shortly before the start of the summer holidays. It seemed incredible that so many weeks could have passed without him noticing.

Helena grinned. ""You'll like it here when the students are back, Uncle. Things have changed a bit.""

""I have noticed something of the sort,"" said Harry dryly. ""We will see.""

Maybe Helena was right. Maybe he would hear the news he had been waiting for.

Harry kept his eyes open after that, and soon understood Helena's amusement. House-elves and teachers alike were running around with such purpose that it was a mark of just how distracted he was that he hadn't noticed the signs sooner. He noted with resignation that Helena was never going to let him forget it.

Overall though, Harry was too interested in what was going on to worry about what his niece thought of him. Preparing for a new year, with a new group of students, had always been equal parts exciting and terrifying, and from the atmosphere everywhere he went nothing had changed much. Of course some teachers seemed more excited than others, watching Professors Flitwick and Snape interact the night before the students were due to arrive was the most entertainment Harry had had all summer.

It was also a very welcome distraction from Harry's own nerves. He had been trying to stay calm about the prospect of new students arriving, but it was one of the hardest things he had ever done. He knew better than to get his hopes up, but the idea that one or more of his friends might be arriving any day was intoxicating.

The day itself was even worse. The teachers had plenty to keep themselves busy, and the house-elves had even more to do, but Harry was too agitated even to read. Helena eventually got exasperated enough to send him down to the kitchens, where the house-elves graciously put him to work. He had never had much interest in cooking, unlike Helga, but it was enough like Potions that Salazar had always been able to manage and it was a better distraction than any he could think of.

Still, by the time Hagrid left to collect the students, Harry was a nervous wreck. He had hidden himself at the entrance of one of the secret passages in the Entrance Hall, and for once in his life was finding it almost impossible to sit still. He could feel Hogwarts' tolerant exasperation in the back of his mind, but to his relief the castle didn't try to make conversation. Soon a prickling at the edge of his awareness alerted him to the fact that Thestral-drawn carriages carrying the older students were entering the boundaries of the wards, and he shuffled closer to the edge of the tapestry. Harry knew that none of the older students were his friends, but he was still curious to see some of the people who had benefitted from their work.

Soon enough the students started making their way through the Entrance Hall to the Great Hall. Harry watched them fondly. They were different to the students he had taught. They were more open on the whole, more innocent, but they were just as excited to be back as the children he remembered.

He didn't recognise any of them. He hadn't expected to, and he wasn't even completely sure how he would, but it still hurt.

Harry slumped back against the passage wall, and tried to think. Helena had told him that first years were now brought round to the school via the lake. If that was true, then they should be reaching the first of the true wards very soon. If any of his friends were among them he would know soon enough.

Hopefully.

Harry hadn't prayed to anything for a long time. He did now.

And Hogwarts exploded into song.

'Welcome home!'

The storm of emotion sent Harry to his knees, but he didn't care. Someone else had returned. Someone else was home.

He wasn't alone.

""Who?"" he whispered. ""Who is it?""

Hogwarts laughed. 'You wouldn't want me to spoil the surprise, now would you?' Harry scowled, and he felt the warm brush of the castle's consciousness against his. 'It will only be a few minutes.'

Harry took a deep breath. He had waited this long. A little longer wouldn't hurt. He pushed himself up, wincing at the pain in his bruised knees, and hurried back to the edge of the passage. A quick glance out showed Professor McGonagall waiting to receive the new students, and Harry grimaced. Hopefully she would leave them alone for at least a few minutes. It would be impossible to speak with whoever had arrived before the Sorting otherwise.

'Calm, Salazar. All will be well.'

Harry rolled his eyes, but at that moment there was a booming knock on the door. Harry froze, mouth suddenly bone dry, and watched as the door swung open. About fifty children scuttled in, and Harry desperately scanned their faces for any sign of recognition. He skipped over those who were clearly awestruck, paused for a second on a pair of red-headed twins he just knew would be trouble-makers, then slid over to a dark-haired boy who looked up just in time to meet Harry's gaze.

If the fierce jolt of something settling place hadn't confirmed it, the brilliant smile that lit the boy's face was more than enough to settle all doubts.

'See?'

Harry barely heard her. McGonagall was shepherding the first years towards a small antechamber on the other side of the hall, but the boy had lagged until he was at the very back of the group. He shot a final wary look at the witch, then dashed across to the tunnel and let the tapestry fall to cover the entrance.

The next thing Harry knew, he was enveloped in a bone-crushing hug.

""Thank God its you I missed you so much I'm so so sorry-""

""Godric,"" Harry wheezed. ""Can't breathe.""

But he was hugging back just as tightly, and had no intention of letting go any time soon. After so many years, something was right again.

""I'm sorry,"" Godric whispered. ""I'm so, so sorry.""

Harry squeezed his eyes shut. ""Me too. I never meant to leave you.""

Somehow, Godric hugged him tighter. ""Leave? You died, Salazar."" He drew back, and looked Harry straight in the eye. ""I should have been there.""

""And we were both to blame,"" said Harry quietly. ""I shouldn't have lost my temper."" He forced the storm of emotions under control, and shook his head. ""We can't do this now. You need to get Sorted.""

Godric though, was too busy gaping at his forehead. ""Salazar,"" he said slowly. ""Please tell me that that isn't what I think it is.""

Harry winced. Godric stared at him, then took a step back and looked him over properly. ""And why are you here at all? You're still younger than me.""

Harry sighed, but there was no way Godric would leave without at least some of the truth. ""I was placed with my Muggle relatives after my parents died."" He looked down, unwilling to meet Godric's gaze. ""They don't like magic, so I left as soon as I could. I've been here all summer.""

Godric swallowed, and pulled Harry into another hug. This time he didn't say anything, but the silent love and comfort was exactly what Harry needed.

""Next summer, you'll come home with me,"" Godric whispered after a minute. ""My parents won't mind.""

Harry suspected Godric's parents might disagree about that, but the words still sent a warm glow through his chest. Only Godric could make a promise like that. He was the only person Salazar would accept it from.

'I hate to interrupt,' Hogwarts murmured. 'But your absence has been noted.'

Godric grunted, his face setting into the mulish expression Harry knew so well, but Harry shook his head. ""We can catch up later. Right now, you've already attracted too much attention.""

Godric sighed, but stepped away. ""It's fine, I'll say I got distracted. But I'll come and find you as soon as possible.""

Harry smiled at him. ""I can't wait.""

Godric ruffled his hair fondly, easily dodging Harry's half-hearted attempts to swat him away, then paused at the tunnel entrance and glanced back. ""Oh, and my name is Cedric now. Cedric Diggory.""

""Cedric,"" Harry repeated. ""At least it's easy to remember.""

Cedric rolled his eyes, and disappeared in the direction of the Great Hall. Harry slumped back against the wall, and finally let the tears fall. Godric was back. Everything would be all right.

Harry only stayed for a few minutes before his stomach reminded him rather loudly that he hadn't eaten all day. He Apparated down to the kitchens, where the house-elves had already set aside a plate for him, and sat down out of the way to eat and watch them finish their preparations. House-elf magic was always fascinating to watch, especially in such large numbers.

He was distracted though by a sudden flare of confusion, and looked up.

""What's wrong?""

'Nothing,' said Hogwarts, after a moment. 'Godric just got Sorted.' Harry waited, but Hogwarts still sounded slightly bemused when she finally continued, 'He's in Hufflepuff.'

Harry froze with a forkful of potato halfway to his mouth. ""He's what?""

Thanks for reading! Any feedback would be appreciated.

And before anyone asks, half of the Founders and half of their reincarnations with be in their canon houses, but not necessarily the same halves. Harry, for example, will be in Slytherin. They're all open-minded enough to try something different.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

If the wait for the students to arrive had been difficult, the one for them all to get to sleep was torturous. Harry spent the hours pacing the Room of Requirement, completely unable to sit still.

Godric was here. Well, Cedric was here, but it didn't matter. His brother was here, and the future was looking far, far brighter than it had for a very long time.

""What's keeping him?"" he muttered.

Amusement reverberated through his mind. 'He does have to wait for the rest of his house to go to bed. He'll be here soon enough.'

Harry sighed, and kept pacing. He'd already had to convince himself not to sneak into the Hufflepuff dormitories. The chances of him getting caught were slim to say the least, but it was still safer for Godric to come to him.

Ten minutes later, his patience was rewarded when the door swirled into place. Harry spun round just as Godric, no Cedric, Harry had to get used to the name, entered the room.

Harry folded his arms, and fixed his friend with a flat look. ""Hufflepuff?""

Cedric paused, then crossed the room in a few long strokes and pulled Harry into another hug. ""I missed you,"" he muttered.

""You said that already,"" Harry pointed out, but he hugged back just as hard.

""Well, it's true."" He drew back, and Harry was startled to see tears in his eyes. ""You died,"" he whispered. ""You died, and I wasn't there.""

Harry swallowed. He had been trying not to think about that, but now that Godric was here he couldn't avoid it. He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. ""It wasn't your fault, Cedric. And it wasn't mine either. It was just...how things turned out.""

""How things turned out?"" Cedric repeated. ""You were murdered! And the last thing I said to you-""

""Doesn't matter,"" Harry interrupted. ""Not any more."" Cedric opened his mouth, but he remained quiet when Harry gripped his shoulder. ""What happened in the past is done. We have a second chance now, and I don't want to waste time.""

Cedric bit his lip. He was silent for a minute, then let his shoulders slump. ""All right. Fine. But things will be different now. I swear on my life.""

Harry's own vision turned blurry, and he hurried to wipe his eyes. ""I know. We know better now.""

Cedric smiled, and this time Harry was the one to go to him for a hug. He couldn't help it. Only Dudley got hugs at Privett Drive, and ghosts weren't very good at physical contact. Cedric's grip turned crushing for a moment, then he stepped back with clear reluctance.

""I still can't believe you're Harry Potter. Though I really shouldn't be surprised.""

""Helena said the same thing,"" said Harry dryly.

Cedric nodded, his smile fading. ""Helena...I saw her at the feast. How...?""

Harry grimaced. ""She won't tell me. She knows who I am though. We'll get it out of her.""

""Preferably before Rowena arrives,"" said Cedric grimly.

Harry felt his heart skip a beat. ""You think she will? They will?""

Cedric squeezed his shoulders. ""I don't see why not. It's not like we planned to, after all, and yet here we are.""

Harry recognised the longing in his voice and swallowed. As wonderful as it was to have Godric back, things wouldn't be right until their friends joined them. ""I hope so,"" he whispered.

They stood in silence for a minute, then Harry shook his head. ""You distracted me. Hufflepuff?""

Cedric grinned, but his grey eyes remained serious. ""I have reasons.""

""Good ones?""

""When are my reasons not good ones?"" He laughed at the expression on Harry's face, and threw himself into one of the armchairs. Once Harry followed suit, he continued, ""Well, firstly, my parents are Hufflepuffs, and they will be over the moon.""

Harry raised an eyebrow but didn't comment, and after a moment Cedric's smile faded. ""But mainly because it isn't fair.""

Harry frowned at him. ""What do you mean?""

Cedric sighed. ""I know you grew up with Muggles, but you must have been catching up on everything since you got here. You've seen what people think of Hufflepuff.""

Harry's hands clenched into fists. ""I've been getting an idea.""

It had enraged him just as much as his own house's tarnished reputation had. How the virtues of loyalty, hard work, and open-mindedness could possibly been seen as anything to be ashamed of were beyond him. Cedric's grey eyes were cold as ice.

""Everyone calls Hufflepuff the house for those who weren't good enough to go anywhere else,"" he said quietly. ""We'll see if they say the same once I'm done.""

Harry managed a faint smile at that. ""Helga will appreciate it.""

""She deserves no less. This should never have happened at all."" He paused, and looked Harry straight in the eye. ""And Hufflepuff is not the only one.""

Harry didn't trust himself to reply, and so just nodded. Cedric leaned forward to grip his shoulder. ""You will prove them otherwise,"" he said fiercely. ""This is not your fault, Salazar.""

Harry snorted. ""No. Just my name and ideals that have been twisted beyond recognition."" Magic cracked in the air, and he took a moment to control himself. ""I don't know why we came back,"" he said. ""But we will make the most of it.""

Cedric gave a grim smile. ""Hogwarts will be united again. I expect Rowena will return to Ravenclaw, and Helga will be happy wherever she decides. Whatever happens, between the four of us we can set things right.""

Harry said nothing, but he let himself slump back against the soft cushions. Even with the enormity of the task facing them, just having some sort of plan, and someone to talk it over with was a relief. ""It'll be strange with half of us in different houses, but it'll be a good change of perspective,"" he said. He let out a deep breath, and closed his eyes. ""We will be fine.""

Cedric hummed in agreement, and for a minute, they sat in silence. Eventually though, Cedric sighed and sat up.

""So, are you going to tell me what happened with you?""

Harry stiffened, but Cedric's eyes held nothing but compassion, and he took a moment to gather himself. Cedric deserved to know, and Harry needed to tell someone.

""I don't remember everything,"" he said quietly. ""I remember my father telling my mother to flee with me. I remember her pleading for Voldemort to kill her instead. Then there was just green light.""

Cedric drew in a sharp breath. ""So it was the Killing Curse? How is that possible?""

Harry traced the pattern on the cushion, and shook his head. ""I don't know. I suspect my mother did something, there were Blood Wards around the Dursleys' residence that were connected to me, but I never got the chance to examine them properly."" His mouth twisted into a smile. ""And now they are redundant, to say the least.""

Cedric's jaw clenched, and Harry saw his hand move towards his wand. ""Warding was never my strong point,"" he began, and his tone would have sent Dark lords running for cover, ""but would I be correct in thinking that those ward rely on feelings of love and acceptance to attain their full potency?""

Harry made a mental note to never give his friend the Dursleys' address, and pushed himself to his feet. For some reason, he found it easier to think on the move this time round. ""They were not as bad as they could have been. They did not want me there, and they made no attempts to pretend otherwise, but they were more neglectful than outright abusive.""

""That's bad enough,"" Cedric snarled. ""They are your family.""

Harry gave him a small smile. ""Cedric, I'm fine,"" he said gently. ""Compared to the last time..."" He trailed off with a shrug.

Cedric held his gaze for a long moment, then his shoulders slumped. ""It is good to see you without the staff.""

Harry closed his eyes. ""I can run. I can climb. I might even try one of those brooms everyone likes so much."" He shook himself, and looked at Cedric. ""I'm never going back there. That's all I care about.""

Cedric still looked like he wanted to curse the Dursleys into oblivion, but he contented himself with a shake of his head. ""It's your call.""

""Thank you."" He dropped back into his chair and slumped against the cushions. ""So what's your family like this time?""

""Well, I'm a pureblood,"" Cedric began. ""My parents were both in Hufflepuff, as I said. My dad works for the Ministry of Magic, and Mum is studying for her Potions Mastery.""

Harry brightened. ""Really?""

Cedric shot him an amused look. ""Yes, I'm sure she would be happy to catch you up.""

Harry ran a sheepish hand through his hair. He would have to find a way to get some brewing done over the year. Cedric's expression made it quite clear he knew what his friend was thinking as he continued, ""A couple of magical families live nearby. Mr. Lovegood has a daughter who's a year younger than you, but the Weasleys have seven children, four of whom are at Hogwarts now."" He paused. ""I think that's right. Yeah, Bill's left."" He grinned. ""The twins started this year. I expect they'll make life interesting.""

Harry's eyes narrowed. ""Are they red-heads?""

Cedric laughed. ""That's them. I think Mr. and Mrs Weasley were pleased to be rid of them for most of the year. At least they're all in Gryffindor, so Charlie and Percy can keep them under control.""

Harry nodded, but his stomach twisted uncomfortably. He was glad Cedric had had a good life so far, but part of him couldn't help but wonder about his new friends. He knew that Cedric needed friends his own age. He couldn't afford to be isolated, and the more contacts they could make around their fellow students, the better.

Jealousy was not an attractive trait, Harry reminded himself firmly. Cedric certainly didn't deserve it.

""That reminds me,"" said Cedric suddenly. ""We need to go to Diagon Alley at some point.""

Harry blinked. ""Excuse me?""

Cedric's grin was all too familiar. ""Well, we'll have to go to Hogsmeade too, but there's a lot more choice in Diagon Alley."" He frowned suddenly. ""It's a shame they won't sell you a wand until you get your Hogwarts letter.""

""I do have one that works with me,"" said Harry absently, but his mind was whirling. ""Anyway, I have no money.""

Cedric's smile faded. ""Harry, your parents were rich,"" he said. ""At least, your father's family was. Even without a key, a blood test from the goblins will allow you access to your vault.""

Harry had known the Dursleys were lying about his parents and their wastrel status. Somehow, the confirmation still hurt. His hands were shaking, and he clenched them into fists. ""Yes. I'll do that.""

Cedric nodded. ""I'll take you. I should be all right with Side-Along Apparation, especially now that I've got a wand. Though I do need to get a secondary one.""

They had all learned the value of having a back-up wand. Harry managed a faint smile. ""I think Hogwarts can help with that.""

Right on cue, the array of wands that Harry had tested at the start of summer appeared on a table in front of them. Cedric beamed. ""I am so glad to be back. Thank you, Hogwarts.""

They both received a brief caress in acknowledgement, and Cedric began testing the wands. ""This is very useful, but also quite worrying.""

""That was my reaction,"" Harry admitted. ""What's your official wand?""

""Aspen, twelve and a half inches, with a dragon heartstring core,"" Cedric rattled off. He touched another wand, shook his head, and moved on to the next one. ""Good for Duelling and Charms work, so I can't imagine why it chose me."" Harry snorted, and Cedric grinned at him. ""You'll be pleased to know that the Ollivander family is still in business.""

""That is good news,"" Harry agreed. The family had been fine wandmakers in their time, and no doubt their skills had only increased over the intervening centuries.

Cedric eventually managed to get a satisfactory response from a laurel wand, and he was smiling as he banished the remaining wands.

""I'm almost hoping someone does try to steal it.""

""Why does it not surprise me that that that is the only piece of wandlore you ever managed to remember?"" asked Harry dryly.

Cedric pulled a face at him, but he couldn't keep the satisfied smile from his face as he ran through a series of basic spell chains with his new wand. He nodded approvingly at the results, but then his expression suddenly turned serious. ""Harry, have you thought about what you're going to do for the next two years?""

""Of course I have,"" said Harry with a huff. ""What do you take me for?""

Cedric rolled his eyes. ""You know what I mean.""

Harry relented, and shrugged. ""I'll read. I've got a lot of catching up to do. And I want to keep an eye on some of the teachers. I won't have our students receiving substandard teaching.""

""No arguments here,"" said Cedric grimly. ""Overall, Hogwarts has retained its good reputation, but I've heard some things from the Weasleys that concern me.""

Harry set his jaw. That would not do. ""We'll see what we can do.""

They might be only nine and eleven respectively, but they were also Founders of Hogwarts. Woe betide any who underestimated them within the walls of their home.

The moment was broken when Harry let out a jaw-cracking yawn. Cedric grinned, but a moment later, found himself yawning even louder.

""I'd forgotten how tiring being eleven was,"" he grumbled. ""And I've got classes tomorrow.""

""Yes, however will you cope?""

Cedric flicked a minor jinx at him, which Harry deflected with a wave of his hand. ""Says the one who will get to stay in bed."" He grinned suddenly. ""Though we really should start up our morning sparring sessions again.""

""I've been looking forward to it,"" said Harry, and he actually meant it. It had been a constant of their lives for nearly fifty years, and he had missed it more than he could say. Then his mood darkened, and he sighed. ""And we are going to need it.""

Cedric said nothing, but Harry sensed rather than saw every muscle tense. He sighed again. ""We need to find out what happened to Voldemort.""

Cedric's eyes narrowed. ""You don't think he was destroyed.""

""Dark Lords aren't destroyed easily,"" said Harry quietly. ""We both know that. And by sacrifice born of a mother's love?""

""It does leave some unanswered questions,"" Cedric agreed. He cocked his head to one side, sharp eyes never leaving Harry's. ""You know Dumbledore would probably be able to tell you something.""

""He's more likely to send me back to the Muggles than tell me anything,"" Harry snapped. ""I'm nine, remember? No-one will tell me anything.""

He couldn't wait to grow up. Cedric nodded ruefully. ""It can be frustrating. My parents think I'm mature for my age, but they only take it so far."" He shook his head. ""Not that I can blame them. They'd think me insane.""

Harry sighed, already regretting his outburst. ""We could prove it, but...""

""It would cause more problems, especially for you,"" said Cedric immediately. ""We'll have to wait to establish ourselves before we think about anything else."" He sighed, and tilted his head back to stare at the ceiling. ""I hope the girls get here soon.""

Harry's chest ached, and he had to look away. ""At least we know they're all right, if they are here,"" he said quietly. ""They haven't felt the need to run away."" That was just him. Again.

Harry shook his head firmly. Self-pity was pointless. He stood up, and nudged Cedric with his toe. ""You should head back. Classes start in the morning.""

Cedric pulled a face. ""First year classes,"" he grumbled, as he dragged himself up. ""We're going to have to find something more interesting to do over the year.""

Harry smirked at him. ""I'm sure we can come up with something.""

Cedric grinned. ""Oh, I think so."" He turned towards the door, and then paused. ""It's good to see you again, Salazar,"" he said softly. ""We missed you.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. Cedric hesitated, then darted back back to pull him into a tight hug. ""Don't you dare get yourself killed again,"" he whispered into Harry's hair. ""I...we can't go through that. Not again.""

""I'll do my best,"" Harry said. Cedric's arms tightened, and Harry closed his eyes.

That was the only promise he could make.

Thanks for reading! Any feedback would be appreciated.

One of the nice things about the students being back, Harry reflected, was not having to Disillusion himself as he made his way through his castle. In his plain back robes and with his scar covered, he looked just like any other first year, albeit one that was a bit smaller than usual. The portraits took no notice of him, and the other students accepted him as one of them without question. He did have to be more careful with the teachers, but they were easy enough to avoid. He still had to Disillusion himself once he got to the library, or run the risk of getting drawn into conversation, but that was good practice.

It was in the library that Cedric found him after their first day of lessons. Harry had hidden himself among the advanced Runes books right at the back, and was happily catching up on everything he'd missed when his friend dropped his bag next to him.

""Binns has to go.""

Harry bade a silent farewell to Leonardo da Vinci, and set the book aside in favour of peering at his friend. ""Which one is that?""

""History of Magic,"" said Cedric shortly. ""It was the worst lesson I've ever had in my life.""

Harry frowned. History was too important a subject to be neglected. The Muggle-borns in particular needed to understand the world they had become a part of, but it was equally important for those raised in the magical world to get a proper, unbiased education.

""In what way?"" he asked. ""Was he a bad teacher, or...?""

""He spent an hour droning on and on about the goblin rebellions! He didn't introduce himself, he didn't lay out a proper lesson plan, he just started talking and didn't stop! I knew some of what he was talking about from my grandmother, but everyone else in there was completely lost. If I was a Muggle-born and that was my first exposure to magic I'd leave and never come back!""

""Calm down,"" Harry hissed. They were well away from curious ears, but Cedric's shouting wouldn't go unnoticed. Cedric lowered his voice, but he was still fuming.

""And he even manages to make goblin rebellions boring. I tell you, Harry, half the class was asleep within twenty minutes. He's the least inspiring person I've ever met! I'm amazed anyone passes any exam in that class, let alone their OWLs and NEWTs.""

Harry blinked, thrown by the sudden detour to animals. ""Excuse me?""

Cedric opened his mouth, then paused and shook his head. ""Sorry, keep forgetting you didn't grow up with this stuff. Students take OWL exams in fifth year, and more advanced NEWTs in seventh year."" Harry nodded in understanding, and Cedric returned to his diatribe, ""But hardly anyone takes History to NEWT level, and Binns' lessons are considered a chance to catch up on sleep. It cannot continue.""

Harry shook his head. ""I agree. We'll think of something."" He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""Any chance he could be persuaded to resign?""

Cedric gave him a peculiar look. ""If no-one has been able to manage it in the last two hundred years, I doubt we'll have much luck.""

Harry nodded, then blinked and stared at him. ""What?""

He had to have misheard. Cedric stared at him in complete confusion for a moment, then his expression cleared and he laughed. ""Oh, Harry.""

""What?"" Harry demanded. He raised his wand. ""I have enough control over my magic to hex you, you know.""

Cedric controlled himself, and shook his head. ""Sorry, I needed that. Harry, Binns is a ghost.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. ""Having a ghost teach History is actually quite a good idea.""

""Of course you would say that,"" said Cedric fondly, but his expression soon turned serious. ""The problem is, Binns refuses to accept that he is a ghost. As a result, he refuses to adapt to his circumstances in any way, including updating his curriculum. From what I can tell, he doesn't cover anything more recent than the mid-nineteenth century, not even the times of Grindelwald or Voldemort."" He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. ""And he really is a dreadful teacher.""

Harry tapped his wand thoughtfully against his knee. ""I wonder why Dumbledore hasn't asked him to move on. He must realise that our students' education is more important than being able to claim a ghost as a professor.""

""It's probably more a case of misplaced loyalty than any sense of prestige,"" Cedric suggested. ""But you're right. Things can't continue.""

There was a logical solution, and Harry didn't hesitate to suggest it. ""I'll have a talk with him. I will try to talk him into moving on first,"" he added quickly, when Cedric raised an eyebrow. ""I'll save those...other measures for later.""

""Like Peeves,"" Cedric muttered. ""I still can't believe no-one's gotten rid of him yet.""

Harry pulled a face. As amusing as they had found the poltergeist at first, he was absolutely impossible to control. At least he was as protective of the castle and students as they were, in his own unique way. Harry shook his head and returned to the matter at hand.

""When should we do it?""

Cedric pursed his lips thoughtfully. ""This weekend.""

""Thank you, that gives me so much time to prepare.""

Cedric nudged him with the toe of his boot. ""It also gives our students time to get a decent teacher this year. Besides, since when have you struggled to exorcise a ghost?""

""It's the principle of the thing,"" said Harry, with a sniff. ""Will you be helping?""

Cedric nodded. ""I'll find someone to cover for me. I doubt they'll suspect a first year anyway, but there's no point taking risks.""

Harry smirked at him. ""So you were listening all those years. I was beginning to wonder.""

Cedric shot a light hex at him, that Harry deflected with flick of his wand. It hit the nearest bookshelf, and they winced as one.

""Maybe we should stick to sparring in the Room of Requirement,"" said Cedric sheepishly. ""Rowena will murder us otherwise.""

Harry snorted in agreement, and cast a quick Cleaning Charm at the shelf. ""We'll add it to the list of things not to tell her."" He glanced round to check they hadn't attracted any unwanted attention, before returning to the topic of discussion. ""So Binns needs to go. Any other areas of concern?""

Cedric twirled his wand absently as he thought about it. ""I've had Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall today, and they were all excellent. Astronomy isn't until Wednesday night, but I haven't heard any complaints about Sinistra."" He paused, and looked at Harry. ""The upper years did warn us all that Snape is incredibly biased towards Slytherin.""

Harry had to force his fingers to relax on his wand. ""I have observed him in passing,"" he said quietly. ""There is a darkness in him that I do not like."" He was silent for a moment, then sighed. ""I will try to observe his classes, and see how he interacts with each of the houses."" Some favouritism was understandable, but none of the other heads of house had the reputation that Snape did.

Cedric's lips thinned. ""Be careful. He isn't one to cross."" Harry nodded, and after a moment Cedric continued, ""I will try to talk to the older students about the elective teachers, when it won't be too suspicious, but I did hear a couple of people talking about taking Divination just because it was an easy OWL.""

Harry rolled his eyes. ""Students. I don't know why Divination was ever added to the course list, it's completely pointless for anyone other than a true Seer."" He shook his head. ""We might have to leave that for Rowena to deal with.""

""Neither of us would have any idea about assessing a teacher's competence in that area,"" Cedric agreed. He grinned suddenly. ""And I wouldn't want to deprive Ro of the satisfaction.""

Harry snorted. Their friend had always been rather eloquent on the subject of charlatans. Cedric's grin widened at the memory, but after a moment he shook his head. ""All right. That should be enough to keep us going for a little while."" He shot Harry an appraising look. ""Will you be up for sparring this evening?""

""If you think you can get away without being noticed,"" said Harry, with a nod. ""I know Helga's lot were always the most protective of new students.""

""Trust me, nothing has changed at all,"" said Cedric fondly. He slipped his wand back into its holster, and stood up. ""I should get back though. They'll be wondering where I got to.""

Harry didn't like having to catch odd moments with his best friend, but that couldn't be helped. He started to reach for another book, but suddenly paused. Something in Cedric's expression told him that there was something else. He raised an eyebrow, and after a moment of silent consideration, Cedric surrendered.

""Harry, Helena isn't the only one here.""

This time, Harry did Disillusion himself as he made his way through the corridors. It wasn't quite as effective as normal though. Try as he might, he couldn't keep his emotions, or his still-developing magic under control. He avoid the students as best he could, but he still saw the more sensitive among them start and shiver as he passed.

Under normal circumstances he would be appalled by his lack of control, but for the moment he simply didn't care. As far as he was concerned, the cause was sufficient.

Cedric hadn't tried to dissuade him from his course of action. In all likelihood his friend would have joined him, but this confrontation was better held while the students were at dinner in the Great Hall, and Cedric's absence would be noticed. Hufflepuffs were protective of their first years.

Besides, this conversation would go better with just the two of them.

A flicker from up ahead warned of Professors Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry paused just long enough to confirm with Hogwarts that his target hadn't left the dungeons before ducking into a secret passage. The students might notice his magic if they were paying particular attention, but a teacher certainly would. The slightly longer route was acceptable, if only because it gave Harry a chance to process the information.

It was no wonder Helena had been so reluctant to talk to him.

The dungeons were deserted by the time Harry got there. All the Slytherins were in the Great Hall, and Harry took a moment to catch his breath before heading into the labyrinth of passages. The familiar surroundings soothed him, and his fury cooled to something quieter, but no less dangerous. He was Slytherin, and would deal with this as he ought.

The Bloody Baron was exactly where Hogwarts had told Harry he would be. He recognised the little alcove immediately, and nostalgia threatened to overwhelm him. He cancelled the Disillusionment Charm with a thought, sat on the stone bench, and looked at the spirit of the man who had been one of his first students.

""I did not expect to see you again, Edmund.""

Edmund gave no sign of having heard, but after a long moment he turned blank silver eyes to Harry. ""Likewise. Sir.""

That answered the question of whether Helena had spoken to him. Harry nodded, but kept his own face expressionless. ""Tell me.""

His expression was one thing, his magic quite another. Edmund flinched, and looked away. ""I refused to listen. I ignored everything you taught me. I was a fool.""

""Foolish was continuing to pursue Helena, despite our objections,"" said Harry coldly. ""What you did-""

""Was unforgivable,"" the ghost interrupted. ""I know, sir."" He looked back, and this time the pain was clearly visible in his black eyes. ""I was blind with rage. I regretted it the moment it was done, and I knew there was no way to atone for it."" He stared round at the alcove where Salazar had set with him, and where he had set with younger Slytherins in turn. ""I returned in penance, and here I will remain a long as Hogwarts endures.""

Harry nodded slowly. ""And Helena?""

Edmund's face twisted in ancient grief. ""She returned for the same reason, but it was too late. Her mother..."" His voice faltered, and he looked down for a moment before continuing, ""She needs forgiveness, but she cannot move on. She is afraid.""

Harry closed his eyes. He had half-expected as much. He shook his head, and looked back at Edmund. ""And now?""

If ghosts could pale, Harry had no doubt that Edmund would have, but he met Harry's gaze without flinching. ""She will wait for her mother. She has much to say to her. As do I.""

He fell silent, but there was a tension to him that told Harry that he had more yet to say. Harry waited, and finally the ghost spoke again, ""And I failed you.""

""You did,"" said Harry. He tried to keep his voice level, but his magic crackled in the air. ""I trusted you to protect her.""

Edmund flinched, and looked away. ""Everything changed after...after your death,"" he whispered. Harry's stomach twisted painfully, but the Baron wasn't finished, ""They all changed. The students didn't know what to do."" His mouth twisted into a bitter smile. ""Neither did I."" His shoulders slumped, and he bowed his head. ""We missed you.""

Harry didn't reply. He couldn't. Even after years of being with his friends, and being known and respected as one of the founders of Hogwarts, he had ever quite been able to abandon the fear of being forgotten. He had dreaded the thought of his death passing unnoticed. Years with the Dursleys had only reinforced those feelings.

He really should have known better. Hogwarts was a steady presence in the back of his mind, and he thought of Cedric's rib-cracking hugs, and managed to clear his throat.

""Likewise.""

Edmund relaxed a tiny fraction, and Harry knew he understood. He took a moment to collect himself, then coughed. ""What is your role within Slytherin House?""

The Baron paused, but more in thought than out of a reluctance to answer. ""I try to guide them, as you guided us. I support them when faced with the other students."" He paused, and then there was reluctance. ""But...things are not easy for Slytherins. And not all of it is undeserved.""

The thought sent a familiar pulse of anger through Harry, and he checked himself when Edmund twitched. ""I am aware. And when I am old enough, I will set things right.""

Edmund said nothing, but he bowed with every ounce of his old respect, and Harry let himself relax a little. He could not change the past, and he did not know if he could forgive. All he could do was help the people he loved as best he could.

""Rowena will come,"" he said quietly. ""You will wait for her, and you will accept whatever judgement she proclaims.""

Edmund just bowed again. Harry sighed. He didn't envy his friend at all. He shook his head firmly; Rowena needed the truth, and they all needed some form of closure. In any case, Rowena wasn't here yet. They would deal with this mess when the time came.

In the meantime, there was another ghostly problem to deal with.

""Stupefy!""

Harry grinned a vicious grin and launched himself to one side. The red light missed him by inches, and a rapid Shield Charm caught the two the first one had been herding him towards. He retaliated with a furry of curses, but his opponent countered with a shield of his own and started to advance, pressing his offensive all the way. Harry backed up, still casting as fast as he could manage, but the strain on his young magic was becoming difficult to bear. A ridiculously overpowered Disarming Spell sent his wand spinning from his hand, and him crashing to the floor.

""Ow.""

Cedric's face swam into view, his expression decidedly sheepish. ""That might have been a bit much.""

Harry glared at him. ""You think?"" 

His lungs were still burning, and his muscles felt like jelly as he accepted his friend's help up. He leaned forward, hands resting on his knees as he tried to catch his breath. He had forgotten just how intense these workouts could get.

Though at least Cedric was breathing heavily too. At the beginning of the week Cedric had been defeating him with embarrassing ease, but sparring twice a day and training while Cedric was in lessons had paid off. Harry still had a lot of work to do, but his magic was rapidly getting used to combat again.

""That was longer than last time,"" Cedric said. ""You'll be back to your normal standards in no time.""

Harry gave him a tired smile. ""How did you manage to stay in shape?""

Cedric shrugged. ""As much physical training and wandless exercises as I could get away with.""

Harry grunted. Regularly missing meals and sleeping in a cupboard weren't conducive to building up decent muscle tone. From the way Cedric's expression had darkened the same thought was on his mind, but he knew better than to bring it up. Instead, his friend gave him a slightly forced smile.

""Though you're going to be faster than ever, I think.""

Harry just nodded. Dodging Dudley had been easier than trying to defend himself. Besides, just being able to run was enough of a novelty that he had indulged himself whenever possible. He still went out for a run round the grounds while the students were in their lessons. He couldn't spend all day reading, and the exercise would be invaluable for when he did get into a real fight.

Cedric still looked faintly murderous though, so Harry dragged himself back to the present.

""I hope so."" He stretched his aching muscles, and looked at his friend. ""So. Binns?""

Cedric paused, but moved on from plotting revenge on the Dursleys with a visible effort and a slightly sheepish look. ""Right. Everyone in Hufflepuff thinks I'm with the twins, and I told Fred and George that someone had told me something about the kitchens being near the Hufflepuff Basement, so that should keep them out of the way."" He glanced at his watch, and frowned. ""For an hour or two, at least.""

Harry raised an eyebrow at him. ""You're really going to subject the house-elves to those two?""

Cedric rolled his eyes. ""They aren't that bad.""

Harry hummed non-committedly. The twins had been at Hogwarts barely a week, and they had already caused more chaos than everyone else in the castle put together, save Peeves of course.

""They aren't!""

""If you say so,"" said Harry dryly. He retrieved his wand, and winced at the headache that had built up. He was using a lot of magic for someone of his age, but Harry knew his own capabilities. More importantly, he couldn't afford to wait.

""Harry?""

Harry shook his head. ""Just a headache."" His scar seemed to tingle and he rubbed at it rather irritably. ""And my scar seems to react to magic.""

Cedric frowned. ""You've never mentioned it before.""

""It doesn't happen often,"" said Harry. ""I think it's because the Room is so saturated with magic."" Hogwarts itself was one of the most magical places in the world, and the Room of Requirement had been the focus of some of their most delicate and complex spells.

Cedric's expression though, had darkened.

""Or your scar is reacting to something else.""

Harry paused. He hadn't considered that. The perfectly controlled room suddenly felt very cold. ""Cursed scars often react to the presence of Dark magic.""

The two of them looked at each other, then glanced around as one.

""Hogwarts,"" said Cedric evenly. ""What else have students been leaving in this room?""

There was an uncomfortably long pause before Hogwarts replied. 'I do not know.'

Cedric paled, and Harry had to take a steadying breath. They should have realised as much. Hogwarts was powerful, but she wasn't omniscient. ""Can you show us?""

This time there was no reply, but the room shivered and rippled and reformed. Harry stared around, and swallowed. ""Well, I know what I'll be doing for the next couple of years.""

Piles of rubbish lay heaped in rough rows as far as the eye could see. Some of it looked vaguely useful, like old books and robes, but there was also broken furniture, and scraps of parchment, and a multitude of magical items that Harry couldn't even begin to name. Cedric stared at the mess and shook his head.

""Wow,"" he breathed. ""Yeah. This ought to keep you busy.""

Harry pulled a face, but he couldn't bring himself to mind too much. There was only so much training he could do, particularly with Cedric in lessons, and even he couldn't just spend two years reading. Clearing up the Room of Requirement would be a suitable distraction.

Being able to locate and isolate anything that might be a potential danger to their students was just an added bonus.

'I would appreciate it,' said Hogwarts. 'No-one has done a proper clean out in centuries. The house-elves do not like to come here.'

Harry nodded. ""I wouldn't ask them to. If there are Dark items in here then I don't want them exposed to them."" In the distance a one of the stacks slowly toppled sideways and scattered on the floor with a crash, and he sighed. ""Rowena will have a fit."" The Room had been her pride and joy.

Cedric clapped him on the shoulder. ""You'd better work hard then. Of course, I would be more than willing to help out, if not for those pesky lessons...""

Harry rolled his eyes. ""I'm telling Ro you said that."" He took another long look at the chaos, then shook his head. ""We can deal with this later. We need to get moving.""

Cedric nodded, expression immediately turning serious. ""Where is Binns?""

There was a slight pause before Hogwarts replied. 'In his office. But you will be good to him, won't you? He has served well and faithfully for many years.""

Harry was inclined to dispute the serving well part, but he couldn't deny Binns' loyalty, and nodded. ""Of course.""

The two of them left the Room of Requirement and made their way down to Binns' office. They passed a few students, but neither of them paid the first year and apparent first year any attention. Harry used the trip to review the spells he would need if the ghost proved particularly stubborn, but he didn't miss the fact that Cedric's usually cheerful face was very grim. His friend caught his eye and grimaced.

""I'm not looking forward to this.""

Harry raised an eyebrow, and he flushed slightly. ""And no, it's not because he's a ghost. Honestly, Sal, I got over that before we returned to Britain.""

""I know,"" Harry drawled. ""But sometimes I need to remind myself that there really were things you were scared of."" Cedric rolled his eyes, and Harry smiled slightly before returning to the subject at hand. ""I don't particularly like it either, but we must. Our students deserve better.""

""I know,"" said Cedric, with a sigh. ""But still..."" He trailed off, and shook his head. ""Let's just get this over with.""

Harry eyed him for a moment, but he had always known when Godric didn't want to talk, and Cedric was even easier to read, so he kept his peace. He would have plenty of time to deal with whatever was bothering his closest friend once they were done.

Besides, he wanted to get this over with too.

Fortunately, Binns was in his office. It took him several minutes to realise that they were at the door, and even once he called them in he bore an expression of complete confusion. Harry supposed he wasn't a teacher who often received visitors outside of class.

""Yes, Diggly?""

""Diggory, sir,"" Cedric corrected gently.

""Of course, Diggersby."" Pale eyes turned to Harry, and narrowed. ""And you, I do not know.""

""Potter, sir,"" said Harry. Cedric shot him a sharp look, but Harry gave a slight shrug. One way or another, Binns would not be spreading that information. Binns though, just gave a slow blink.

""Porter, yes. I have taught many Porters.""

Or being mistaken for one of his ancestors also worked well enough. It also reinforced the impressions that Harry had got from Cedric and Hogwarts. Binns could not remain as a member of staff. Cedric coughed, and took a step forward.

""You have been here for a long time, Professor Binns.""

Binns started slightly in midair, as though he had forgotten that they were they. ""I suppose so, Digbeth.""

Cedric grimaced, but something about the ghost's manner caught Harry's attention, and he moved up to stand next to Cedric. ""You do not sound particularly excited about it.""

Binns shrugged. ""I am a teacher. Hogwarts is my life. Where else would I go?""

""Hogwarts was your life,"" said Harry gently. ""And I am sorry, Professor, but that life is over.""

Binns was completely still, but his head turned and for the first time he looked Harry straight in the eye. ""Over?""

Harry nodded. ""Is this really what you wish to spend eternity doing? Talking about the same old wars and rebellions to an ever-changing sea of faces? Never seeing what lies behind these walls, on the greatest adventure one can take?"" He stepped forward, ignoring the tension radiating from Cedric. ""You deserve better than this, Professor.""

Binns shook his head. ""No. No...I...This is what I chose.""

Cedric made a muffled noise, but Harry caught a flash of something behind the words, and his eyes narrowed. ""And have you since come to regret that choice?""

Binns held his gaze, and something resembling passion finally entered his expression. ""The choice was made.""

""And were you ever offered another?"" Harry asked. ""Or the choice to end this half existence?""

Binns did not reply, and Harry nodded. He had wondered as much. Wizards were not very good at change, especially when it came to time honoured traditions. Cedric looked between the two of them, mouth slightly open, before he finally turned back to Binns.

""If you did have the choice,"" he said gently, ""what would you like to do?""

For several long minutes, there was no reply. Harry was in no hurry. This was one of those decisions that should not, and would not be taken lightly. He had said his piece. He could only hope that it would be enough.

Binns stared at him for a long minute, then raised his head. He peered round at the stone walls as if seeing them for the first time, and his mouth twisted into a faint smile.

""I used to be able to remember the name of every student I ever taught. Their houses, their hopes, and dreams. Many visited me after leaving Hogwarts."" He paused, and his eyes came to rest on the two boys. ""What are your names?""

There was an edge to his voice that had not been there previously, and Harry bowed. ""My name is Harry Potter, and this is Cedric Diggory.""

Cedric smiled. ""It is a pleasure, sir.""

Misty eyes peered at them, and Binns slowly shook his head. ""I wish I could say the same,"" he murmured.

Cedric frowned, but kept quiet when Harry elbowed him. Harry himself met the ghost's eyes steadily. ""Is this the existence you want, Professor?""

""I never wanted this,"" said Binns quietly.

Harry tightened his grip on the wand in his pocket. It would not be long now. Cedric glanced at him, his face a mask of compassion, but made no move to interfere. Binns took a long, final look round, and drifted down to face Harry directly.

""End this, Harry Potter. Let me rest.""

Harry drew his wand, and bowed. ""Thank you for all that you have done for Hogwarts, Professor Binns,"" he said. ""You have served well.""

He couldn't help but let some of his old authority enter his voice. Binns' eyes widened, and even more so when Harry started to gather his magic. He glanced at Cedric, and then back at Harry, and his wrinkled face creased into a faint smile. 

""It appears I will miss a very interesting few years,"" he murmured. ""But then, I will have adventures of my own."" He bowed back. ""Farewell, Harry Potter.""

Harry took a deep breath, and began the incantation. A deep blue light began to emanate from the tip of his wand, faint at first, but growing steadily brighter. He concentrated on the rush of magic, and only looked up when the spell reached its climax.

There was a smile on Binns' face as he looked back, and then he was gone. 

The light faded, and Harry slowly lowered his wand. For a moment he stood there, then shook himself and glanced at Cedric.

""We should go,"" he said quietly. ""We don't want people to notice your absence.""

Cedric stared at him for a long second, then shook his head. He left the room without another word. Harry took a final glance at the spot where Binns had disappeared before following.

Cedric was very subdued as they made their way back through the corridors. Harry didn't feel much like talking himself, and it wasn't until they were back in the Room of Requirement that Cedric finally looked at him.

""He was so different,"" he said quietly. ""From Helena, and the Friar, and..."" He trailed off, with a grimace.

Harry sighed. ""He had lost his purpose. Helena and Edmund cannot find peace, and so cannot rest, and the other ghosts are much more involved with their students. For now, they are content.""

It was not an existence he would ever choose for himself, the very idea was unbearable, but he had seen how the ghosts of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff still took pleasure from their existence. Cedric still looked pale though, and Harry nudged him.

""Binns chose to move on.""

Cedric snorted. ""After you gave him so much choice in the matter."" Harry drew back, but Cedric was already shaking his head. ""I'm sorry. You remain as persuasive as ever.""

Harry eyed him for a moment, before deciding to let it go. His friend had always taken a different approach to himself. It was one of the reasons they worked so well together. Instead he leaned back in his chair.

""You can stop going easy on me when we spar tomorrow.""

Cedric blinked, then finally a faint smile touched his face. ""If you insist.""

He met Harry's eyes briefly in silent acknowledgement, then sighed and pushed himself up. ""I should go and rescue the house-elves. Two hours of dealing with the Weasley Twins is enough to test the most patient of people.""

Harry squashed the by now familiar but still unwelcome surge of jealousy and nodded. ""Good. They'll be missing you soon.""

Cedric clapped him on the shoulder. ""Tomorrow morning then. We still need to talk about Snape.""

Harry pulled a face, and Cedric laughed. ""I feel exactly the same way.""

Harry watched him go with a smile, feeling better than he had in a while. They had finally done something that would benefit their school. Hopefully it wouldn't be the only such intervention.

Speaking of which... Harry sighed, and tilted his head back.

""All right,"" he said out loud. ""Let's get started on all this rubbish.""

A moment later he was surrounded by a millennia's worth of forgotten belongings, and he sighed.

""The things I do for this school.""

Cedric stared at the silver ornament, frowned, tilted his head to one side, and squinted some more.

""Is it a duck?""

Harry lowered the item and gave him a look. ""A duck.""

Cedric threw up his hands. ""I don't know! You're the one who's been looking into the thing, why don't you tell me?""

""Why do you think I was asking?"" Harry shot back. ""Either someone got bored halfway through, or they were far too drunk to be working with precious metals."" He paused. ""However, it does appear to be solid silver, so we can always melt it down and use it for something else.""

Cedric watched him send it to the part of the Room they had set aside for potentially useful things, and stared at round at the stacks. ""Well, you're making progress. You should be done by, I don't know, the time we finish Hogwarts?""

Harry pulled a face at him. If the last three weeks had taught him anything, it was that this was not a job for one person. ""Ro was always better at this sort of thing than me,"" he muttered. ""It'll be quicker with all four of us.""

Cedric eyed him a moment, then grabbed his cloak from the back of the chair. ""Come on.""

""What-""

""You've been stuck inside all day, and Helga always said that wasn't good for you.""

""I went for a run this morning,"" Harry shot back, but his protestations were half-hearted at best. After being stuck in the castle all day he was more than ready for some fresh air.

""Feels good to have so much energy, doesn't it,"" said Cedric, as they made their way down the stairs.

Harry snorted. For all that being eleven again was incredibly frustrating, it did have its benefits. Even with Helga's skill at healing, some wounds just didn't heal completely. To be free of all the old aches and pains was a blessing.

Sneaking out of the castle wasn't difficult for the people who had made it, and the two of them were soon strolling round the edge of the lake in companionable silence. The temperature was starting to fall as winter set in, but not unbearably so, and the dreaded snow had yet to set in.

They had made a complete circuit around the lake when Cedric finally spoke.

""Have you thought about what we talked about before.""

Harry sighed, his good mood plummeting. ""Of course I have."" He kicked at a stone, pausing to watch the ripples it made as it disappeared into the water. ""He is clearly a terrible teacher.""

""But he keeps the students safe,"" said Cedric. ""And the ones that enjoy Potions and can work with him go on to do very well indeed.""

""But that's not the way it should be,"" Harry insisted. ""It's fine to be able to get good work out of those who have the enthusiasm and aptitude, but children shouldn't be terrified of going to a class because they know the teacher is going to mock their every effort.""

Cedric's jaw tightened. They had hit upon the crux of the matter there. Severus Snape was an incredibly talented Potions Master, and his NEWT level students were a credit to the school, but the man was a truly abysmal teacher for the average student.

An owl flew over their heads and Harry tilted his head to watch it. It disappeared into the clouds, and he sighed.

""I don't know what we can do about him.""

It was a difficult thing to admit. As nice as it was to be a child again, the lack of influence over his beloved school was becoming increasingly draining. In spite of all his memories and knowledge, there was only so much a nine year old could do.

From the expression on Cedric's face, being an eleven year old wasn't much better.

""Nothing, at the moment,"" he grunted. He leaned against a tree and stared out over the lake. ""I've talked to the older students. His behaviour has earned complaints in the past, but nothing has ever come of them.""

Harry gritted his teeth. ""So all we can do is wait.""

The words left a bitter taste in his mouth, but Salazar had always been a pragmatist.

And he was very good at biding his time.

Minerva settled herself into an armchair and allowed herself a contented sigh. Her cup of tea was warm in her hands, it's fragrance soothing as only tea could be, and for one blissful moment, Minerva was able to put the stress of dealing with four hundred magical teenagers aside. Across the table, Filius and Septima were discussing spellcrafting, with occasional input from Severus, while Pomona and Poppy debated the optimal conditions for the harvesting of dittany.

All conversation faded into respectful silence the moment Albus Dumbledore entered the room though. The Headmaster smiled round the room, but the customary twinkle was missing from his eyes.

""Good afternoon,"" he greeted them. He settled himself in the chair at the head of the table, and steepled his fingers. ""I will not keep you long. I merely wish to inform you of the results of our investigation.""

Minerva set her cup back in its saucer, and leaned forwards. Albus' smile faded. ""Neither myself, nor Head Auror Scrimgeour were able to find any clue as to the identity of the exorcist of Professor Binns.""

Minerva closed her eyes as murmuring erupted around her. She and Albus had spent many hours discussing possible theories, but the list of people who could exorcise a ghost without leaving a trace, let alone enter and leave Hogwarts undetected was short to say the least. No student could have the power or skill to challenge a ghost of Binns' age, and certainly no other teacher would dream of doing so. Albus caught her eye, and raised a hand for silence.

""However, I did invite an representative from the Spirits Division to inspect the scene of the crime."" He paused, probably to build up tension. Albus always did have a flair for the dramatic. ""She was able to identify the spell used as one that required the ghost's agreement in order to send them on.""

There was a stunned silence, then a booming voice rang out. ""Absurd!""

Minerva wasn't the only one to wince at the volume. Herbert Runcorn was a perfectly adequate Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, but he didn't seem to comprehend the notion of an indoor voice. His perpetually red face was set in a scowl as he folded his arms. ""Why would any ghost choose to be exorcised? Binns has taught at this school for generations, for Merlin's sake.""

""Perhaps a better question would be why did the perpetrator choose a spell that required Binns' agreement?"" said Filius thoughtfully. ""It is far simpler to force a spirit on than to convince them to move on of their own accord.""

Runcorn shook his head with a snort. ""Must have lacked the strength. That would explain why they took such pains not to be noticed, they never would have prevailed in a struggle.""

""So we have a magically weak witch or wizard capable of infiltrating Hogwarts, convincing a strongly established ghost to depart, and vanishing without a trace?"" Minerva summarised. She wasn't quite able to keep her disbelief from her voice, and saw her own doubts mirrored on many of her colleagues' faces. Albus sighed.

""I have relayed our theories to the Auror Department, and they will be looking into the matter. In the meantime, I have been searching for a replacement for History of Magic.""

""Good,"" said Minerva firmly. She and the others had been taking it in turns to cover those sessions, with help from the few seventh years who had actually continued the subject to NEWT level, but they really had enough to be getting on with with their own classes.

Albus nodded. ""I have written to my old friend, Bathilda Bagshot. Her great-great-great,"" He paused a moment, eyes twinkling. ""Now, was there another great?""

""Albus,"" said Minerva dryly. She saw Filius cover a smile with a hand, and Septima and Severus exchange withering looks, but Albus' eyes twinkled even more brightly.

""Of course, Minerva. In any case, her niece, Belinda, received an Outstanding in her History of Magic NEWT with us.""

""Yes, she was one of mine,"" said Pomona. ""She's spent the last four years at the University of Alexandria, she still writes every few months.""

Minerva nodded thoughtfully. She too could remember young Belinda, and a more different personality to Binns could scarcely be imagined. ""And she would be willing to cover for the rest of the term?""

Albus inclined his head. ""I am still waiting for her confirmation owl, but she indicated that she would be happy to fill in for the rest of the term. She would be more than welcome to stay on, of course, but should she choose to return to research I will have ample time to find a replacement.""

There was a murmur of approval. Professor Runcorn let out a braying laugh. ""And you thought it was the Defence teachers that you would have problems keeping!""

Filius leaned away, rubbing his ear wearily, but Albus just smiled. ""Indeed, I do hope this will be the end of our staffing troubles for the year.""

""Unless whoever disposed of Binns so efficiently turns their attention elsewhere.""

Severus did have a knack for lowering the mood, Minerva reflected. Albus' eyes narrowed. ""They were able to successfully infiltrate Hogwarts, and yet their sole aim appears to have been to exorcise a single ghost. I doubt that they will return.""

Severus acknowledged the point with a nod, but he wasn't quite finished. ""And yet we have no clues as to their identity. Or what their purpose is.""

Albus was silent for several seconds, and Minerva had to fight back a shiver at the ice in his eyes. It was easy to forget that the eccentric old man was one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Eventually though, Albus visibly relaxed.

""Well, we will remain alert. With time and patience, I am sure that the truth will be revealed."" He leaned back in his chair, and favoured them all with a genial smile. ""And on to more pleasant matters. How are our new first years getting on?""

Pomona brightened, and leaned forwards. ""Very well, as far as I can tell. One of mine, Cedric Diggory, has settled in marvellously.""

Minerva had taken note of that boy herself, and said so. ""He has been at the top of his class from the first day. I've never seen anyone master the initial lessons so quickly.""

""His Charms work is equally impressive,"" Filius chipped in. ""His questions and essays show an almost intuitive understanding of the fundamentals, and he's already starting to draw upon theories I don't usually touch on until third year.""

Runcorn harrumphed loudly. ""Lad's a bit too enthusiastic in my classes. Still, I wouldn't mind hexing those twins myself sometimes, and he's executing every jinx perfectly after a single demonstration.""

Pomona was smiling widely enough that her cheeks had to be hurting. Minerva raised an enquiring eyebrow at Severus, who merely snorted.

""The boy is not entirely incompetent.""

Pomona rolled her eyes. ""Thank you for that assessment, Severus."" Ignoring his sneer, she turned to Albus. ""In all seriousness, Cedric is picking up the material remarkably quickly. We may have to think about some more advanced instruction in the future.""

Albus stroked his beard thoughtfully, and nodded. ""Let us see how he does this year. It is not healthy for students to spend their most enjoyable years trying to cram as much information into their heads as fast as possible.""

Pomona was the first to voice her agreement, and Albus turned twinkling eyes to Minerva. ""And I hear the young Weasley twins are making their mark.""

""The brats are a menace!"" Severus exploded.

""They have yet to fail a single exercise in my classes,"" Minerva shot back. Not that she couldn't understand where her colleague was coming from, but it was only fair to let Albus get an accurate picture.

""They are disrespectful, arrogant, foolhardy-""

""Now, Severus, my boy-""

""Severus, you can hardly complain about the Weasley twins when I spent two hours stripping down brooms after those second years of yours tried to sneak in extra practices,"" Rolanda put in.

""That is completely beside the point!""

Minerva raised an eyebrow at the developing discussion, but contented herself with pouring another cup of tea. At least the rest of the term could only be more peaceful.

Fred looked at George. George looked at Fred.

""You know what I'm thinking?""

""I'm quite sure I do.""

""I think further investigations are necessary, George.""

""I couldn't agree more, Fred.""

Fred leaned on the bannister, and watched the two small figures do a not quite good enough job of sneaking into the school undetected. ""Where has old Ceddy been without us?""

George's attention was on the unfamiliar black-haired boy with his friend. Even as he watched, the two separated, and the stranger was swallowed up in the shadows of the dungeons. ""He's been keeping secrets from us,"" he said quietly.

The two looked at each other again, then back at Cedric, who was making his way towards the passage leading to the Hufflepuff Basement. Cheerful whistling floated up to them, and George elbowed his twin.

""C'mon. Let's get back to the Common Room.""

Fred turned to follow him, his brown eyes gleaming. ""Yes, let's. We've got a project to get started.""

Albus stroked Fawkes' brilliant plumage, and stared at the array of instruments on his desk, and sighed.

""It has been an eventful few months, my friend,"" he murmured.

He had never anticipated losing Cuthbert Binns. The ghost had been a fixture at Hogwarts for centuries. The very idea that someone might exorcise him had been unthinkable, and yet it had happened. That whoever had done so had managed to enter and leave Hogwarts undetected only made matters worse. Amelia Bones had not been pleased, and Albus had been forced to disclose more details about Hogwarts' wards and their security in order to placate her. It was extremely fortunate that whoever was responsible had chosen to only persuade Binns, and had not interacted in any way with any other staff or students.

And that wasn't the only issue of concern. There was still that unexplained explosion of magic over the summer, the curious excitement of the house-elves, the air of almost tangible expectancy that seemed to come from the very castle.

There was the disappearance of Harry Potter.

The monitor on Albus' desk hadn't changed since that fateful morning. Harry was still safe and well, but beyond that, Albus knew nothing.

Albus had even made discreet inquiries among Lily and James' old friends. If anyone had gone to check on the boy, and for some reason decided to remove him from the Dursleys' custody, it was likely to be someone acquainted with the couple, but all of Albus' most subtle probing had resulted in failure.

In the case of Remus Lupin, Albus was beginning to suspect that he had actually done more harm than good. His old student had been both surprised by and wary of the sudden interest, and Albus' inability to answer any of Remus' own questions had caused some understandable frustration. Albus could only hope that the young man wouldn't take matters into his own hands.

Fawkes let out a reassuring trill, and Albus smiled down at his friend.

""I am getting far too old for this.""

After all the excitement of the start of term, the next few weeks were almost boring in comparison. Harry trained with Cedric, read books, and attempted to clear out the piles of useless items in the Room of Requirement, but despite his best efforts none of it was enough to keep his mind occupied.

Eventually, the frustration became too much.

""Where have you been?""

Cedric's cheeks were flushed with excitement, but he offered Harry an apologetic smile. ""Sorry, Harry. The twins were waiting for me again.""

Harry scowled. The Weasley twins had somehow caught on to the fact that Cedric wasn't always where he said he was, and had spent the past month trying to find out what was going on. Having finally realised that Cedric was far too good at disappearing during the day, they had begun waiting for him by the Hufflepuff Basement each morning, which made it very difficult for Cedric to get to the Room of Requirement for their morning sparring sessions. With their time together limited as it was, the interference was getting on Harry's nerves.

Oblivious to Harry's rising irritation, Cedric was still chatting away happily, ""It's pretty impressive actually, they've already found two of our secret passages. I think Bill did give them some hints, but I'm sure none of our first years ever found any that fast.""

""Probably because ours were too busy with useful things,"" Harry muttered. ""Like their studies, and trying not to get burnt alive by Muggles.""

Cedric's eyes narrowed. He studied Harry for a long minute, then sighed, and folded his arms. ""All right, what's the matter with you?""

Harry stared hard at the open book in his hands. ""Nothing."" He turned a page, only to have the book abruptly Summoned out of his hands. ""Don't do that to Rowena or she will hex you. Actually do it, I could use the laugh.""

Cedric didn't take the bait. He set the book carefully on the desk before looking back at Harry. ""You think I'm spending too much time with my other friends.""

The word choice was deliberate, and Harry wasn't quite able to hide his frown. Cedric sighed again, and ran a hand through his dark hair. ""They're my classmates, Harry. I can't exactly avoid them.""

Harry choked back a biting retort with an effort, and instead Summoned his book back. ""I know that.""

Cedric sighed, then came to crouch in front of Harry. ""I know this is hard for you,"" he said gently. ""I'd hate being cooped up in here too, especially after...after everything, but as much as I want to spend more time here, I can't. Fred and George already know that something is going on.""

""Then you should have been more careful,"" Harry snapped.

Cedric's face flushed. ""Don't judge me, Sal. You're not the one having to pretend to be an eleven year old every day!""

Harry blinked, but Cedric had apparently reached the limits of his own patience. ""You don't have to sit in class and act like you couldn't teach the entire curriculum. You don't have to think about every word you say in case someone notices you're hiding an entire other life. You're not the one juggling two different lives while worrying about whether the other two most important people in your life will ever join you!""

Harry was on his feet before he even knew what was happening. ""Don't you dare think I've forgotten them,"" he snarled. ""At least you have some distractions. All I have is the knowledge that I can't leave here because I have literally nowhere to go, my parents are dead, my only other living relatives despise me, and my only friend has new and better friends to spend his time with.""

The temperature in the room rose abruptly, and Harry knew he had gone too far but he suddenly didn't care. Cedric's eyes met his, wide with hurt and anger, but then Harry was gone, down into the Chamber of Secrets, where Cedric knew better than to follow him. The Chamber had always been Salazar's sanctuary, and both of them knew better than to seek the other out when tempers had risen so high.

Harry stood still for several seconds, trying to control the emotions swirling within him. His anger with his friend was rapidly being replaced with shame. Cedric was allowed to have other friends. He needed to have other friends. Harry had always been a loner, and was quite happy with Cedric and Hogwarts, but Godric had always thrived on company. He was at his best when he was supporting and encouraging others.

Jealousy was not an attractive character trait, Harry reflected bitterly. He slumped against one of the ancient columns, uncaring of the damp seeping into his robes as guilt settled heavy in his stomach.

He had sworn that this life would be different, and yet here he was, as self-destructive as before.

Hogwarts' presence brushed his mind in quiet reassurance, but as much as Harry appreciated the gesture he couldn't respond to it. He tilted his head back against the rough stone, letting his gaze wander over his grandfather's carved features.

""I am sorry,"" he whispered.

If his grandfather knew what had become of their family name...

Harry sighed, and pushed himself back to his feet. It was easier to think on the move in this life. He paced down the broad walkway, ignoring the foul-smelling puddles, and trying to let go of his anger. The Weasleys were not a threat to him. He and Godric shared a bond forged over a lifetime. A new childhood friendship was nothing to be jealous of.

Salazar had never been very rational when it came to his friends. Harry had to be better.

He stopped at the base of his grandfather's statue. For a moment he stood still, paralysed by indecision. His mind was clear again, but he wasn't ready to face Cedric just yet. The other boy would probably have gone to classes by now anyway. There was nothing urgent demanding his attention, and he needed a break from digging through the rubbish in the Room of Requirement.

Harry sighed, and laid a hand on the base of his grandfather's statue. A pulse of magic released the wards, and he watched in approval as the stone slab slid aside as smoothly as it had done a thousand years ago. The passage was dark and smelled strongly of damp, but a Lumos and Bubble-Head Charm dealt with that. A minute later he emerged into a much larger cavern, and he stopped short.

Issa had grown. Salazar had expected that. Herpo the Foul's Basilisk had lived for hundreds of years, and had continued to grow fairly steadily all that time.

Seeing it in person was something else.

Harry rested a trembling hand against the green scales. Issa had to be at least sixty feet long. Her eyes were closed, and judging by the layer of dust coating her coils it had been some time since she was last out and about. Harry could hardly blame her. For one thing, it was hard to imagine the amount she would have to eat to remain as active as she had been when she was the size of his arm.

Harry sighed, and stepped back. Issa would wake in time. She was alive and well, and ready to be called upon to defend Hogwarts. That was enough for now.

It didn't matter that the ache in his chest was growing more painful. Harry took a deep breath. He needed to talk to Cedric, but Cedric was in class, and Harry had to do something, anything, to keep his mind off how much of a mess he was. He started to retrace his steps through to the main chamber, then paused.

The rest of the side passages were free of dust.

Harry frowned. He had set various spells to try to keep this place in an acceptable creation, but not even his spellwork should have lasted for hundreds of years. Someone had cast new ones, and fairly recently.

Harry bit his lip. He had shown Murtagh the Chamber, and his nephew had sworn to make sure it was maintained, but there were items in here that had the power to cause unimaginable amounts of harm. They had been locked away behind the strongest wards he could create, but if that magic had degraded too...

At least he had something to keep him occupied until Cedric finished classes.

It took all of Remus Lupin's considerable self-control to contain his fury until after Petunia shut the door. He hadn't known Lily's sister well, for some strange reason Lily had been reluctant to let them spend much time with her, but he had expected better than this.

How bad must things have been for Harry to have run away?

Petunia had told him everything. Remus had even detected a trace of guilt in her eyes, despite her clipped tones, but he couldn't find it in him to have much sympathy for her. It had been an effort just to control his temper, but getting sent to Azkaban for hexing Muggles would hardly help Harry.

Remus' steps faltered. From what little he'd been able to get out of Albus he knew that Harry wasn't with any of James or Lily's other friends. But there was one person that Albus might have missed.

Even after eight years, thinking of Sirius Black was enough to make Remus' vision tint red. He hadn't been able to see Black after his arrest for fear of murdering him on the spot. The very thought that their oldest friend could betray them like that...

With an effort, Remus forced his mind back to the matter at hand. Black had been Voldemort's right-hand man, but Remus knew him. Sirius had always been impetuous and headstrong, but he had never been stupid. He must have known that there was a possibility that Voldemort could be defeated. There was a chance that he had laid contingency plans.

Remus let out a long breath. It was a long shot. Black almost certainly knew nothing. It still had to be worth a try.

And maybe Remus would finally get some answers.

There were a lot of frustrating things about being eleven again. Knowing the curriculum inside out. Being summarily dismissed whenever he tried to take an interest in anything outside of school and sports. Being short.

One thing Cedric had forgotten was how easily distracted children he were. He knew he was supposed to be listening to Professor McGonagall, but he honestly couldn't care less about Switching Spells. Not even the advanced versions that McGonagall had set him working on after he completed the set work in ten minutes in an effort to keep him busy.

Cedric hated fighting with his friends. He might have bickered with Salazar and the others constantly, but proper fights were rare. And now, after spending years living without Salazar only to find him again like this...

Cedric's forehead hit the desk with a thud. This wasn't easy for him, and he had grown up with a loving magical family. Salazar was Harry Potter, and Cedric was the only person he had. The only living person anyway.

Cedric had to talk to him. He had to make things right.

""Mister Diggory.""

Cedric jerked up in time to find McGonagall looming over his desk. Her lips were pinched, and the look she gave him was so reminiscent of Rowena that Cedric had to swallow down the lump in his throat.

""Yes, Professor?""

McGonagall's eyes narrowed. ""Is something the matter, Mister Diggory? I only ask because we are forty minutes into class, and your matchbox and quill remain quite unswitched.""

Cedric felt his cheeks heat up, and he ducked his head. ""Sorry, Professor, I've been distracted."" He waved his wand, remembering at the last moment to actually verbalise the incantation, and watched as the quill gained matchstick strands.

McGonagall's eyebrows shot up. ""Very impressive, Mister Diggory. Five points to Hufflepuff.""

Cedric spotted his housemates exchange grins out of the corner of his eye, but it failed to lift his spirits. ""Thank you, Professor.""

McGonagall held his gaze for a long moment, then nodded to herself. ""See me after class, Mister Diggory. And in the meantime, perhaps you wouldn't mind assisting Mister Summerby?""

Cedric blinked, his eggs and toast suddenly sitting very heavily in his stomach. The last thing he needed was for people to get suspicious in his very first term. Hopefully he hadn't done anything that would seem beyond the capabilities of a gifted eleven year old.

At least he finally had something to keep him distracted. He had really missed teaching. Summerby gave him a bright, relieved smile, and Cedric forced his own problems to one side. He had work to do.

By the time class finished, Cedric had secured Summerby's everlasting gratitude, and twenty more points for Hufflepuff. More than one person patted him on the back as they left the room, and as little as Cedric cared about the competition it was nice to see his friends in good spirits. It wasn't enough to make him forget his worries though, and his stomach was a ball of nerves as he stepped up to McGonagall's desk.

""You wanted to speak to me, Professor?""

""Yes, Mister Diggory."" She placed a stack of papers to one side, and peered at him over her glasses. ""I hope you understand that while Professor Sprout is your Head of House, you may come to any teacher, should you require assistance. Including myself.""

Cedric blinked. That had not been what he was expecting. Warmth flooded his chest, and he smiled. ""Thank you, Professor. I'm sorry I was a bit distracted before."" He hesitated, then realised he didn't actually need to lie. ""I got into a fight with a friend, but I'm going to fix it.""

McGonagall studied him for a long minute, and then to Cedric's surprise her stern face relaxed into a smile. ""That is a very mature attitude, Mister Diggory. See that you do.""

Cedric recognised the dismissal, and gave her a respectful nod before leaving the room. At least he knew that his House was in good hands.

Now all he had to do was talk to Harry.

Easier said than done, especially when he caught a flash of bright red hair in the corridor. Cedric swore under his breath, and ducked in between a pair of older students. He was going to be in for it the next time he saw the twins, but he couldn't find it in him to care. Right now, Salazar was more important. He ducked into a secret passage he was sure Fred and George didn't know about, and closed his eyes.

'Hogwarts?'

The familiar warmth enveloped his mind and soul, and despite his rising stress levels, Cedric had to smile. It was good to be home. 'Yes, Godric?'

'Where is he? The Chamber?'

'Of course. You'll no doubt be pleased to hear that Issa is asleep.'

Cedric shuddered. 'Thank you.'

There was no point in wasting time. Classes were done for the day, and he couldn't think of eating when things were so unsettled. He also knew better than to let Salazar spend too much time brooding.

Cedric sighed, and willed himself to the Chamber.

The place was...not how he remembered it. Salazar must have been apoplectic. Godric cleared the dingy water from the path with a wave of his wand, and squinted round.

""Salazar? Are you here?""

He was disappointed, but not particularly surprised when he didn't receive a reply. There was no sign of anyone in the main chamber, and he changed direction to head for the side passages.

""Salazar, I'm sorry,"" he tried again. ""Can you come out? We need to talk.""

There was a faint crash, and Cedric broke into a run. ""Salazar?""

He dashed around the corner fast enough that he skidded on the damp stone, and had to catch the wall to stay upright. ""Damn it!""

There was another crash, and then a head of messy black hair appeared round the nearest doorway. ""Cedric? What are you doing down here?""

""There you are!"" He straightened his robes with a frown. ""What do you think? I came to apologise.""

Harry bit his lip. ""Cedric-""

""Please, Harry, let me finish. I shouldn't have lost my temper.""

""Neither should I,"" Harry pointed out. He looked away, eyes falling to the floor. ""I was jealous and stupid, and I never should have gotten so upset about your other friends.""

""No,"" Cedric agreed. He crossed the room to grip Harry's shoulder. ""But I understand. I know...I know things haven't been easy for you. Even more so this time round. But I'm here now, and no matter what happens I'm staying. Nothing, and no one, can change that.""

Harry stared up at him, his green eyes impossibly large in his thin face, and Cedric pulled him in for a hug.

""You're my brother, Salazar. I've known you for decades."" He felt Harry twitch in his arms, and hugged him tighter. ""I know you,"" he whispered. ""I didn't go anywhere back then, and I'm not going anywhere now.""

Slowly, Harry's arms wrapped around Cedric's waist and he hugged back, tentatively at first but then so hard it was almost painful. ""I'm sorry,"" he whispered.

Cedric closed his eyes. They would be fine, just like they always were. He would get better at making time for Harry, and Harry would stop being quite so possessive. They only had to do this for two years, and then they could forget about the secrecy. They would be fine.

Harry let out a shaky breath and stepped back.

""I'm glad you came down here.""

Cedric ruffled his hair. ""Me too.""

""Not because of this,"" said Harry quickly. ""Well, not just because of it anyway.""

Unease started to coil in Cedric's stomach. ""What are you talking about?""

Harry looked around, his face as grim as Cedric had ever seen it. ""Someone has been down here. Recently.""

Cedric felt the blood drain from his face. Only someone of Salazar's blood could enter here, and considering what they had been able to trace of his family, and what was generally assumed of Slytherins in this time...

Harry caught his eye and nodded. ""We have to work out what they did.""

Dinner could wait. If Cedric's suspicions were correct, neither of them would be feeling much like eating.

The Chamber of Secrets used to be one of Salazar's favourite places in Hogwarts. The other Founders had contributed to its construction of course, but Salazar had designed it and placed the wards that would keep it secure, and it was his, just like the Room was Rowena's. The others were welcome, and always would be, but the Chamber was his.

After the past couple of weeks, Harry was beginning to wish that he never had to set foot in there again.

The place had been ransacked. All the cursed weapons and objects that he had Godric had spent so long hunting down were gone. Admittedly, some of them were more like trinkets that Rowena had asked them to keep away from their students, but too many could cause serious harm. There was a reason Salazar had made these wards so powerful.

Worse still, the books were gone.

A hand came to rest on his shoulder, and Harry was tired enough to lean into the touch.

""Have you been down here all night?""

Harry shrugged. ""If it's morning, then yes. Shouldn't you be in class?""

""Not yet, and we were worried about you,"" said Cedric gently. He settled down on the floor next to Harry and stretched his legs out. ""You can't keep brooding down here.""

""I know,"" Harry muttered. ""But I can't be out searching for whoever was stupid enough to take those books either. I can't do anything.""

Objectively he knew he was being ridiculous. There was no way of telling when the Chamber had been raided, or what had happened to everything that had been taken, but Harry couldn't help it. The rituals in those books were dangerous. They had been dangerous a thousand years ago, and with the advances that had been made since...

Cedric sighed. ""I know. It's maddening. But we just can't do anything yet."" He looped an arm round Harry's shoulders. ""And remember that this time its not just people like us dealing with such threats. There's an entire branch of the government dedicated to protecting people. We have to trust them until we're older.""

Harry scowled. Trust had never been one of his strong points, but Cedric was right. There simply wasn't anything they could do. Maybe when Helga and Rowena arrived...

""At least it'll be Christmas soon,"" said Cedric. ""We'll have to work out what we're going to do.""

Harry raised an eyebrow. Thanks to the Dursleys he cared for Christmas even less than he had in his first life. ""We're only two weeks into November,"" he pointed out. ""We've got more pressing matters to worry about.""

""Actually, we don't,"" said Cedric gently. ""We're children, remember? We've dealt with Binns, Bagshott has settled down and is an excellent teacher, our students are safe, and this is our first Christmas in centuries. We need a break.""

Harry just scowled at the floor. Cedric sighed, and disentangled himself from Harry and stood up. ""Look, I've got class, but this isn't over. Also, Helena wants to talk to you.""

That was enough to break Harry's attention from his bad mood. ""What? Why?""

""How about you ask her, and find out."" He reached down to pull Harry to his feet, but didn't let go straight away. ""I know how important this is to you,"" he said softly, ""but you can't spend the next two years dwelling on things you can't change.""

Harry let out a soft snort. ""Of course I could. Dwelling on things I can't change is one of my specialities.""

Cedric rolled his eyes. ""Why did I miss him?"" he asked, and Harry felt Hogwarts' amusement echo in his own mind. He aimed a half-hearted kick that his friend dodged easily. ""See? You've spent so long brooding that you're getting slow.""

""All right, all right,"" Harry grumbled. ""You've made your point. I'll stop coming down here as much.""

That didn't mean he would stop thinking about it, and judging from the gleam in Cedric's eyes the older boy knew it, but it was a start. Harry closed his eyes and willed himself back to the Room of Requirement. The piles of rubbish didn't do much to improve his mood.

The was a faint crack as Cedric appeared next to him. The older boy sighed.

""I've got to get to Herbology, but please try to stop obsessing. Go and find Helena, that'll cheer you up.""

Harry wasn't sure seeing the ghost of his surrogate niece would do much to cheer up him up, but he managed to refrain from saying so. Cedric squeezed his shoulder. ""I'll see you this evening, all right?""

""Thanks,"" Harry mumbled.

Cedric clapped him on the back and headed off, though not without a worried backward look. Harry sighed. He had caused Godric enough stress in his first life. He forced his own frustrations to the side and headed out after his friend. Time to see what Helena needed.

Alastor Moody wasn't one to dwell on the past. He was an Auror, and knew damn well that regrets were a waste of time. Far better to focus on the task at hand.

That didn't stop him occasionally cursing the Death Eaters that had cost him his leg. He kicked aside the chair that had threatened to entangle his prosthesis, and rapped on the office doorframe.

""Got a minute?""

Scrimgeour snorted. ""But, Alastor, don't you know how much I love reviewing Ministerial audits?"" He shoved the papers aside with a contemptuous flick of his hand, and waved Alastor to a chair. ""Paper-pushing imbeciles.""

Alastor smirked as he eased his aching body into the proffered seat. ""Told you taking that job was a mistake.""

""So you did,"" Scrimgeour grumbled. ""And every other day since."" He looked at the papers like he wanted to incinerate them, before reluctantly shaking his head and glancing back at Alastor. ""Anyway. What do you need?""

Alastor hesitated. He had served alongside Scrimgeour for years, and considered the younger wizard a friend as well as a comrade, but this was tricky. Scrimgeour, like Amelia Bones, had made his views on independent action very clear during the War. There was a good chance of this sparking old arguments.

But then, Scrimgeour had also understood what had to be done, and despite refusing to align with Dumbledore and the Order, he had turned a blind eye to others doing so. He had even passed along key information at times, though always with the proviso that no one else should know how a humble Auror came by such details.

When it came down to it, Alastor trusted Scrimgeour, and that wasn't something to be taken lightly.

""I've just had an interesting conversation,"" he began, ""with Remus Lupin.""

Scrimgeour cocked his head to one side, but he said nothing and Alastor continued, ""He is requesting a visit with Sirius Black.""

Scrimgeour's amber eyes narrowed. ""I see.""

Alastor grunted. It had been nearly seven years since Black's incarceration, and in all that time the Death Eater had never had a single visitor. Alastor himself had never even considered the idea, partly, he had to admit, out of wounded pride. He had badly misjudged Black, and the Potters had paid the price. He should have known better.

""Did Lupin give a reason?""

Alastor pulled himself back to the present, and shook his head. ""Just that he wanted an explanation.""

""Wouldn't we all?"" Scrimgeour muttered. He ran a hand through his hair and scowled at Alastor. ""You knew them. What do you think?""

Alastor scratched at his mutilated nose. ""He was telling the truth."" All the young ones had quickly learned better than to try lying to him, and Lupin had always had the most common sense of his friends. ""But he was hiding something. He was worried.""

He didn't say anything else. He didn't need to. Scrimgeour met his eyes, and nodded. ""The visit is approved. You will supervise.""

Alastor nodded, but a glance from Scrimgeour kept him in his seat. The Head Auror's face was as grim as Alastor had ever seen it. ""Black was You-Know-Who's right hand man,"" he said quietly. ""If there is anyone who might have knowledge of any other plans, it's Black.""

Alastor just nodded again. They had fought one war. They would do whatever it took to avoid a second.

Tracking down a ghost wasn't as difficult as it sounded. At least not if one was intimately connected to Hogwarts' wards, and had the full cooperation of the castle itself. It also helped when one had known the ghost in question since she was born, and knew every one of her favourite hiding spots.

Harry weaved in and out of the crowds of students, easily going unnoticed in the chaos. The crowds made his skin itch, but he couldn't deny that the anonymity was a welcome change. It probably wouldn't last long once he officially arrived and everyone knew who he was, and Harry fully intended to make the most of it until then.

It didn't take long to leave the students behind. Harry ducked down secret passages and climbed hidden staircases that had long lain undisturbed, judging from the thick layers of dust, until he finally emerged onto a small balcony overlooking the northernmost staircase.

The torches were lit as always, but Helena's shimmering form still drew Harry's eye. Her face was still set in the mask of grim sadness that Harry had become so familiar with over the past few months, and the sight made his chest ache. What had happened to the laughing child who had clung to his ankles and helped him throw snowballs at Godric? He shook the thought away and stepped forward.

""Helena?""

Ghosts couldn't exactly jump, but Helena did turn to him. ""Uncle.""

""You wanted to see me?"" said Harry slowly. There was something wrong here. Helena was avoiding his gaze in the exact same way she used to when she had been hiding something from him as a child. ""What's wrong?""

The faintest trace of a smile touched Helena's face. ""I never could get anything past you."" She sighed, and looked him straight in the eye. ""The last boy who opened your Chamber.""

Harry froze. ""What of him?""

""I...I spoke to him once. About who I am. And about Edmund.""

Harry stared at her. Over the last couple of months he had watched Helena interact with the students. Though always polite and helpful, at least to the Ravenclaws, she kept everyone at a distance. Even with Professor Flitwick, she remained cordial at best.

He couldn't imagine her telling anyone about her death.

And if the one person he had told had also had the ability to enter the Chamber of Secrets...

""He was interested in you,"" Helena said softly. ""All four of you. What descendants you had, what magic you created, the items you made, he wanted to know everything."" She looked away. ""He was very charming, and it...it had been a long time.""

Harry closed his eyes. ""I understand."" If he had been on his own for a thousand years, he might want to talk to someone now and then too. He forced the thought away and looked back at her. ""What else can you tell me about him?""

Helena frowned. ""Very little. He was a Slytherin. He was particularly interested in you. He applied for the post of Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher after leaving, but Headmaster Dumbledore refused.""

""Why?"" Harry asked.

""I do not know,"" said Helena. ""I don't think he trusted him."" She hesitated. ""There is something else, Salazar. It...you will not like to hear this.""

""What else is new?"" Harry muttered. ""Tell me.""

Helena bit her lip. ""He didn't just open the Chamber.""

Harry stared at her, and then everything fell into place with horrifying clarity. ""He believed what they say about me. He believed what they say the Chamber was built for.""

Nausea swirled in his gut, and he sat down before his knees gave out. The pounding of blood in his ears was deafening, and every breath burned in his lungs. What had Selene's descendent done? How had everything gone so wrong?

Then he barely choked back a cry as something icy cold touched the back of his neck. He jerked away, and only then became aware of Helena's voice, shrill with barely-contained panic.

""-for me, Salazar, you have to breathe. You need to calm down.""

He was scaring her. Harry sucked in a desperate gasp of air, and was rewarded with a relieved prayer. ""That's it, Salazar. Everything is all right.""

""No,"" Harry whispered. ""No, it isn't.""

His Chamber had been opened and used for the opposite of its intended purpose. Harry had read enough to know what scholars had assumed Issa was for. The lump in his throat threatened to choke off his speech, but he had to know. ""Was...was anyone hurt?""

Helena's silence was all the answer he needed. Harry buried his face in his arms. ""He hurt my students.""

Worse still, he had used Issa to hurt students. Harry tasted bile in the back of his throat, and concentrated on the pain of his nails digging into his palms to keep from throwing up. Everything good thing he had tried to do for the school had gone wrong.

""This wasn't your fault, Salazar,"" Helena whispered.

""I was the one who hid a Basilisk in my school,"" Harry growled. ""I should have known better. Rowena and Godric were right.""

""You couldn't have known that your family would become so twisted,"" said Helena firmly. Harry glared at her, but Helena didn't give him a chance to interrupt, ""And it was not always this way. Many of Selene's line found the Chamber, and not one of them betrayed your trust. If not for Issa, this school would have fallen in the thirteenth century.""

Harry finally looked up at that. Helena gave him a small smile. ""All you wanted was to protect the school, and you did.""

Harry took a deep breath, then another. ""Issa is my responsibility,"" he said quietly. ""When did this happen?""

There was definite wariness in Helena's eyes as she looked at him. ""About fifty years ago.""

Harry's jaw tightened. Fifty years was nothing to wizards. If he was still alive, then Harry would find him. ""What was his name?""

Helena's whisper sounded like a thunderstorm in the silence, ""Tom Riddle.""

Cedric was worried.

This was in no way an unusual occurrence when Salazar was concerned. Godric had spent most of his life worrying about his friend. He had known from the start that things would be no different with Harry.

Things would be much easier when Rowena and Helga were back.

For now though it was just Cedric, and if there was one thing he was good at it was managing Salazar's moods. Admittedly, he had never had to deal with a Salazar that had found out that one of his distant relatives had released a Basilisk into the castle and killed a student and whose reputation was in ruins, but Cedric was never one to back down from a challenge.

This time he didn't need to ask where Harry was. He started for the seventh floor, performing the usual detour into one of the more obscure secret passages in order to avoid the Weasley twins. The pair were really starting to get on his nerves.

He arrived at the Room of Requirement a few minutes later, only slightly out of breath, and slipped inside before anyone could interrupt. He was met by the now familiar sight of towering piles of rubbish.

""Harry? Where are you?""

There was no reply. Cedric sighed, and started to pick his way through the stacks. ""Come on, Harry. We need to talk.""

There was a faint crash, and Cedric changed direction slightly. He squeezed in between a broken cabinet and a gargoyle, to find Harry digging through a trunk. The younger boy spared him only a brief scowl.

""Don't you have class?""

""Maybe I need to give you a copy of my timetable,"" Cedric muttered under his breath. ""They finished an hour ago, and I've eaten. Unlike you.""

It was a guess, but a very reasonable one based on experience. The snort he received confirmed it. ""I can eat later.""

Cedric rubbed his eyes. ""Really? Because you said that yesterday, and Teaky told me you didn't touch anything.""

Harry muttered something under his breath. Cedric sighed, and knelt next to him. ""Harry, you do realise that you haven't left this room in nearly a week, don't you?""

Harry blinked, then dismissed the information with a scowl. ""This is more important. Helena said Riddle brought back Rowena's Diadem, and she is convinced that he hid it here. I have to find it. I have to find out what he was up to.""

Cedric sighed, and reached out to grip Harry's shoulders. The younger boy resisted, but Cedric forced him to look round. ""Yes, we do,"" he said grimly. ""But you don't have to do it right now."" Harry's collarbones were worryingly sharp under his hands, and Cedric had to fight the urge to shake some sense into him. ""Whatever Riddle did, it was over fifty years ago, and it hasn't caused any damage. You don't have to kill yourself trying to find it right away.""

""You don't know that,"" Harry snapped. He rubbed angrily at his scar. ""I'm sure that he is linked to the Dark magic here, and Dark magic is harmful by its very definition. I have to find it.""

Cedric sighed. ""We will,"" he repeated. ""But right now, you're getting some fresh air.""

That did the trick. Harry's gaze finally shifted from the surrounding rubbish, and he looked at Godric in outright horror. ""Outside?"" he repeated. ""It's November! There's already snow! And you're already past your curfew.""

""Yes, Salazar, I really care about curfew,"" said Cedric dryly. ""And don't start about snow, your leg doesn't hurt any more. Besides,"" he said, when Harry tried to open his mouth, ""I've got something special planned.""

Harry eyed him. ""When you say special-""

""No, it has nothing to do with dragons,"" Cedric snapped. ""You're not Helga.""

""Are you sure? Because I remember the last special adventure you took me on very vividly, and I do not need another practical lesson on our school motto.""

Cedric couldn't help a snort of laughter, and felt a warm glow when the corner of Harry's mouth twitched. ""It has nothing to do with dragons, or any other dangerous beasts,"" he promised. ""It'll be fun, I swear.""

Harry still looked sceptical, but Cedric was used to that. He knew exactly what he was doing.

""He dodged us again.""

""I know,"" Fred snapped. ""I was there."" George rolled his eyes, and Fred sighed. ""Sorry. I just don't get what's going on with him.""

George grunted an acknowledgement. Fred slumped back into the armchair, letting his gaze drift around the Common Room. ""This would have been so much easier if he had ended up in Gryffindor too.""

Honestly, he had been convinced that their friend would be joining them. Cedric had always been up for adventures for as long as they had known him, and he never backed down from a challenge.

George, though, was shaking his head. ""I don't know. I thought he was going to be a Ravenclaw, what with all the time he spent talking about school with Bill and Percy.""

""Nah, he's too much fun for a Ravenclaw,"" said Fred.

""They're not actually that bad,"" George pointed out. ""Have you seen that third year who can make a light show when she plays violin?""

""Okay yeah, that is cool,"" Fred admitted, ""but Cedric still should be with us!""

Someone cleared their throat behind them. ""If I might interrupt for a moment?""

""Why ask when you're going to do it anyway?"" Fred muttered. George elbowed him, and he pulled a face. ""What do you want, Percy?""

Percy cleared his throat again and pushed his glasses further up his nose. ""I just wanted to point out that Cedric being in a different house doesn't mean he's not your friend any more. I have plenty of friends in other houses.""

Fred opened his mouth, then closed it again when George kicked him. Percy eyed them both until George sighed. ""We know, and we've been trying, but it's hard. Especially when he's avoiding us.""

Percy sniffed. ""I highly doubt he's ignoring you. Just because he's in a different house-""

""But that's not the problem!"" Fred exploded. He pushed himself to his feet and started pacing in front of the fire. ""He never waits for us after class, he always tries to dodge us in the corridors, half of the time we don't even see him at meals! There's something wrong, and we're going to find out what.""

Because at the end of the day Cedric was their friend, and Fred knew there was something wrong and so nothing was going to stop him from helping. George's eyes met his in perfect understanding and agreement, and Fred felt his frustration cool to a steady glow. Cedric was smart and good at keeping secrets, but they were Weasleys. Nothing could stop them from helping a friend.

Although Percy might be a problem. Fred glared at his older brother, but before he could say anything Percy nodded.

""That doesn't sound like him at all. Is there anything I can do?""

Fred felt a rare surge of affection for the stuffiest member of the family, but then found himself hesitating. The only real clue they had about Cedric's behaviour was the boy they had seen him with that one time, and that wasn't much to go on. They hadn't even been able to get a good look at him. George caught his eye and coughed.

""Not really. We're just going to keep an eye on him and see if we can figure it out.""

Percy sighed. ""Or you could just talk to him?""

Twin snorts met his words. Percy rolled his eyes. ""He's your friend. Why can't you talk to him?""

""Have you tried getting anything out of Cedric when he doesn't want to tell you?"" Fred demanded. ""He's impossible!""

George nodded. ""It's been three years and we still don't know how he speaks Mandarin.""

""Exactly."" Fred dropped back into the armchair and folded his arms. ""He's not going to tell us anything. We've got to be more sneaky.""

""Merlin help us,"" Percy muttered.

Fred glanced at George, and saw his own mischief mirrored in his twin's eyes. As one they turned to Percy.

""Hey, Perce, you still interested in helping us out?""

The alarm that lit Percy's eyes was almost enough to make Fred forget his frustration. They would find out what Cedric was hiding eventually. It would probably end up being a disappointment, but they would have fun trying. If they could get Percy to loosen up too, that was just a nice bonus.

""It really shouldn't be this easy to sneak out of the school.""

Harry didn't need to look to know that Cedric was rolling his eyes. ""The students don't have our advantages. And they definitely don't know about some of these passages.""

""Not even the Weasleys?"" Harry asked.

This time Cedric did glance back long enough to scowl at him. ""Stop it. They've only been here a couple of months."" He paused. ""And even they won't find this one. Now hurry up.""

Harry grinned, but stepped up his pace. He had no intention of admitting it, but he had needed to get out of the Room of Requirement. He needed to keep working, to find out what Riddle had done to their school, but Cedric was right. Burning out wouldn't do anyone any good. He knew that from experience.

Harry had always loved Hogwarts at night. Without the crowds of students he was free to soak in the ambient magic of the castle, and all without having to worry about hiding from the rest of its inhabitants. He followed Cedric through the familiar passages, neither of them bothering with a light. Cedric had refused to tell him what they were doing, but just the idea of getting some fresh air was looking more and more appealing. Maybe he had spent too much time inside over the last couple of weeks.

""Hopefully the caretaker doesn't know about this one,"" Cedric murmured. ""Charlie said he can be a pain to dodge.""

""I think we'll manage,"" said Harry dryly.

Even without Hogwarts keeping an eye out for them, no one knew the castle better than they did. Cedric grinned back at him, then held up a hand as they reached the exit. For a minute they both froze, then Cedric relaxed.

""All right, everything's good. Come with me.""

Harry followed close on his heels, tugging his cloak more tightly around himself. They had been lucky enough to avoid any heavy snowfalls so far, but the November night was still bitterly cold. He pushed himself into a jog, enjoying the lack of pain shooting through his leg.

""Are you going to tell me where we're going yet?""

Cedric shook his head. ""Still not a fan of surprises, I see."" He tapped Harry's shoulder to direct him through the grounds towards a set of small huts. ""Down there.""

Harry frowned. He'd seen the buildings from a distance when he went running in the mornings, but he hadn't gotten round to investigating further. He let Cedric pass him, and followed his friend down until they came to a stop. The door was sealed with a simple locking charm that Cedric disposed of with embarrassingly little effort before turning to grin at Harry.

""You'll enjoy this.""

Harry quirked an eyebrow, but one look inside left him gaping. ""You have got to be joking.""

Cedric burst out laughing. ""I'm serious, Harry.""

""I am not going flying! You do remember how awful they are, don't you?""

He tried to back away, but Cedric threw an arm around his shoulders. ""Of course I do. It was like sitting on a stick."" He grinned. ""However, everyone else agreed and someone invented a wonderful spell known as the Cushioning Charm.""

Harry hesitated. Cedric didn't waste the chance, ""And there have been so many other developments. You know how even the best made brooms could barely go faster than a horse? Well, the latest Cleansweep can do nought to sixty in ten seconds! And you have got to see a professional Quidditch match, you have no idea what sort of things they can do nowadays-""

""All right,"" Harry interrupted. ""I'll give it a try.""

Cedric's smile was dazzling in the moonlight. ""Thank you, Harry. I promise you won't regret it.""

Harry scowled, but it was half-hearted at best. He was never able to say no to Godric when he got so excited about something. Not that much had changed. He sighed, and followed Cedric into the hut. ""Let's get on with this.""

He reached for the nearest broom, only for Cedric to grab his wrist. ""Not that one! Look at the tail twigs, it'll be constantly drifting to the left! And not that one either,"" he added, when Harry changed direction. ""See how the wood is warped? That will make it more unpredictable and harder to control.""

Harry folded his arms. ""I thought you said these things were good.""

""They are,"" said Cedric. ""But these are ancient because the governors won't pay for new ones. Bill and Charlie have been complaining about them for years."" His expression turned thoughtful. ""You know, these brooms really aren't safe for our students-""

""You are not setting them on fire,"" Harry interrupted. ""Just show me which one is the best for a beginner.""

Cedric pouted, an expression that did not work nearly as well as Helga's did, but walked up and down the racks studying the brooms and muttering under his breath. Harry waited as patiently as he could, until finally Cedric sighed and selected one of the brooms.

""Try this one. It's missing a lot of twigs so it won't accelerate properly, but that's probably for the best as it's your first time.""

""Thanks,"" said Harry dryly.

At least the thing looked better than they used to. He could feel the spells holding it together, as well as many more that he couldn't identify but which felt like speed and flight. The magic soothed the knot of anxiety in the pit of his stomach, and Cedric clapped him on the shoulder. ""Ready?""

Harry took a deep breath, and followed him back out into the open. Cedric led them a little way across the lawn before he stopped and turned back to Harry. ""This will be all right for now,"" he said. ""Maybe if we do this again we'll try out the Quidditch stadium.""

Harry bit back what he really wanted to say, but something must have shown on his face because Cedric rolled his eyes. ""Anyway, this is how you mount a broom.""

Godric had always been a good teacher, and a few minutes later found Harry seated far more comfortably than he had expected and ready to go. Cedric had mounted his own broom and manoeuvred it round so that was facing Harry.

""All right, so now we're going to kick off gently.""

Harry nodded stiffly. His hands were beginning to shake from the cold, and he gripped the broom tighter. Cedric caught his eye. ""I'll be right here,"" he promised. ""The second I think something's going wrong I can take control of your broom and guide it back down.""

Harry's trembling eased. He let out a long breath, and kicked off.

Flying was nothing like he remembered. Flying a thousand years ago had been painful and uncomfortable and terrifying.

Flying now was wonderful.

Harry had intended to go slowly. He knew his limits, and he wasn't going to do anything that Cedric hadn't shown him how to do, but flying wasn't difficult, flying was easy and instinctive and Harry couldn't help himself. For the first time in a long time all his worries fell away and he lost himself in the sheer thrill of flight.

""Harry!""

He had also completely forgotten about Cedric. Harry spun the broom round to hover in midair, and a moment later Cedric came to a halt in front of him. The older boy's eyes were very wide.

""Where did you learn how do to that?""

Harry laughed. ""I don't know,"" he said breathlessly, ""but this is incredible. Race you to the lake!""

He didn't give Cedric a chance to argue, but he heard laughter echo through the night sky and gave in to his own grin. The was the best thing he had done in months.

They spent longer than they should have testing out the brooms. Cedric showed Harry some of the tips and tricks he had learned from Charlie Weasley, and Harry let himself forget the stresses of the last few weeks. This was something new and something he could do well and Harry revelled in it.

Eventually though Cedric turned his broom towards the ground. Harry followed, taking the last opportunity to get as much speed out of the broom as possible, and landed lightly on the grass. Cedric quirked an eyebrow at him, and Harry was too flushed with exhilaration to care.

""Yes, you were right. That was fun.""

Cedric threw an arm round his shoulders. ""I'm glad you liked it. Though if Ro and Helga ask, you didn't do any of those stunts on your very first flight, okay?""

Harry ducked his head. He hadn't been able to resist. Cedric gave him a light shake. ""We can do this again tomorrow night. I'll see if I can sneak out some Quidditch balls too. There's no way you won't make the house team if you can fly like that now.""

""Thank you,"" said Harry quietly.

Cedric had always known what he needed. Cedric's arm tightened around his shoulders. ""You're allowed to be a kid for a few years, Sal.""

Harry wanted to argue, but with his heart still racing and the thrill of flight was still humming through his mind and he just couldn't find the words. Cedric just smiled, and pulled him into a quick hug, and under the starlit sky in the presence of his best friend, Harry finally let himself relax.

""You know,"" said Cedric, ""new brooms really are a lot better. As well as safer.""

Harry stared at him, but the combination of more speed, more comfort, and more manoeuvrability, was incredibly tempting. And it would be harder for Muggle-borns to learn on these ancient brooms. Flying was tricky enough without having to control a misbehaving broom, and the last thing first years needed was to get hurt during a lesson...

Cedric's grin was bigger than ever, and Harry rolled his eyes. ""Fine. But at least try to keep it inconspicuous.""

""Of course,"" said Cedric gravely. His eyes were gleaming. ""I found the best book of fire spells in the library, and I've been waiting to try them out.""

Harry couldn't help it. He burst out laughing.

Alastor knocked brusquely on the door to Scrimgeour's office and pushed it open without waiting for a response. Scrimgeour raised an eyebrow, but had known him long enough to just wave him to a seat. Alastor did so, but not before kicking the door shut. They were the only ones still working, but there was no point in taking chances. He added the usual secrecy spells, and waited for Scrimgeour to add his own before he started to speak.

""I can't find the transcripts from Sirius Black's trial.""

Scrimgeour's amber eyes narrowed, and he leaned back in his chair. ""There's no shortage of people who could have accessed them.""

That had been Alastor's first thought too. ""Tried all the usual places. And the unusual ones. There's nothing except the records of his apprehension and transfer to Azkaban.""

Scrimgeour stilled completely. ""Can you think of any reason why someone would tamper with the trial records, and yet leave those?""

""No,"" Alastor growled. ""Which leaves one possibility.""

Scrimgeour's hand clenched on his cane. Alastor didn't even try to hide his own contempt. Neither of them had been on active duty at the time of Voldemort's defeat; Alastor due to having his leg blown off, while Scrimgeour had still been recovering from a particularly vicious curse to his knee that had refused to stop bleeding until what seemed like half of St Mungo's and Albus Dumbledore himself had joined forces on the problem. That didn't mean they were unaware of the chaos that had followed Voldemort's defeat.

Too few Aurors and too many convicts were no excuse for not giving proper trials.

Alastor could see the anger building in his boss' eyes, but Scrimgeour's voice remained quiet.

""The visit has been authorised for three days from now. Take note of whatever Black says. Find out what happened.""

Alastor raised an eyebrow. ""Shouldn't there be more than one Auror in attendance for that?""

""There should have been a trial,"" Scrimgeour snarled. He took a moment to collect himself, the frustration vanishing under his usual languid calm, before continuing, ""I'll talk to Amelia, but going through the proper channels will take too long. We might as well get a head start.""

Alastor nodded. He had no problem with that. No matter what Black had done, everyone deserved a fair trial. They would get to the truth, one way or another.

Remus Lupin had been terrified of Azkaban for as long as he could remember. As a child his grandmother had told him stories that had given him nightmares for months. After he became a werewolf, after he became dangerous, the fear had only increased. Even now, as a fully trained wizard capable of producing a perfectly adequate Patronus, just thinking about Dementors was enough to make him break out in a sweat.

Sirius had been in Azkaban for eight years.

He deserved it. He had betrayed Lily and James to Voldemort, he had got them killed, he had murdered Peter. If anyone deserved imprisonment in that hell it was Sirius Black.

Or so Remus had spent eight years trying to tell himself.

The boat lurched, and Remus grabbed hold of the side before he took an unwelcome dip in the North Sea. The spells propelling the boat were perfectly adequate, but not exactly designed with passenger comfort in mind.

""Careful, Lupin,"" came a gravelly voice. ""The boat won't stop for you.""

Remus glanced round. Alastor's magical eye was spinning in every direction, but there was a definite glint in his real one. Remus snorted. ""You tried that one on us during the war, Alastor, and we didn't believe it then.""

""Pettigrew did,"" Alastor shot back. ""So did Potter, for that matter.""

Despite the awful circumstances, Remus had to smile at the memory. For one of the most brilliant people Remus had ever known, James had had his moments of being remarkably trusting. Remus and Peter had taken full advantage of his lack of knowledge about the Muggle world, and the older members of the Order had seized on the rare moments of levity.

The smile died though as Alastor nodded past him.

""There we are, lad. Hell on earth.""

Remus swallowed. It had been a bright winter morning when they left. Now the sky was thick was grey clouds, and the high walls of Azkaban seemed to suck out what little light remained. A shiver wracked his body. They were too far for the Dementors to be affecting him, but just the thought...

""Lupin. Focus.""

""Yes, sir,"" said Remus automatically, before remembering that he wasn't in the Order any more and flushing. Alastor just rolled his eyes.

""Mind the bump as we dock. And let me do that talking.""

""That's fine by me,"" said Remus. He had no intention of going anywhere near the guards. He braced himself against the side of the boat as they drew alongside the pier, and watched as the ropes uncoiled themselves and secured the vessel.

Alastor hopped ashore with far more agility than would be expected of a man with a wooden leg. Remus followed more reluctantly. Thick fog was rolling down from the tower, and he shivered. Already he could feel the presence of the Dementors bearing down on him, bringing all the thoughts of his losses and failures bubbling to the surface of his mind...

""Focus, Lupin,"" Alastor snapped. ""Or stay in the boat.""

Lupin shook his head. ""Yes, sorry. I'll be fine.""

He would have been insulted by the scepticism in Alastor's eye if he wasn't feeling so awful. Alastor jabbed his wand, and a brilliant silver badger burst into life at his feet. Immediately the growing feelings of despair faded, and Remus took a shaky breath. He fumbled for his own wand, a moment later his wolf joined Alastor's badger. Alastor quirked an eyebrow, and Remus flushed.

""I can make it noncoporeal,"" he muttered.

Alastor's other eyebrow shot up. ""Impressive control, but stick to that one for now. Come on."" He started down the path to the prison, then paused, and glanced back. ""Concentrate on your Patronus, or whatever memory is sustaining it. Keep that at full power. Don't look at the Dementors, don't look at the prisoners, and don't wander off.""

Remus swallowed. ""Don't worry about that.""

He stuck a bit closer to Alastor than was strictly necessary as they made their way along the path, but the Auror didn't say anything. Two Dementors were stationed at the entrance, but Alastor's stride didn't falter as he stomped forward.

""Alastor Moody, Auror, with Remus Lupin. We are here on the authorisation of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.""

For a moment neither Dementor moved, but Alastor held firm and they finally moved aside. Remus took a deep breath, pushed more power into his wolf, and followed Alastor into Azkaban. The cold increased as he passed the Dementors, but the wolf pressed close against his side and Remus forced himself to keep looking straight ahead. He wasn't a criminal. He was allowed to be here. He had nothing to be afraid of.

""He's in cell 39,"" Alastor muttered. ""Let's get this over with.""

Several corridors and three flights of stairs later, Remus was all but ready to flee back to the boat. The stench of the Dementors was making his nose burn, and even with the two Patronuses it was a struggle to keep his worst memories from overwhelming him.

It was small consolation that Alastor was also looking pale by the time they reached the right floor.

""Not going to miss this part of the job,"" he grunted. The badger nosed at his knee, and he straightened. ""That way.""

""You're retiring?"" Remus asked. He'd thought the older man would die at his post.

""Focus, Lupin.""

Remus suppressed a sigh, and followed. Maybe he was too easily distracted. Now that he was there though, there was no hiding from the fact that was about to come face to face with his only surviving friend. One of the people who had made his school years bearable, and had gone on to murder three of their friends.

For once, Alastor didn't prompt him into action. In fact his dark eye was surprisingly gentle. Remus took a deep breath, and stepped in front of the bars.

He had to squint to see anything. The only light came from a flickering torch by the stairs, and Sirius' cell was one of the furthest along. All he could make out was a misshapen lump hidden in the shadows, and after a moment's hesitation Remus waved his wolf closer to the bars.

""Sirius?""

In the silver light of the Patronus the lump coalesced into a mound of tattered blankets. Remus' stomach lurched as he took in the grimy cell, with the stained stone floor and the streaks of mould on the walls. Sirius had spent the last eight years here, in a cell that was barely five paces long.

""Sirius?""

There was still no answer. Alastor rolled his eyes and stomped forward. ""Black,"" he barked. ""On your feet. We're here to talk to you.""

For a minute there was no reply, then the blankets shifted. A head of matted black hair, so different from the shining waves Remus remembered, appeared, and then Remus found himself frozen in place at the sight of his best friend.

Sirius looked...insane. His skin was waxy, and so stretched over his bones that he could have been a corpse. The wild hair, beard, and moustache only added to the impression, but worse still were the eyes. In Remus' memories they sparkled with fire and mischief. Now they burned with an obsession bordering on the deranged. It took a moment for them to focus on Remus, then the cracked lips drew up in a slash of a smile.

""Hello, Moony,"" he rasped. ""It's been a while.""

""Hello, Sirius,"" said Remus quietly.

He was amazed by how steady his voice was. He had known that Azkaban was a terrible place, but this...

""Black,"" Alastor snapped. ""We're here to talk to you.""

Sirius' eyes finally left Remus'. ""Moody. Nice eye. Eyepatch might have been less traumatic for the kids, y'know. You'd have made an awesome pirate too.""

Despite himself, the corner of Remus' mouth twitched before he quickly suppressed it. It had been a long time. Alastor just grunted.

""Enough chatter. We're here to talk about you.""

The awful smile widened. ""You know everything about me. Sirius Black, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, the man who couldn't protect his brother, and who got his best friends killed, and who couldn't avenge them-""

""Black!"" Alastor snapped, cutting off the increasingly hysterical ranting, but Remus' mind had already locked on his words.

""Avenge them? How could you avenge them, you betrayed them!""

Sirius moved faster than Remus had thought possible. He lunged forward to seize the cell bars. ""I never betrayed them! I would have died before betraying them! I failed and I got them killed but I never betrayed them!""

""You're not making any sense!"" Remus snarled. ""You were the Secret-Keeper! You were the only one who could have told Voldemort-""

""I wasn't the Secret-Keeper!""

Remus jerked back. ""W-what?""

Next to him, Alastor had gone very still. Sirius' eyes didn't leave Remus'. ""James asked me,"" he said, and his voice had fallen to a scratchy whisper. ""He trusted me. But I had to be clever, I thought it would be safer if they used someone they'd never suspect...""

Everything fell into place, and the wolf Patronus vanished at the same moment Remus' knees buckled. ""Peter. They...they used Peter.""

""Hold on,"" Alastor interrupted. ""How do we know you're telling the truth?""

Sirius let out a hollow laugh, so different from the joyful sound of their Hogwarts years. ""Look around. Being innocent is the only thing that's kept me sane. It's the only thing the Dementors can't take from me.""

Alastor's scowl deepened, but he said nothing. Remus stared from him to Black. ""Could that be true?""

Sirius did seem different from the other inmates. They were either talking nonsense, or barely conscious lumps. Sirius though... The obsession was there, but Sirius had always been intense, and after eight years with just one thing to focus on...

""Of course it's true!"" Sirius screamed. ""I would have died before betraying James! I would have died for any of you! But no one asked! They locked me up and let Peter get away with murdering all those people and no one ever cared about the truth because of course Sirius Black was evil and deranged like all the rest of his psycho family-""

""Wait,"" Remus interrupted. ""What do you mean no one asked?""

Next to him Alastor tensed, but Remus couldn't tear his eyes from Sirius'. Sirius, who had gone very still. ""No,"" he said, and this time his voice was very soft. ""No one asked.""

""But at the trial-""

""What trial?"" Sirius laughed again. ""That bastard Crouch found a Black and some dead bodies, that was all he needed.""

Remus had to lean against the wall to keep from collapsing. ""You...you didn't have a trial.""

How was that even possible? Yes, things had been chaotic after Voldemort's fall, but they weren't savages. Everyone was entitled to a trial. Bellatrix Lestrange and her accomplices had had a trial.

Then he realised that Alastor had yet to say a word, and whirled on the Auror.

""You knew.""

""Not until two days ago,"" sad Alastor quietly. Neither of his eyes were meeting Remus'. ""Things would be different if I had.""

""You were the most successful Auror in the country,"" Remus snarled. ""How could you not know?""

""Because I was either in St. Mungo's or on the streets,"" Alastor snapped. ""Along with all the others who actually did our jobs in that time."" He scrubbed a hand over his worn features, and when he looked back his eyes were flashing. ""We spent months tracking those bastards down, and we did our jobs right, damn it. Everything we had we handed over, then we went back and started after the next maniac. Everyone was supposed to get a trial!""

Remus glared at him, but there was no lie in Alastor's face. He remembered the chaos of those days and weeks; no one had known what had happened or what was going to happen next. It had taken months for everything to return to normal.

Maybe it wasn't so surprising that trials had been neglected, especially for such a seemingly clear-cut case as Sirius'.

Sirius gripped the bars, his burning gaze locking into Remus.

""I never betrayed them,"" he croaked. ""I would have died first.""

Sirius had never been able to lie to his friends. Remus looked at him, at the desperation in his face, and finally believed him.

But even as relief left his knees shaking, the revelation sent a spike of ice through his stomach. If Sirius had never been a Death Eater, if he had no knowledge of any plans they might have had in the event if Voldemort's defeat...

""Oh no.""

Sirius drew back, expression closing off, and Remus was quick to clarify. ""Not you! If you're innocent..."" He couldn't let himself think about that, and forged on, ""But you don't know anything about what the Death Eaters were doing? Or planning?""

""Of course not,"" Sirius insisted. ""How could I? And no one talks in here, they're all crazy."" His eyes bored into Remus'. ""Why? What's going on?""

Remus bit his lip hard enough to draw blood. He had no idea what telling Sirius about Harry might do, and then there was Alastor. Albus had clearly been trying to keep Harry's disappearance quiet, and it wasn't the kind of thing Alastor could or would keep from his superiors. Telling them would be a terrible mistake.

Harry was missing, and Remus didn't care.

""I hoped you might,"" he said quietly, ""because Harry is missing.""

""What?"" Alastor demanded.

""Missing?"" hissed Sirius at the same moment. His knuckles turned white on the bars. ""When? How? He was supposed to be safe, Hagrid promised me that he was going to his family-""

""He did,"" said Remus quickly. He ran a hand through his hair. ""He disappeared at the start of the summer.""

Alastor's magical eye was spinning fast enough to make Remus feel slightly queasy. ""And were only finding out now?"" he snarled. ""It's our job to find missing persons, especially if they're children. Does Albus know?"" He interrupted himself with a harsh laugh. ""Of course he does. Albus has to keep his secrets."" He turned away for a moment, and when he looked back both eyes fixed on Remus. ""You know I have to tell Scrimgeour about this.""

""I don't care,"" said Remus. ""I just want Harry found before anything happens.""

Alastor nodded shortly. ""We'll need to know everything you do. We'll keep it strictly need to know, the last thing we need is this getting out, but if Albus hasn't found him yet...""

He didn't need to finish the sentence. Remus nodded. He trusted the Headmaster with his life, but this visit had only confirmed that the old wizard wasn't perfect. He had made mistakes with Sirius, and Sirius had spent nearly a decade paying the price. They couldn't let anything happen to Harry.

Speaking of Sirius, he had been far too quiet since hearing about Harry, and that was never a good sound. Remus glanced round and found him staring straight ahead. His hands were still clenched around the bars, but his face held absolutely no expression.

The sight made Remus' stomach clench. Sirius was brilliant and passionate and a hundred other things, but never unemotional. Never like this.

""Sirius?""

Sirius didn't move. Remus took a step closer, and still not even a flicker.

""Black,"" Alastor barked. ""You in there?""

A low rattle of a breath escaped Sirius' lips. ""Harry's missing?""

Remus exchanged a look with Alastor, and saw his own wariness echoed in the Auror's scarred face. ""Albus thinks he's fine,"" he said. ""Just...lost.""

Sirius' jaw clenched until Remus could hear his teeth grinding, but he said nothing. Alastor folded his arms. ""We'll find him,"" he said gruffly. ""In the meantime, I'll talk to the boss and get a trial sorted.""

Something flickered in Sirius' eyes, something that made Remus stiffen. ""Sirius, we can't get you out without a trial. I'll keep looking for Harry, but you can't do anything until then."" He hesitated, asking Sirius to stay out of trouble was like asking the sun to stop, but it wasn't like Sirius could do anything. ""Don't panic,"" he settled on, finally. ""We'll get you out of here as soon as you can.""

Sirius nodded tightly, but otherwise didn't respond. Remus bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, and stepped up to the bars. ""I'll find Harry,"" he said fiercely. ""I swear it.""

The look in Sirius' eyes was really starting to scare him. Remus was just drawing in breath to try again when Alastor caught his shoulder.

""Think that's enough for one day,"" he said. Under the harsh tones was an unmistakeable undercurrent of concern. ""Being in here affects their ability to concentrate. Best leave him be.""

""Best to leave him with Dementors?"" Remus repeated.

Even with Alastor's Patronus, he could feel the foul things pressing at the edges of his mind. It had been hard enough to imagine Sirius in here when Remus was convinced he was a mass-murderer and traitor. Now it went against every fibre of his being to leave an innocent man here.

""I know, lad,"" Alastor growled. ""Believe me, I know. Which is why the sooner we get back and get things in motion the better."" His voice dropped further. ""And we need to start looking for Potter.""

Still Remus hesitated, torn between his loyalty his friend and to Harry, but before he could wrestle too much with the problem a harsh rattle interrupted him.

""Go, Moony,"" Sirius rasped. ""Find Harry. Find him. Find Harry, you hear me? Find him!""

""I will,"" Remus promised. ""I swear, I will.""

But Sirius barely seemed to hear him. He continued to thrash against the bars, his voice rising in a barely-human howl that made Remus flinch away. He didn't protest when Alastor nudged him back in the direction of the entrance, but his need to find Harry crystallised into something much fiercer.

He would find Harry. He would get Sirius out. Then there would be hell to pay.

For eight years, Sirius Black had been able to think of nothing but his own innocence. His own survival. It was the only thing he could do. The Dementors had sucked him dry of happy memories. All there was was the crushing knowledge that he had failed, that James and Lily had died because of his arrogance, that Peter had betrayed them...

But then Remus was there, and Moody, and they were talking about a trial but Sirius stopped caring about that the moment he mentioned Harry.

Harry was supposed to be with Petunia. Harry was supposed to be safe.

Harry wasn't with Petunia. Harry wasn't safe.

For the first time in eight years, Sirius Black focused on more than just survival. James had trusted him, and he had failed. He wouldn't fail again. Remus and Moody believed him, but Sirius knew better than anyone how useless the Ministry was. He couldn't rely on them. And no matter how hard he tried he couldn't remember if he had actually told them that Peter was still alive.

He would just have to take matters into his own hands.

Albus was seriously beginning to wonder if Hogwarts had gained a second poltergeist.

The explosion over the summer. The exorcism of Professor Binns. Now, he could add the destruction of the broom shed to his list. Once again there hadn't been the slightest tremor from the wards, and the perpetrator had left no clues as to their identity. Whoever was responsible for this was growing to be a serious threat to his school.

And yet...

No one had been harmed. Binns had left of his own volition. The fire that had consumed the broom shed had been set in the dead of night, and hadn't even scorched the grass. In both cases, things had actually turned to the students' benefit. Binns had been a loyal friend, but there was no denying that young Belinda was a far superior teacher. Students were even staying awake in class now. And Rolanda had been ecstatic over the opportunity to get the students decent brooms. Poppy had been equally delighted; the number of first years due to visiting the Hospital Wing due to accidents caused by faulty brooms had already dropped dramatically.

Albus removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. What they were dealing with wasn't a poltergeist. If anything it was the complete opposite. Something that was breaking both rules and laws with equal abandon, but always in ways that benefitted the students of Hogwarts.

After spending decades as a teacher, Albus had thought that nothing could surprise him. Hogwarts clearly loved proving him wrong. Fawkes let out a gentle trill, and Albus reached up to stroke his feathers. His friend dipped his head to nuzzle his cheek, and Albus let the song soothe his nerves.

""What are we going to do, Fawkes?""

Fawkes hummed again, and at the same moment the fireplace flared green. Albus rose to his feet, Fawkes hopping to his shoulder as he did so, and as he crossed the room Fudge's panicked voice rang through the room.

""Albus, are you there? I need you here as soon as possible! Something terrible has happened!""

""How did they turn only their skin pink?""

Cedric laughed. ""No idea, but I suspect it involved getting on the house elves' good side."" He shook his head. ""They'd better not make a habit of it, or Helga will kill them.""

Harry had to smile. As much as the twins' antics got on his nerves, he couldn't deny that they had a talent for pranks. ""I doubt she'll be too impressed,"" he agreed. ""She wasn't when I gave them that potion to make your hair stand on end.""

""I knew that was you!""

Dodging hexes was tricky when one was laughing their head off, but Harry managed. Cedric glowered at him. ""You're a menace. Still.""

'I am sorry to interrupt,' said Hogwarts gently. ""But something has happened.'

The laughter died immediately. ""What's wrong?"" Harry demanded. ""Is there danger?""

'No, or at least no immediate danger. The Headmaster has been summoned to the Ministry of Magic. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban.'

Harry frowned, but it was Cedric who voiced the question on both their minds. ""Who the hell is Sirius Black?""


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Cedric loved the ceiling of the Great Hall. It had taken the four of them nearly two years to perfect, but the effort was well worth it. Even now, centuries later, the magic blazed as brightly as it had when Hogwarts first opened, and Cedric could quite happily spend hours just watching the results of their hard work.

He was rather less happy to do so when he was desperately awaiting a letter, and the post was late. He had garnered a few curious looks from his friends over the course of the meal, but for once Cedric was too impatient to do more than nibble on an apple. He needed that letter. He had to know what was going on.

Someone clapped him on the shoulder, and Cedric's wand was in his hand before he knew what was happening.

""Woah, easy there! No enemies here!""

Cedric's cheeks burned, and he stuffed his wand back in his robes. ""Sorry,"" he said. He was on the verge of offering an excuse, but at that moment he happened to glance up and what came out his mouth was, ""Did the Weasley twins get you?""

The girl blinked, then burst out laughing. ""No, this is all me. I'm a Metamorphagus.""

Cedric watched in fascination as her hair cycled through a startling range of lengths and colours before finally returning to shoulder-length emerald green. She grinned and stuck out a hand. ""I'm Tonks.""

""Cedric,"" said Cedric, shaking it. The name rang a bell, and he placed it a moment later. ""Do you know Charlie Weasley?""

""Ever since first year,"" said Tonks, with a nod. She cocked her head to one side. ""Cedric...Yeah, he's mentioned you. Actually, I think I've heard Runcorn talking about you, and now I get why. Those are some good reflexes you've got.""

Cedric rubbed the back of his head. ""We can thank Fred and George for that.""

It wasn't a complete lie. The twins did provide a certain challenge. Tonks just snorted. ""Yeah, I can imagine. So what had you so distracted anyway? Everything okay?""

Cedric smiled. Tonks was far from the first older Hufflepuff to check in on the younger ones. ""I'm fine thanks, just waiting for a letter from my dad.""

Tonks nodded, her hair darkening slightly. ""If you say so. If you ever want to chat or anything, you know where to find me."" She grinned suddenly. ""And if you ever need a break, I do a mean Snape impression.""

""Pun intended?"" Cedric asked.

That earned him another explosive snort. ""Happy accident."" Her currently violet eyes flickered up, and she nudged him. ""And it looks like you're in luck.""

Cedric followed her gaze, and brightened at the sight of the owls soaring into the Great Hall. It was impossible to pick out a single owl among the hundreds of birds overhead, but a moment later Athena swooped down to land next to him. Cedric stroked her speckled plumage.

""Hi, girl,"" he said softly. ""Are you all right?""

He held up a piece of bacon, which she accepted with a grateful hoot. Tonks leaned forwards. ""She's beautiful. Is she yours or the family's?""

""Family,"" Cedric told her. ""We've had her for nearly three years now."" Athena hooted again and nibbled gently at his fingers before extending her leg to let Cedric untie the reassuringly thick letter. ""Thanks,"" he said. He passed her another piece of bacon, and gave her final scratch. ""Go and get a good rest.""

Athena needed no further encouragement. Cedric turned his attention to the letter, his heart racing at the sight of his father's elegant cursive. This might be exactly what they needed, and he had to show Harry as soon as possible. He shoved the letter into his pocket and swung his legs over the bench, only for Tonks to catch his arm.

""Hey, hold up,"" she said. ""What about breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day, you know.""

Cedric fought back the retort that sprang to his lips, and grabbed a piece of toast from the table. ""I know, but I have to check this. Thanks, Tonks.""

He was off and running before she had a chance to protest. A couple of his friends called out questions, but Cedric ignored them. He squeezed through the groups of students talking in the Entrance Hall, but before he could take refuge in one of the secret passages a lanky form planted itself in his path.

""There you are, Cedric. I've been looking for you.""

Cedric had to bite his cheek to keep from cursing. Percy pushed his glasses up his nose, his brow furrowing into a frown. ""Are you all right?""

""I'm fine, Percy,"" said Cedric quickly. He offered the older boy a smile. ""Just wanted to answer a letter before Transfiguration.""

Percy nodded, but his blue eyes didn't leave Cedric's and Cedric had to fight the urge to fidget. He knew how smart Percy was, and he also knew that he was far more perceptive than the twins gave him credit for. Cedric forced his best innocent look to his face.

""Is something wrong?""

""Why don't you tell me?"" said Percy.

Cedric bit his lip. He should have known that Fred and George would call in reinforcements. Percy sighed, and gestured for him to move over to the wall, away from curious ears. ""I know you're excited to be here,"" he said. ""And you've got your own friends, and you're doing your own thing, but Fred and George seem to think that you're trying to ignore them.""

""I'm not,"" Cedric insisted. ""Well, not really,"" he amended, when Percy raised an eyebrow at him. ""We just seem to keep missing each other.""

The lies sat uneasily on his lips, but there wasn't much he could do about it. It wasn't like he didn't want to spend time with his friends, but they were annoyingly sneaky and they knew him well. They would be able to tell he was hiding something, and then it would only be harder to spend time with Harry. After all the years apart, Cedric didn't want to risk that.

But he also couldn't keep avoiding Fred and George. His new friends deserved better than that.

""I'll try and catch up with them later,"" he said finally. He ran a hand through his hair, and offered Percy a sheepish smile. ""I guess I got a bit caught up in being here.""

Percy's somewhat severe expression softened. ""That's understandable. I was the same way when I first got here. And don't worry about Fred and George. They just miss you.""

Cedric could only nod. Percy clapped him on the shoulder. ""Well, good. And if you ever need anything, you know where I am."" He started to turn away, then paused. ""Oh, Cedric, you haven't seen Scabbers around, have you?""

""Scabbers?"" Cedric repeated. ""No, sorry. Has he gone missing?""

Percy nodded, his face falling. ""I'm afraid so. I haven't seen him since Monday.""

Cedric frowned. He knew the Weasleys' situation, and for all that Scabbers was just an old rat the whole family was very fond of him. ""I'll keep an eye out,"" he promised. ""I'm sure he'll turn up.""

""Thank you,"" said Percy, with a sigh. ""And you'll remember what I said, won't you?""

""Yes, Percy,"" said Cedric quietly.

""All right then. Now hurry up and see to that letter. You don't want to be late for McGonagall.""

Cedric gave an exaggerated shudder at the thought, and dashed off with the sound of Percy's laughter ringing in his ears.

Cedric's own spirits weren't quite as high. Maybe he had spent so much time trying not to neglect Harry that he had ended up neglecting his friends. It wasn't a feeling he liked. He would have to find a way to do better.

Cedric shook his head sharply. He could work things out with Fred and George later. Right now, he and Harry had other work to do.

His lungs were burning by the time he reached the seventh floor, but Cedric didn't care. He and Harry had done what investigating they could, but neither Hogwarts nor the ghosts had been unable to tell them much. Just the fact that Black had been best friends with James Potter had been enough to get them invested though, and Cedric had reached out to the best source he knew. Hopefully it would be enough to keep Harry from doing something rash.

For once the piles of rubbish were nowhere to be seen. Instead, there were the remains of several wooden training dummies, and a Harry that was unable to sit still.

""I tried to talking to Helena again, and Edmund,"" he said, as soon as Cedric entered, ""but they couldn't tell me much else."" He shook his head. ""This would be much easier if they weren't so isolated from even their own houses.""

Cedric grimaced, but he could see why the two ghosts would value their privacy so highly. He held up the letter. ""Hopefully we'll get something here.""

Harry brightened and shot to Cedric's side so they could read it together. He let out a low whistle at the multiple sheets that spilled out. ""How did they get all this information?""

""My dad hears everything,"" said Cedric, with a smirk. ""Everyone trusts Hufflepuffs."" Harry snorted, and Cedric continued, ""and he's been working there for years and knows where to get the best gossip.""

Harry grinned, but it quickly faded as he scanned the letter. ""They're reopening the case, they're advocating for a trial, and he still escaped? Why?""

Cedric shook his head. It didn't make much sense to him either. Harry swore under his breath in Arabic and started pacing.

""Do you think he did it?""

""Murder a dozen Muggles? No,"" said Cedric. He plucked the letter from Harry's hands, and glanced over it. ""And common consensus in the Ministry seems to be that it was this Pettigrew as well.""

That raised even more questions, considering Pettigrew had also been a friend, but Black was the priority and Cedric kept reading, ""Moody is the driving force behind the re-examination, and he's one of the best Aurora in the country, and the other friend, Lupin, is convinced that Black is innocent...""

His voice trailed off as he reached the last page of the letter, ice spiking through his stomach, but Harry was still preoccupied.

""Then why was he in Azkaban? With Dementors? I know things must have been chaos, but it's bad enough that criminals are sent there, let alone innocents! How was this not discovered sooner?""

Cedric said nothing. Harry spun back, eyes narrowing, and Cedric sighed.

""There's something else,"" he said quietly. He handed over the last page. Harry glanced at it, then the temperature in the room suddenly dropped. His hands clenched into fists, and Cedric rescued the letter before Harry crushed it.

Harry barely noticed. ""Godfather. He's my godfather.""

Cedric set the letter down, and wrapped Harry in a tight hug. He said nothing, but he could feel Harry trembling against him and ran a hand through his friend's messy hair.

""He was innocent,"" Harry hissed against his chest. ""He was innocent, and he spent eight years with Dementors, and no one cared. And I was stuck with..."" He trailed off with an incoherent snarl.

Cedric hugged him tighter. ""A lot of people care now,"" he murmured. ""Even if people are offended by his escape, he's already spent eight years in there for a crime he didn't commit. Of course if he handed himself in he could prove his innocence and be cleared faster, but-""

""But that would take time, and he's already spent years there,"" said Harry bitterly. He shifted, and when Cedric let him go he immediately started pacing again. ""How did this happen? We were both...None of this should have happened!""

Cedric said nothing. All the anger that had been building over Black's false imprisonment had doubled at the revelation that he was Harry's godfather. Harry could have had had a safe, happy childhood with someone who loved him. Instead they had both been alone.

Judging from the faint breeze tugging at his hair, Harry was all too aware of that. When he finally turned back, his green eyes were flashing. ""If I broke out of prison, the first thing I'd do would be to find someone who could help. Someone I trusted.""

Despite the situation, Cedric couldn't help a grin. ""If? That's exactly what you did do.""

Harry rolled his eyes, but a smile twitched his lips at the memory. ""And I was perfectly correct to do so, wasn't I?"" He shook his head, smile fading. ""The point is, if I were Sirius Black, and the one friend I had left had recently visited me in prison and believed my story, I know what I would do.""

""Agreed,"" said Cedric, with a nod. ""And it would be perfectly reasonable for you to write to a close friend of your parents asking for information about your newly-discovered godfather.""

Harry blinked. ""Write? Don't I need an address? I know nothing about Lupin.""

Cedric shook his head. ""I asked my Mum about it ages ago. They used to use loads of spells to make it easier for post birds to find recipients, and over time the magic just got bred into them. A name is all they need."" He crossed the room to clap Harry on the shoulder. ""And Hogwarts has a lot of owls for any student to use.""

It sounded like a perfect plan to him, but Harry hesitated. ""Wouldn't that be strange? For them to just hear from me out of the blue?""

""I suppose so,"" Cedric allowed. ""But do we have any better ideas?""

Harry scowled, But said nothing. Cedric glanced at his watch and winced. ""McGonagall's gonna kill me. Look, they won't be able to track you, especially not here. It might be worth a try. I've really got to run, but think about it, all right?""

""Fine,"" Harry muttered.

Cedric hesitated. Something was wrong here, but even as he opened his mouth Harry shook his head. ""I'll think about it. Now go on, before you're late.""

There was no arguing with that expression. Cedric gave him another quick hug, then ran for the door. He really hoped McGonagall was in a good mood. Between Harry, the twins, and Sirius Black Transfiguration was going to be a nightmare.

But despite himself, Cedric was in good spirits as he took the steps three at a time. Harry had a godfather. He had people that knew his father, and wanted the best for him. There was a chance for him to have a happy home, and if Black really was innocent then Cedric would do everything in his power to see them reunited.

They both deserved it.

Amelia Bones was one of the most formidable witches of her time. Albus had been aware if that ever since she passed every one of her first year exams with the highest marks seen in years. The rest of her time at Hogwarts, and her later career as an Auror and Head of the DMLE, had only cemented her reputation as a witch who was not to be crossed.

This wasn't the first time Albus had ended up in her bad books, but he had never seen her look quite this furious.

""July.""

Albus nodded. Amelia's lips were a thin line. ""A boy has been missing for five months,"" she said, and the ice in her voice made a winter at Hogwarts seem mild. ""Were you ever planning on informing us?""

Albus sighed. ""The particular circumstances-""

""Damn the circumstances,"" Amelia snapped. ""I don't care if it's the Boy Who Lived or the Queen of Sheba, if a child is missing you don't spend months trying to investigate discreetly at the cost of the child's safety!""

Albus opened his mouth, then closed it again. There was very little he could say to that. Scrimgeour pushed himself off from the wall and limped forward.

""Do you have any leads?""

His amber gaze was just as intense as Amelia's. Albus sighed. ""I'm afraid not. None of my suspects even knew Harry was missing.""

Scrimgeour exchanged a grim look with Amelia, but before either of them could say anything Alastor cleared his throat. ""And now Sirius Black does too.""

Albus closed his eyes for a moment. One more mistake to add to a lifetime of them. He looked up in time to see Scrimgeour scowl. ""Just what we needed,"" he muttered. ""But you can hardly blame the man.""

""Certainly not,"" said Albus quietly. Sirius would never abandon James' son, not even if the cost was his own freedom.

Amelia straightened, and all eyes returned to her. Her sharp gaze travelled round the room, before finally settling in Albus. ""We are going to find both of them,"" she said grimly. ""Potter and Black. And you, Albus, are going to tell us everything you know.""

Instincts born of a lifetime of discretion blazed up, but Albus forced them down. Harry was more important. Alastor grunted approval, but Scrimgeour quirked an eyebrow. ""And what are we going to tell the Minister?""

Alastor's face creased into a fierce scowl. ""We tell him and we tell Malfoy,"" he spat. ""And all the rest of his Death Eater chums.""

""We are fortunate that the information is currently contained,"" said Albus. If the revelation had been made anywhere other than Azkaban then they might have been in serious trouble, but as it was he was reasonably confident that they were the only people in the Ministry who knew that Harry Potter was missing.

Of course, that state of affairs was not going to last. Not with the sheer number of Death Eaters and sympathisers in the Ministry. All they could do was try to minimise the damage, and find Harry as soon as possible. Albus could only pray that they wouldn't be too late.

""That looks painful, Uncle.""

Harry spared his niece a small smile. ""I think I'd rather face a troll.""

One didn't have to talk to trolls. Honestly though, Harry would take anything over this. He had already spent most of the morning staring at the piece of blank parchment Cedric had left him, and he was still no closer to working out how to begin.

Helena floated down next to him.

""Would you like some help? I didn't really know any of them, but they were somewhat noticeable over the seven years they were here.""

She had told them as much earlier, and Harry certainly wasn't going to turn down any help. ""Thank you."" He sighed, twirling his quill between his fingers. ""I don't even know where to start.""

Helena raised an eyebrow. ""You could introduce yourself?""

Harry snorted. ""I wouldn't believe that.""

""You're the most paranoid person in history,"" said Helena dryly. She shifted so that she was sat perfectly poised in midair. ""I expect simply telling the truth about what living with your relatives was like would be sufficient. Lupin and Black must have met them at some point.""

Harry nodded, but didn't move. Helena cocked her head to one side, then her eyes suddenly widened. ""Uncle...""

""Never mind,"" Harry muttered.

It came out a little more curt than he had intended, but Helena didn't move. She started to reach for him, before breaking off with a frustrated huff and shaking her head.

""Uncle, those four were inseparable,"" she said gently. ""Black is your godfather. You know they would want to hear from you. No, they will be desperate to hear from you.""

Harry's throat was too tight to answer. Helena touched his arm, scowling when her hand passed straight through. ""Uncle...""

""The Dursleys hate me.""

The words stung, but Harry couldn't hide from them. They were his family, and they had never wanted him. Maybe it was irrational, but even the thought that his godfather might react the same way...

""Black won't,"" said Helena fiercely. ""He doesn't, and Lupin doesn't.""

""Helena-""

Then he broke off with a hiss as Helena shoved her whole hand through his chest. The icy cold left him gasping, and Helena glared at him.

""The Dursleys are nothing,"" she spat. ""Don't you dare try to deny yourself happiness because of them."" Her voice softened slightly. ""Please, Uncle. You know better than this.""

Harry stared at her, then at the quill he had crushed in his hand. She was right. Cedric was right. Black and Lupin had cared about his father. They had to care about him too.

He took a deep breath, and repaired the quill with a thought. He had to try. He dipped the tip in the ink, forced himself to ignore the way it was shaking, and started to write.

Remus sat in what passed for a park in central Birmingham. The moon hung in the night sky, close enough to full that Remus couldn't ignore the deep itch beneath his skin but he remained still. A few Muggle teens hovered by the entrance, but some primal instinct made them keep walking. Remus settled back against the bench and waited.

Hours passed. Remus burrowed deeper into his threadbare coat, but otherwise didn't move. If he had learned anything over the years it was patience. It wasn't the first night he had waited out here. If it wasn't the last, then so be it.

Then something moved in the shadows.

Remus rested his hand on his wand, but otherwise didn't move. The shape coalesced into an enormous black dog which padded forward and came to a stop just out of arm's reach. Clear grey eyes met Remus', and for the first time in a long time Remus let himself relax.

""You got my message then.""

The dog cocked his head to one side, tongue lolling out happily as he nudged Remus' knee with his nose. For a moment it was almost like they were teenagers again, and Remus was watching his friends mess around with their Animagus forms. He smiled, and pushed himself to his feet.

""My flat isn't far. We've got a lot to talk about.""

Sirius gambolled around like a puppy as they made their way through the silent streets. Remus couldn't blame him. He got restless enough if he stayed inside for a few days, let alone...

Remus shook himself. If he started thinking about what his friend had endured then he wouldn't get anything done. Sirius paused, ears twitching in his direction, and Remus forced a smile.

""It's nothing. Not far now.""

Sirius gave a soft huff, and stuck close to his side for the rest of the way.

It was late enough that even the student that lived above him were quiet. Remus locked the door, and by the time he turned back Sirius was standing in his human form. For a long moment they stared at each other, then Sirius gave a crooked smile.

""Good to see you without bars in the way, Moony.""

And in an instant it was like nothing had changed and Remus pulled his friend into a tight hug

Finally, Sirius drew back, and though he was smiling there was a fierce glint in his eye.

""Now,"" he said. ""How are we going to find Harry?""

Remus had expected nothing else, but he had to ask, ""Are you sure you don't want to prove your innocence first? If you turn yourself in now-""

""I'll spend weeks stuck in a holding cell while they re-examine all the evidence and argue about whose fault it is that I never got a trial before,"" Sirius interrupted. ""Hell no. They don't need me for that. Harry does.""

He looked at Remus although daring him to argue, but Remus just smiled. ""I couldn't agree more. Come on, I've got Firewhiskey waiting."" He paused. ""Perhaps a bath first though.""

Sirius barked a laugh, and Remus' smile widened as the world seemed to settle back into place. They would find Harry. Merlin help anyone who got in their way.

Thanks for reading! Any feedback would make an awesome birthday present! ;)

A stuffed head went flying through the air, and Cedric lowered his aching arms.

""All right,"" he gasped. ""That's enough for now.""

Harry nodded equally breathlessly, and set his own sword down to go and retrieve his knives. There was a deep scowl on his face. ""I am so out of shape.""

A house-elf appeared with a jug of water and glasses, and vanished before Cedric could do more than nod at them. He poured himself a drink, and handed another to Harry. ""You're nine,"" he said. ""No one's expecting you to be in shape.""

Harry's scowl deepened. Cedric couldn't exactly blame him. He used to be able to fight for hours, and now a short spar was enough to leave him out of breath. He put that thought from his mind with a shake of his head. Times had changed, and they were in perfectly adequate condition for their age. They had time to get stronger.

Harry still looked furious with himself, and Cedric bit back a sigh with an effort. Salazar had always expected too much of himself. This time though, Cedric suspected that more than his physical capabilities were bothering him.

""You'll hear from Remus soon.""

Harry went perfectly still. Cedric set his glass aside to squeeze his shoulder. ""You will,"" he repeated. ""They care about you.""

""You don't know that,"" Harry muttered, but he leaned into Cedric's touch. ""They might have more important things to worry about. Black has been in Azkaban for years, he's going to need a long time to recover, and they're good friends so he'll need Lupin to help him...""

""Harry,"" Cedric interrupted gently. ""Please. They will be glad to hear from you. I know it.""

Harry's face clearly betrayed his skepticism, but he said nothing. Cedric glanced at the clock and sighed. He would have to come back to this later. ""I'm sorry, but I need to go. I need to talk to the twins at breakfast.""

He had spent the night thinking about what Percy had said, and had come to the inescapable conclusion that the older boy was right. Fred and George deserved an apology, if not an explanation. It wasn't their fault that Cedric was still working out how to balance his past and present lives.

Harry just nodded. ""It's about time."" He hesitated, eyes dropping to his knives with studied fascination. ""I promise I'll be better about it this time.""

Cedric crossed the distance in two quick strides and drew him into a hug. ""We'll both be better,"" he corrected.

Harry didn't even pretend to fight against his grip. Cedric took a deep breath, letting his friend's presence soothe his nerves, and finally straightened. Before he could move away though, Harry caught his shoulder.

""Fred and George will understand,"" he said softly. ""They've known you for years. You'd have to do more than avoid them for a few weeks for anyone to give up on you.""

Warmth flooded Cedric's chest. He didn't have the words, but Harry's face twitched into the soft, genuine smile that only a few ever had the privilege of seeing, and Cedric knew he understood. Harry nudged him. ""Go on. You're supposed to be the brave one here.""

""Thanks,"" said Cedric dryly. ""I'll see you later.""

""This evening,"" Harry clarified. ""You need to spend lunch with people your own age."" His green eyes glinted mischievously. ""All you old people need to stick together.""

""Cheeky sod,"" said Cedric, through a laugh.

He was still smiling when he entered the Great Hall. For all that Godric had made it his mission to keep Salazar from the darkness, Salazar had been just as determined to look after Godric. It was good to know that nothing had changed.

For now though, Cedric had other friendships to work on. He saw two heads of bright red hair bent together at the far end of the table, and redirected his steps. A couple of his Hufflepuff classmates called out greetings, but while Cedric waved back he kept on track. He could catch up with his housemates after he had fixed things with Fred and George.

George was the first to notice him, and nudged his twin, but neither said anything. Cedric came to a stop opposite them.

""Good morning.""

Fred scowled. ""Sorry, do we know you?""

That was fair enough. Cedric sighed. ""I'm sorry. Can we talk?""

The twins exchanged a look, then George's frown relaxed ever so slightly and he kicked the bench out. ""It's about time.""

It was more of an opening than Cedric had expected. He sat down, and took a deep breath. ""I'm sorry I've been so distant,"" he began, but that was as far as he got before a snort interrupted.

""You've not been distant,"" Fred snapped. ""You've been avoiding us.""

Cedric bit his lip. ""I had some stuff to deal with. Stuff I had to deal with on my own."" He looked down. ""I know I should have been more open about it, and avoiding you both wasn't the right way to deal with it-""

""Of course it wasn't,"" George interrupted. ""If you were having problems then we would have helped!""

Fred was nodding. ""You should have just talked to us.""

""I know,"" said Cedric. ""And next time I will.""

The twins exchanged one of their long, inscrutable looks, but just as Cedric was starting to get restless their faces split into identical grins. ""Okay then.""

Cedric blinked. ""I'm sorry?""

He was used to apologies being a lot more complicated than that. Rowena was prickly, Salazar could be an absolute nightmare, and even Helga knew how to hold a grudge. There was always a fair amount of debate required for anything beyond a minor dispute.

But maybe he shouldn't be surprised. They were talking about eleven year old Weasleys, Weasleys that Cedric had known for most of his life. Maybe things didn't always have to be complicated. Fred rolled his eyes.

""You were a git, you know it, you're not going to do it again, we're all good.""

""Anyway,"" said George. ""We've got bigger problems, and you're just the wizard we've been looking for.""

Cedric frowned at the pair of them. ""What's going on?""

The twins exchanged another look. Fred looked one way, George the other, then both of them leaned in towards Cedric, grins nowhere in sight. ""We need to do something about Snape,"" said Fred.

Cedric blinked, then nodded. ""He has been a bit harsh lately.""

The twins snorted, and Cedric grimaced at his own words. Harsh was the understatement of the century. Snape had always been unnecessarily sharp, but over the last week or so he had become downright brutal. Potions was becoming universally hated amongst the student population; Cedric's fellow Hufflepuffs dreaded Snape's classes, and he had heard even sixth and seventh year students stressing out about Potions in the Common Room.

""He made Alicia cry the other day,"" said George. There was no trace of his usual good humour to be seen in his face. He nodded down the table to where a group of first years were huddled over homework. ""She didn't do anything wrong, she was just smiling, and he went mental. It's not right.""

""Percy's complained to McGonagall,"" Fred growled. ""So did Charlie, and the other prefects, and no one's doing anything! So we're going to instead.""

Cedric sat back and looked at them. He recognised the set of their jaws, and the gleam in their eyes. They were going to do this with or without him.

Godric had spent his life fighting people who hurt others. Cedric couldn't do that yet, but he was very capable of helping his friends mess with a bully. He smiled at the twins.

""What did you have in mind?""

Harry didn't even try to stay in the Room of Requirement. He didn't have the fresh ingredients he needed to make really interesting potions, and digging through piles of rubbish wouldn't be enough to distract him. For a moment he considered taking one of the new school brooms for a test flight, but reluctantly dismissed that idea, at least until later that night.

Physical activity was good though. Cedric's words from the morning rang in Harry's ears as he slipped the best of the knives into his robes, but he squashed them down. He wasn't going to over-exert himself, but a change of scenery would do him good. Avoiding attention, and anything that wanted to eat him, while training would just make things more interesting.

Anything to stop himself from dwelling on the letter he had sent.

Getting out of the castle was insultingly easy. If not for his unique skill set, Harry would be seriously worried about their students. He was annoyed to find that the tunnel that came out closest to the Forbidden Forest had collapsed at some point in the last centuries, but at least it would give him and Godric something to do if they ever got bored. Not today though. Harry had a desperate need to throw sharp things around.

A Disillusionment spell got him safely to the forest, but Harry found himself pausing as he stepped beneath the trees. The forest had always been dangerous, they had placed it out of bounds for a reason, but now it felt different. There was a darkness here that he hadn't felt before. He reached for his wand, and grabbed a knife in his other hand. For a moment he reconsidered this plan, but stubbornness kept him in place. There was no concrete danger, and he could Apparate back to the castle whenever he wished.

Well, he had wished for a good distraction.

Mind made up, Harry started to make his way deeper into the forest. He kept his wand in his hand and his senses stretched as far as he could manage, but he found himself missing the further reach of the wards. They really had degenerated terribly over the years. As soon as he was stronger, and he had a properly matched wand, he was doing something about that.

Harry finally came to a halt in a small clearing about half an hour's walk from the castle. It was far enough that he shouldn't be disturbed by anyone from the castle, but not deep enough in for the Dark creatures Harry knew lurked in the forest to be disturbed by him. He swapped his wand for another knife, took a deep breath, and sprang into action.

Remus had always prided himself on the speed of his reading. He might not have had the raw genius of James and Sirius, but he had gone through books the way his friends went through Chocolate Frogs. By the time he got to seventh year Madame Pince had actually stopped glaring whenever he visited the library.

He had been staring at the letter in his hand for most of the morning.


Remus Lupin,



My name is Harry Potter. I've heard that you were friends with both my father and Sirius Black. Sirius Black, who I've just found out is my godfather.



If this is the case, then I want to know why he spent eight years in Azkaban for a crime that he may not have committed, leaving me stuck with my Muggle relatives.



I should say at this point that I am no longer living with the Dursleys. They didn't love, like, or want me, and so I left. You don't need to worry about me, I'm in a safe place, but I am not going back there. All I want now is to understand why all this happened.



I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this letter. I am not going back to the Dursleys.



Harry Potter


Remus didn't know what to think. He had spent so many weeks going out of his mind looking for Harry, spent so many sleepless nights imagining what could happen to a lost child, let alone the Boy Who Lived...

He was barely aware of the door being thrown open and slammed shut, but Sirius' strident tones were impossible to ignore.

""Hallo, Moony! I found these in the corner shop. Not Firewhiskey, of course, but it'll smooth the way-""

""Sirius!""

Remus didn't often raise his voice. There was a crash of cider bottles being dropped, and the alacrity with which Sirius appeared would have been gratifying on any other day. He appeared in the doorway a moment later, eyes flashing with worry in his gaunt face.

""Remus, what-""

""Read it,"" Remus growled.

He thrust the letter into Sirius' hands, and stalked to the window. He had to get control over his emotions. If he couldn't then Sirius...

""What the fuck?""

Remus' hands clenched on the windowsill. He could feel the wood splintering under his grip, but even over the blood pounding in his ears he could hear Sirius' voice growing louder and more strident.

""He left? He ran away? He's nine, where the fuck could he have gone? We have to find him Moony-""

""We're going to,"" Remus bit out, but Sirius was still in full swing.

""He says he's safe, but how can we know that?"" He was stalking up and down the room now, kicking aside any chairs unfortunate enough to be in his path. ""He must be somewhere in the magical world if he knows what's going on with me-""

""Except there's a serious problem with that,"" said Remus quietly. ""Harry doesn't know anything about magic.""

Petunia had admitted to keeping his heritage a secret from him. In any other circumstances Remus would have had something to say about that. Sirius spun back, eyes blazing, then his cheeks flushed as he understood.

""Why was he left with those bastards in the first place?""

""Someone,"" Remus bit out, ""thought it was a good idea."" He looked up, and from the way Sirius' eyes widened guessed that the wolf was showing. ""And there's only one person with that kind of faith in people.""

Sirius went perfectly still, and then it wasn't just Remus' magic filling the air. His hands clenched into fists. ""Dumbledore.""

It came out more as a growl than any human noise. Not that Remus was one to talk. He thought of Dumbledore leaving Harry alone with Petunia, a family who hated him so much that he had run away from home, and his vision went red. He doubled over, years of self-control warring with pure rage, and couldn't suppress an incoherent snarl.

""Remus?""

The back of the chair split under Remus' grip. Splinters dug into his fingers, and the sharp stinging was enough to break him from his haze. Anger wasn't doing them any good here.

""Sorry,"" he managed. ""I'm fine.""

""I'm not,"" Sirius shot back. ""What the hell was Dumbledore thinking?""

Hearing the Headmaster's name made Remus want to break another chair, but he forced the impulse down. ""We've got to stop this,"" he forced out. ""Getting angry isn't going to help Harry.""

Sirius' aura of murder faded slightly, but he was still fuming. ""I know, but how could he leave him with that old hag? No, fuck it, that's an insult to hags!"" He ran a hand through his shaggy hair. His cheeks were still flushed, but even as he looked down at the crumpled letter in his hand his scowl faltered.

""Fine. You're right. But they're going to pay for what they did. And someone's going to answer for Harry being there.""

Remus nodded curtly. He was hardly going to argue with that. Sirius took a deep breath, and smoothed the letter out.

""So if Harry doesn't know about magic, then how did he write this?""

There was a long silence. The air was still charged with magic and emotion and it was suffocating. Remus kept thinking about Harry, had to keep thinking about Harry to keep rage from overwhelming him, but that only led to more questions. He rubbed a shaking hand over his eyes.

""He could have found some of Lily's old things,"" he began, but Sirius was already shaking his head.

""You think Dursley would leave anything like that in the house? No, someone must have gotten to him.""

Remus eyed him. ""Sirius...""

""A Death Eater,"" Sirius growled. The crazed light was back in his eyes. ""One of those scumbags must have found out where he was staying, they got into his head, they took him-""

""Sirius,"" said Remus sharply. ""We don't know that.""

""What else could it be?""

""I don't know!""

That admission left the two of them staring at each other, until Remus finally looked away. ""He says that he's safe. And he wants to know the truth about you. I think that's a good sign.""

Sirius cocked his head to one side. ""Death Eaters would know that I wasn't one of them,"" he said. ""But they haven't told Harry. They must still be working on him.""

Remus raised his eyes to the ceiling. Azkaban had done nothing for his friend's ability to leap to conclusions. Or to think rationally. ""Why don't we assume, for now, that Harry is, as he has said, safe and well and not under Death Eater influence? I'm not saying we just leave it,"" he added, when Sirius opened his mouth, ""but we shouldn't jump to the worst conclusions with no evidence.""

Sirius snorted. ""Why not? Everyone else does."" He folded his arms, scowl deepening. ""So what do you propose we do?""

Remus gave him a grim smile. ""What do you think? We write back.""

It was only when he missed his target completely that Harry finally came to a halt. It was far sooner than he had planned, but he was shaking with exhaustion and he had to sit down before his knees buckled. Maybe he had pushed himself too far. Not that he would ever admit it to Cedric. He sagged back against a tree trunk, throat burning as he sucked in breath. Next time he would have to bring water. And think everything through a bit better.

Harry let his head fall back against the tree with a thud. Physical exhaustion lent a curious mental clarity. He didn't have the energy left to worry about what Lupin and Black thought of him. He had done what he could, just as he was doing everything he could to get into fighting shape. That would have to be enough.

Harry took a deep breath, and pushed himself to his feet. Everything ached, and his throat was dry and scratchy, but he felt better. He would be doing this again, albeit with a little more planning. Maybe he would bring Cedric with him too next time. His senses prickled, and Harry shivered. Bringing Cedric was sounding like an increasingly good idea. There was something in the forest, something Harry had never experienced before, and he didn't think he wanted to meet it alone.

That thought was enough to have Harry moving back towards the castle as fast as he could manage. He wasn't scared exactly, but he wasn't in any condition for a proper fight.

Fortunately, Harry arrived back at Hogwarts without further incident. Unfortunately, his journey to the kitchens was interrupted by a commotion in the Entrance Hall. Harry ducked into one of the secret passages to get a better viewpoint, wary of the number of students gathering, but the screeched insults that came to his ears froze him in place.

""-slimy Slytherin scum!""

Harry's heart dropped into his stomach, but the Slytherins were already on the offensive, ""Look at that, more Gryffindors who can't tell us apart.""

""What's to tell? You're all Muggle-born hating gits! Gonna join your dad in Azkaban, Travers?""

""Don't talk down to me you arrogant Mud-""

""Rictasempra!""

The slur was lost in a burst of forced laughter, and any further comment was drowned out by the sound of more hexes being thrown. Feeling sick to his stomach, Harry sagged against the wall.

He had known things at Hogwarts were bad. He had heard as much wandering the castle, and Godric had confirmed it, but to hear the hatred in the students' voices, their inability to see the other as anything more than a mortal enemy...

This wasn't what they had wanted. Hogwarts was a sanctuary, a family, somewhere people could come and be themselves and feel safe. This wasn't that. Hogwarts was divided, at war within itself, and if children couldn't contain their hatred then Harry dreaded to think of what the rest of the wizarding world must be like.

After a minute's stewing, Harry risked a glance out the passage. Teachers had arrived to break up the fight and the crowds were already dissipating, but one lingered. Cedric was staring after the two culprits as Flitwick led them away, and the expression on his face made him look far older than his years. One of his friends called and he turned away, determination smoothing into an age-appropriate grin, but Harry had seen it and his own resolve hardened.

They would fix this. They had to.

 

Cedric shook his head, and grabbed the scrap of parchment.

""No no, a potion wouldn't be any good. He's a Potions Master, if he's going to be on guard for anything it's that, and he'd probably be able to taste anything different straight away.""

George's eyebrows shot up. ""You think he can do that?""

Cedric, who had watched Salazar identify minuscule amounts of poison hidden in even the strongest wines, nodded. ""No point risking it, is there?""

""It would be a waste if he realised straight away,"" Fred agreed ruefully. ""Shame, we found some great stuff in Bill's old books.""

Cedric shook his head. For all that the twins didn't seem to give a toss about their classes they didn't express even the slightest uncertainty about attempting advanced level potions. He couldn't wait to introduce them to Harry properly.

""Keep those in reserve,"" he said. ""Snape isn't the only one we might need to go after.""

The confrontation he had witnessed in the Entrance Hall was still fresh in his mind. It was deplorable behaviour from all involved, and Cedric had a strong suspicion that more than a few students would need a little extra incentive to change their ways. At least they would be easier to get to than Snape.

In the meantime, Snape was still a problem. George scratched the back of his head with his quill.

""Getting to him at all is gonna be the tricky bit,"" he said. ""You know what he's like in class, he sees everything.""

Fred scowled. ""We're going to need a distraction. A big one.""

""That's easy enough,"" said Cedric. If nothing else he knew how to cause chaos. He could be sneaky when he needed to be, long association with Salazar had taught him that much, but big and loud was much more in character for an eleven year old. The twins were no slouch in that department either. ""We need to think of something to actually do.""

""Something embarrassing,"" said Fred fiercely. ""Something that'll make him feel as rubbish as he made Alicia feel.""

George was nodding. ""Something that will show everyone just what a colossal git he is.""

Inspiration struck. ""Why don't we do just that?""

The twins exchanged a long look, then cocked their heads in unison. ""'I am a colossal git',"" said Fred, rolling the words around in his mouth. ""That has a nice ring to it.""

""Not that everyone doesn't already know, but they should at least be able to see him coming,"" George agreed. ""Bit of colour would make a change.""

Fred had snatched the parchment back and was scribbling away. ""Can't forget the glitter. Wonder if we can add sound effects?""

Cedric had to laugh at the image. When it came to causing mischief, the twins were in a league of their own. ""I'll look into it. I know a few older students, and people will be less suspicious of me asking than you two.""

Fred and George snorted in unison. ""Yeah, make the most of that while you can,"" said Fred. ""They'll soon see your true colours.""

Cedric certainly hoped not, but he kept smiling. ""Dunno what you're talking about."" He glanced at his watch. ""Speaking of which, I should go. It's group study night with the sixth year prefects tonight, and I want to check some Transfiguration stuff with them.""

George raised an eyebrow. ""Would this be the third year Transfiguration that McGonagall gave you 'cause you'd finished everything else?""

""How-""

""We overheard her gloating about you in the staff room,"" said Fred, with a wicked grin. ""I reckon she's gonna propose soon.""

Cedric's cheeks burned, and he kicked at Fred's chair. ""Shut up. She's a good teacher.""

""Yeah, yeah, we know. Just saying, we're not the only ones who wish you were in Gryffindor.""

Cedric smiled. At times he missed his house, but every time he saw how surprised people were when they realised he was a Hufflepuff he knew he had made the right choice. He was where he was needed. He pushed himself up, and nodded to the twins.

""Well, I'm happy where I am. And I've got Tonks in my house, and if anyone knows how to really annoy Snape it'll be her.""

Both Fred and George lit up at the thought. Cedric started to leave, then paused. ""Has Percy found Scabbers yet, by the way?""

George shook his head, smile fading. ""No sign of him. It's really weird. He was fine last year, and first year.""

""Percy's pretty upset about it,"" said Fred. ""We've even stopped teasing him about it.""

Cedric sighed. ""Sorry to hear that. I'll keep an eye out.""

He might be just a rat, but Percy really cared about him, and the rest of the Weasleys would miss him too. It was a pity Hogwarts wasn't actually omniscient. They would just have to keep an eye out. Cedric shook himself, waved goodbye to his friends, and headed back out into the school.

Alastor had rolled his eyes so many times in the last hour that he was giving himself eye strain. For a wanted man, Black was doing a terrible job of staying out of sight. Alastor had arrived intending to quiz Lupin on Black's whereabouts, but after seeing the man stroll out of the door bold as brass he had decided a sharp warning was in order.

After all, not all Aurors would be content with a friendly chat with a wanted criminal.

If he was being honest with himself, Alastor would rather hand Black over to the Ministry himself. Enough evidence, and public outcry, had arisen to get him a trial, and Alastor was confident that Black would be acquitted.

But there was the matter of Harry Potter. If his disappearance was what had inspired Black's breakout, and Alastor couldn't think of anything else that would inspire such a reckless action, then his own freedom would be the last thing on Black's mind. Talking to him before contacting the Ministry was the least Alastor could do.

Off-tune whistling announced Black's return. Alastor checked the surroundings out of habit, but kept his normal eye focused on Black. The man still looked terrible, not that Alastor was really one to talk, but he had put on a little weight and his hair had been trimmed to fall about his shoulders. Living with Lupin had done some good, even if the two of them were still idiots.

Alastor gave them another couple of minutes to get comfortable, then stomped across the road. He released his wand from its holster and flicked it at the door, which promptly exploded inwards. Startled shouts met his ears, and he allowed himself a grin before raising his wand.

For all that neither of them had seen combat in years, Lupin and Black both reacted promptly. That wasn't good enough. Two Full-Body Bind curses hit their targets, two wands flew to Alastor's hand, and two bodies hit the floor with a crash. Alastor stomped over to glower down at them.

""Constant vigilance!""

If looks could kill, Black would have accomplished what many Death Eaters had tried and failed to do. Lupin looked equally outraged, but when Alastor relaxed the spell enough for them to speak he held his tongue.

""What the hell, Moody?"" Black demanded. ""Are you trying to kill us?""

""Try the opposite,"" Alastor growled. He released the pair of them with a wave of his hand and folded his arms. ""For an escaped convict, you're terrible fugitive.""

Black staggered to his feet. ""No wonder they call you Mad-Eye now,"" he growled. ""Don't you know how to knock?""

""Don't you know that wanted men don't go wandering around Birmingham?"" Alastor shot back. ""I thought you at least had more sense,"" he added, switching his glare to Lupin, who had the grace to look slightly abashed, but it was Black who snorted.

""Sit in a cell for eight years and then see how much you want to stay inside.""

Alastor rolled both eyes as far as they would go, which was considerable. Azkaban had done nothing for Black's self-control. Lupin somehow managed to stamp on his foot while maintaining an expression of perfect apologetic innocence.

""We will be more careful,"" he said, over Black's splutters.

""No one noticed,"" Black muttered. ""You're just paranoid.""

""It's not paranoia if it's justified,"" Alastor snapped. ""If I can notice, then Death Eaters can too, and they won't restrict themselves to Body-Bind Curses. You've got to get a grip.""

Black's eyes flashed, but a warning look from Lupin kept him quiet. Lupin turned back to Alastor. ""Can we assume, from the lack of any other Aurors, that you are not going to be turning us in?""

Black's hand twitched in the way that would have made any Auror jumpy, and Alastor tightened his grip on their wands. ""No,"" he said curtly. He hesitated, but he needed their assistance and he wasn't going to get that without some display of trust. He set the wands on the table, and nodded approvingly when both wizards summoned them without taking their eyes from him.

""Why not?"" Black asked. ""What do you want?""

""The same thing you do,"" said Alastor quietly.

He didn't need to say anything else. Both Lupin and Black tensed, and exchanged a series of increasingly complicated looks before Alastor snapped his fingers in front of them.

""Yes, I'm talking about Potter,"" he growled. ""Far as I can tell, he's the only reason you wouldn't wait for us to go through the proper channels.""

Black glared at him. ""Of course I couldn't wait, Harry's gone! He could be anywhere, anyone could have him-""

""Sirius,"" said Lupin. ""Stop it. We're going to find him.""

Alastor studied them. Black was beginning to look as crazed as he had in Azkaban. Lupin was steadier, but there was something in his eyes, a sharpness to his movements that made all of Alastor's instincts flare.

""You know something,"" he said.

Black flinched, but Lupin's eyes narrowed. Neither of them spoke, and Alastor's own irritation spiked. He folded his arms, and focused both eyes on the pair of them. ""You're both terrible at hiding things,"" he said flatly. ""Remember that there is a child's safety at stake, and tell me what you know.""

""And then you finish with a a flick to the side, like this.""

Aldane Summerby looked doubtful, but he watched Cedric's movements closely. The fireplace burst into flame, and Cedric let it burn for a minute before extinguishing it. ""Go on, give it a try.""

Al half-heartedly copied the action, and Cedric wasn't surprised when nothing happened. He nudged his friend. ""It's not gonna work if you give up before you start.""

""Easy for you to say,"" Al muttered. ""You're great at this. You're great at everything.""

Cedric bit his lip. He could hardly say that he had a full lifetime of experience behind him. He scratched his head. ""No I'm not, I just like Charms. You'll get it, I know you will. Just try it one more time.""

Al sighed, but raised his wand again. He opened his mouth, and Cedric quickly added, ""And this time, really believe you can do it. Think of the best fire you've ever seen, think of how it feels and smells, concentrate just on that, and then breathe it out.""

Al eyes him, then closed his eyes. He was silent for a moment, brow furrowed in concentration, and he took a deep breath. ""Incendio.""

Sparks shot from the tip of his wand, and flames burst into life. Cedric let out a delighted laugh and clapped him on the back. ""See? I knew you could do it!""

Al stared at the flames, then at Cedric, a brilliant smile spreading across his face. ""I did it.""

In the warmth of the fire and Al's achievement, Cedric let his worries about Harry and the twins and Snape fall away. This was the moment he had loved most when teaching, and he had missed it. ""That was great,"" he said. ""You just need to have more confidence in yourself.""

Al ducked his head. ""I guess so. Thanks, Ced."" He looked back at the fire, and shook his head. ""I can't wait to show this to my cousins. They don't start school 'til next year, and they're gonna be so jealous.""

Cedric laughed. ""Probably. Are you seeing them over the holidays then?""

""Yep,"" said Al, with a nod. ""We're all heading back to Trinidad for Christmas. It's going to be great, even if there's no snow there."" He glanced back at Cedric. ""What about you? Are you going home for Christmas?""

Cedric opened his mouth, then hesitated. As much as he wanted to see his family, leaving Hogwarts meant leaving Harry to yet another lonely Christmas. He couldn't do that, but his parents would want to see him, and he didn't have any good reasons to stay at Hogwarts...

""Cedric? Are you okay?""

Cedric shook himself, and summoned back his grin. ""Yeah, course. Just started thinking about Christmas dinners. I've missed Dad's cooking.""

Al hummed. ""Tell me about it. The house-elves are great, but I don't think they've ever heard of doubles."" At Cedric's confusion he waved a hand. ""I'll ask Mum to send some. And some chutney. Maybe some kachori too."" He turned mournful eyes on Cedric. ""It's been months. I miss home cooking.""

Cedric studied him. Al had always been quiet, but Cedric hadn't realised he was homesick. He should have known better. He had always been better at looking after his students before. Being distracted by Harry and the twins was no excuse.

""You'll be back in a couple of weeks,"" he said. ""Have you been writing to them?""

The flames were dying in the grate as Al shrugged. ""Yeah, but it's not the same. I just, I haven't been away from home for this long before.""

Cedric chewed on his lip for a moment, but before he could say anything Al shook his head. ""But I'll be seeing them soon, and it'll probably get better. Anyway, thanks for your help, Cedric.""

There was an uncomfortable feeling in Cedric's stomach as he watched watched Al gather up his books and vanish down the passage to the dormitories. He should be better than this. He was one of the Founders of Hogwarts, and being a student himself didn't mean he could ignore his responsibilities. He would have to do more.

""You did well there.""

Cedric looked up in time for Tonks to drop onto the sofa next to him. Her hair was bright turquoise today and tumbled down her back in messy curls. Cedric rubbed the back of his neck. ""I didn't really do anything.""

""Don't sell yourself short,"" said Tonks. ""Teaching is way harder than doing it yourself, and I've done enough tutoring to know that for certain."" She cocked her head to one side. ""You seem to have a knack for it though. Have you ever considered teaching?""

Cedric couldn't help smiling. ""A bit. It's really nice seeing other people get it.""

Tonks grinned back. ""I know what you mean. If I hadn't got the Herbology grades for the Aurors then I was thinking about it myself.""

""You're applying for the Aurors?""

Cedric didn't know why he was so surprised. Then again, the whole concept of having a branch of the government dedicated to defending people was still something of a novelty. He thought about it a bit more and nodded. ""Being a Metamorphagus won't hurt your chances.""

""Definitely not,"" Tonks agreed, and there was a flicker of approval in her voice s she looked at him. ""Most people have said I'm crazy for going for it.""

""Some people say the same thing about wanting to teach,"" said Cedric with a grin. He opened his mouth to start to lead into the spells he'd need to teach Snape, but then he caught a glimpse of the clock and had to abruptly change track. ""Um, I need to meet someone, but are you busy over the weekend? I've got a couple of questions about stuff.""

Tonks' eyebrows shot up. ""Have they given you third year work to do or something? 'Cause I can't imagine you needing help with anything below that.""

Cedric hesitated, but she was going to find out sooner or later. ""No, it's not for school. It's for a project. With Fred and George.""

Tonks' eyes lit up. ""Say no more. I've got a study group in the morning, but grab me after lunch on Saturday, okay?""

""Perfect. Thanks, Tonks.""

""Any time. Don't do anything I wouldn't do til then!""

Cedric laughed, and darted out of the Common Room before Gabriel Truman could notice him. It was technically before curfew, but the prefects were protective of the first years. He had to dodge a few more of them on the way to the seventh floor, but that was something he could do in his sleep.

It wasn't enough of a challenge to keep his mind from drifting. He had no idea what he was going to do about Harry over Christmas, he had Snape to deal with, he was still furious with himself for not noticing that Al was struggling, and they still hadn't heard anything from Lupin and Black...

Harry took one look at him and shook his head.

""What's the matter now?""

""Nothing,"" said Cedric automatically, then winced when Harry's eyes narrowed. ""Everything's fine, I promise.""

""If that's true, then you wouldn't look that stressed,"" Harry shot back. He set his book aside, and crossed the room to take Cedric's shoulders. ""Let me help.""

Godric had never been able to keep anything from Salazar. Nothing had changed. ""It's nothing important,"" he mumbled.

""If it's worrying you, then it's important.""

Cedric hesitated, but he knew better than to assume Harry would drop the subject. He settled on the first topic that came to mind. ""It's one of my housemates,"" he said. ""He's been getting really homesick.""

Harry cocked his head to one side. ""Understandable, but I don't see why-""

""I should have noticed, and helped him out!""

""You did notice,"" said Harry dryly.

""Only when he came out and told me!"" He broke away from Harry's grip and started pacing. ""What kind of teacher doesn't recognise when one of their students is that miserable?""

""The kind that is an eleven year old student himself.""

Cedric opened his mouth, but Harry didn't give him a chance to say anything, ""You're not a teacher, Cedric. You're not even an adult. You're a first year student, and you're already dealing with more than any of them realise.""

That was true, but it also didn't change anything. Once again though, Harry got there first, ""And if I'm not allowed to take responsibility for what Dark wizards have done in my name then you aren't allowed to take personal responsibility for every child in this school. At least not yet."" He caught Cedric's arm, green eyes softening. ""You're only a child yourself. You can't keep going like this.""

Cedric wanted to argue. He wasn't only a child, he was one of the reincarnated Founders of Hogwarts. He should be better than this.

And yet, Cedric couldn't deny that he was exhausted. Juggling his new life, Harry, and maintaining his secrets had been difficult. Adding anything else would be a lot. Godric had never been one to shy away from a challenge, but there was only so much one person could do, and no matter how much he knew there was a limit to what an eleven year body could handle.

Some of his thoughts must have shown on his face, for Harry gave him a small smile.

""We will make things better,"" he said. ""But we will do it together. I promise.""

Cedric said nothing, but allowed himself to be guided over to the sofa. ""All right. I'll try to remember. But there's something else I wanted to talk to you about.""

Harry nodded, then paused, eyes narrowing. ""Would this have anything to do with the fact that the holidays start in three weeks?""

""How did you-""

""You're not the only person I talk to, you know. I think Helena's learned the school sessions by now.""

Cedric snorted. ""I should think so."" He hesitated, amusement fading. ""Harry-""

""You need to go back to your parents.""

Cedric stared at him, but Harry met his gaze steadily. ""It's too early to make them suspicious. I can't go there, even under a false name it would make things complicated later on. I'll be fine, it's not like I've ever done much for Christmas.""

""We used to,"" said Cedric quietly. They hadn't had many traditions, but they were cherished ones and he had missed them.

Harry's smile faltered for a split-second before he shook his head. ""One day. When Helga and Rowena are here, and I've 'reappeared'. We can work something out then. For now...""

His words made sense, but Cedric hated it. Harry deserved a decent Christmas. There had to be something he could do...

""Anyway, I can give you your present before you go.""

Cedric blinked, then smiled. ""It won't be the same, but fine. But we will have a proper Christmas as soon as we can.""

Harry just leaned into him a little. Cedric wrapped an arm around him, his heart feeling slightly lighter. Salazar had always been good at putting things into perspective for him. He glanced round the room, lingering on the pile of things Harry had deemed useful. It was considerably larger than it had been that morning, and Cedric frowned at it.

""Nothing from Lupin then?""

Harry stiffened slightly, and he gave a half-hearted shrug. ""If I got a letter like that I'd want to think about it too.""

Cedric just hugged him tighter. Harry didn't make a single noise of protest. Knowing it was time to change the subject, Cedric settled on something a bit lighter.

""Snape is still being a pain in the neck. I've been talking with the twins, but if you've got any ideas...""

He refused to flinch when an unholy gleam lit Harry's eyes. Salazar had never tolerated cruelty to children, especially coming from someone who was supposed to be protecting them. That person also being the head of Slytherin only added fuel to the fire.

""I could fill his office with acid,"" Harry mused. ""Guaranteed to eat through his furnishings, and resist basic and advanced cleaning charms for at least a week. I can even make it smell like dragon dung.""

Cedric smothered a laugh with a cough. ""Just his office?""

""I'm not going to subject our students to that,"" said Harry indignantly. ""Leave his classroom out of whatever you're planning.""

""I don't know, a couple of days off from lessons won't do anyone any harm. Honestly, we could use a break.""

He meant it. Half his housemates were on the brink of a nervous collapse, and Snape's temper was only going to get worse after they started their campaign. A few days break would do everyone good. Harry hesitated, scowl slipping into understanding.

""I suppose some of it could get in the classroom,"" he said. ""But not while there are students there.""

Cedric just about resisted the urge to roll his eyes. ""Of course not.""

Harry nodded, and continued to mumble increasingly unpleasant potion effects under his breath. Cedric leaned back on the sofa. He might have unleashed a monster, but it was better than thinking about Lupin and Black.

Alastor hadn't moved since reading Harry's letter. Even his magical eye was fixed on the piece of parchment. He also hadn't said a word, and Remus' anxiety was rising with every passing minute.

He didn't know what he would do if Alastor decided to interfere. The old Auror was brilliant, and had already demonstrated the ability to withstand both Remus and Sirius. If he did decide to go to the Aurors, or Dumbledore, then their chances of stopping him were slim to none.

But that wouldn't stop them from trying. Harry had reached out to them, and only them, and Remus would die before betraying that trust. Sirius was a coiled spring next to him, his magic humming in the air, and Remus could smell his rising agitation. Alastor had fought alongside them during the war, had saved both their lives, but Harry was family. Harry came first.

Alastor huffed out a sigh, and Remus' grip tightened on his wand. The magical eye spun round to glare at them.

""You two don't do things by halves.""

Remus didn't move. Alastor's voice gave nothing away, and his scarred face was impossible to read. Sirius let out a low growl.

""Harry's in trouble, damn it!"" he snarled. ""Are you going to help us or go running back to Dumbledore?""

""Sirius,"" Remus hissed. There was nothing to be gained from antagonising an Auror. Both of Alastor's eyes were locked on Sirius now.

""Watch your mouth, lad,"" he growled. ""If I didn't care about the boy you'd be in front of Amelia Bones right now.""

Sirius' breath hitched, and Remus caught his arm before he could do something stupid. He ignored the betrayed look that earned him, and focused on Alastor. ""Does that mean you're not going to tell them?""

Alastor gave a low, rumbling sigh. ""I should. The more of us working on this, the better."" Sirius twitched, but Alastor silenced him with a scowl, ""And more of us will put Potter in danger. It's a miracle the news isn't out already.""

""What are you suggesting?"" said Remus quietly.

Alastor didn't reply straight away. His magical eye spun back to the letter in his hand. ""Do you think this is genuine?""

Remus' heart skipped a beat. ""I think so. Petunia... Well, I wouldn't blame him for running.""

""I still think it's a Death Eater trick,"" Sirius muttered.

""We've already talked about why that makes sense,"" Remus shot back, without looking at him. ""I think it's real,"" he continued, keeping his eyes on Alastor. ""I don't know where he is, or how he got away, but the only way we're going to find out is by making him trust us.""

""And you're not going to manage that with the Aurors involved,"" Alastor finished.

Remus just nodded. Sirius was still fuming next to him, but it was silent sulking and Remus would take it. Their immediate priority was keeping Harry's contact secret. They could argue about the rest later.

Finally, after several long minutes, Alastor shook his head.

""Albus isn't going to like it.""

""Serves him right,"" Sirius growled.

Alastor snorted, and refocused on Remus. ""Keep me informed. And be careful.""

Remus closed his eyes in relief. It wasn't much, but it was a start.

Harry stood at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. He had given in to the demands of the season and was wrapped in two of the warmest and least moth-eaten cloaks he could find in the Room, but the Scottish winds still left his teeth chattering. He took a moment to erase the last of the tracks he had left in the snow, squared his shoulders, and set off into the trees.

Ten minutes in, Harry suspected that he had made a mistake. The same feeling of menace that had dogged his earlier visit was back. All Harry's instincts urged him to turn back, to get to Cedric, to get somewhere safe, but the moment he thought of that the ever-burning resentment flared up brighter than ever.

Lupin and Black should have written back by now. It had been nearly two weeks. It didn't take that long to write one letter. Basic etiquette hadn't changed that much. They should have written back.

Part of Harry's mind, the part that his old masters had created and the Dursleys had nourished, asked why would they want to? They had their own lives, and Black certainly had his own problems. Harry knew Dementors, and he could hardly blame Black for not feeling able to deal with his dead friend's son.

He still could have written.

Harry kicked a frozen branch out of the way with a scowl. Stewing inside the castle had been unbearable, but the cold wasn't doing much for his mood either. What he really wanted to do was fly, but he would be far too conspicuous in the daylight. Exploring the forest, and trying to work out exactly what was wrong, was the next best option.

He hadn't told Cedric. They had planned to do this together. With the wards in the state they were, if there was something dangerous in the forest then they needed to identify and neutralise it as soon as possible, and considering neither of them were older than thirteen trying to do it alone would be completely stupid.

Harry wasn't stupid, but he did need to do something. If nothing else, a little reconnaissance couldn't hurt.

Snow crunched behind him and Harry spun round, wand raised, only to freeze in place.

""Peace, young one. We mean you no harm.""

Harry relaxed immediately, pocketing his wand and bowing low. ""Forgive me. I did not know that I was trespassing on your lands.""

The larger of the two centaurs snorted, one hoof pawing the ground, but the one who had spoken continued to watch him. Her grey eyes, the same shade as her hair, were completely unreadable. ""You should not be here.""

Her words resonated on so many levels that Harry had to take a moment to respond. ""I apologise. I...I felt something."" He shook his head. ""I will not trouble you again.""

""Good,"" the black-haired centaur rumbled, but the other held up a hand.

""Enough, Bane. There is more at stake here then some petty trespasses."" The corner of her mouth twitched. ""We have a distinguished visitor with us after all.""

Harry's heartrate tripled. ""I-I'm just a student,"" he began, but the words trailed off when the centaur raised an eyebrow.

""You are not.""

Harry swallowed. The centaurs of his time had always known far more than they should, and said even less. It seemed that nothing had changed. He knew better than to try to lie, and instead changed the subject, ""There is something else in here. I felt it. Do you know what it is?""

""That is none of your concern,"" Bane snapped. He drew closer to the female centaur. ""This is a waste of time.""

Harry tried not to bristle. ""I know there's something dangerous in here.""

""That is why they call it the Forbidden Forest, is it not?"" the female centaur murmured.

""That's not good enough,"" Harry insisted. ""I know I'm not the first student to find their way in here."" His hands clenched into fists. ""Hogwarts is supposed to be safe. Why hasn't anything been done about this?""

""As if they could,"" Bane muttered. He looked Harry up and down and snorted. ""And you came in here alone? Humans grow more arrogant every year.""

""No,"" said the other centaur, before Harry could respond. The odd glint, almost amusement, was back in her eyes. ""The outcome would be less than certain.""

Harry's stomach was bubbling with nerves. He swallowed hard, and the centaur took pity on him. ""No one should be in this forest alone, even one such as you.""

Harry nodded jerkily. All desire for a fight had fled. The centaur took a step forward and gave a slight bow.

""I am Aeldra. We will meet again, Harry Potter.""

Harry's jaw dropped, and by the time he recovered Aeldra and Bane had vanished back into the forest gloom.

For a minute, Harry could only stand there. He knew how powerful Divination was, one couldn't live with Rowena for decades and not know that, but it had been a long time since he had seen anything that precise. Knowing his name was one thing, knowing that he wasn't the apparently-normal student he appeared to be... They even seemed to know that he wasn't the only one.

Harry sucked in a shaky breath. The centaurs knew too much, but he also knew them. They had barely trusted humans in the past, and judging from Bane's hostility things had only gotten worse. They weren't going to tell anybody else. Not yet anyway.

Still, Cedric deserved to know. Harry turned on his heels and started making his way back towards the castle as fast as he could. Aeldra's words about the danger in the forest rang in his ears, and pushed him on. He had been right, there was danger here, more than there should be, but if Aeldra was right then he couldn't handle it alone. It stung, but he needed help.

Either that or wait until he was older and stronger, but that wasn't an option when there was a danger to their students so close at hand.

Harry shook his head. He was in danger of doing exactly what he had warned Cedric against, taking too much responsibility upon his own shoulders. For now, he would talk to Cedric about the centaurs, and they would work out what to do together.

Getting back into Hogwarts was easy. He scrambled out of the passage and dropped to the floor, but as he turned to make his way back up to the seventh floor a commotion around the corner made him pause. Unable to resist, he made his way down the corridor and peeked over the bannister. A gaggle of students were passing on the stairs below him, and he caught snatches of conversations.

""-you see him?""

""Hard to miss the sparkly pink robes!""

""And they sing!""

""I was there, he was right in the middle of screaming at this little Ravenclaw when it happened. You should have seen his face, it was awesome!""

Harry withdrew. Apparently the first part of the twins' assault had been a rousing success. Some of the amusement was a touch mean-spirited, but after everything Cedric had told him of Snape's teaching methods Harry couldn't bring himself to care. Someone who had spent years tormenting their students could deal with a bit of payback.

Of course, now that the first stage of the prank was in place, it was time for Harry to do his part. He turned back to the Room, a smirk spreading across his face. This was going to be fun.

It wasn't unusual for Severus Snape to be in a bad mood. It was far more unusual, in fact, to find him content with life in any way shape or form. Albus was used to that, and could even understand it to a certain degree. Unfortunately, recent circumstances had left his Potions Master in an even more destructive temper than usual. Albus had fielded complaints from prefects of all four houses, but by the time he found time to speak to Severus their students had taken matters into their own hands.

Albus knew better than to admit it to anybody, but the discordant screeching woven into the spellwork had been very neatly done. The whole ensemble was impressive, and certainly more creative than anything he had seen in some time. He suspected that some of their new arrivals had been involved. It had also proven surprisingly difficult to dispel, requiring not only Albus' input but that of Filius as well.

Needless to say, Severus had not been in the mood to appreciate their students' ingenuity. The chaos later discovered in his office had not helped. Nor had having to use Bubble-Head Charms until they were finally able to remove the worst of the mess.

Albus was expecting explosions as he entered the dungeons. At the very least there would be demands for expulsions, probably mixed in with a few demands to let Filch deal with the culprits as he saw fit. And Severus certainly was furious, Albus could see it in the flash of his black eyes and the bitter tang of magic in the air, but there was something in the way he stood that made Albus pause just inside the doorway.

""Severus? Is everything all right?""

The look Severus gave him could have melted a dragon's hide, and Albus quickly amended his statement, ""Besides the obvious?""

Severus' lip curled, but he jabbed a hand at the congealed mess. ""I have been analysing this...concoction.""

""Ah. And your conclusions?""

Severus didn't reply immediately. Instead he waved his wand and a small beaker floated across the room. Albus took it, and a closer examination confirmed his initial suspicions.

""This is liverwort. Not an ingredient usually found in these sorts of potions.""

""Precisely,"" Severus bit out. ""Liverwort hasn't been used like this for centuries, not since some North American species of hornwort were proven to have greater efficacy with far fewer complicating effects. I have never seen a potion of this composition.""

""And you would not have taught anyone to do so,"" said Albus quietly.

Severus jerked his head. There was a muscle twitching in his jaw, and for once Albus had to admit that his agitation was quite justified. None of their students could have made this. The only instructions Albus could think of that called for this type of liverwort were found in a book dating back to the 1200s that he had seen in Nicholas' collection. Even a particularly enterprising student would have difficulty accessing that.

""It is possible that some of them did extensive research,"" he began, but Severus interrupted with a snort.

""Headmaster, I am aware of the capabilities of every potions student in this school. While there are a select few that might have the forethought to use an uncommon catalyst, this potion is beyond anything that any of them could have accomplished."" Black eyes bored into Albus. ""And may I remind you that it is not the first time that magic beyond the capabilities of any student has been performed within these walls.""

The whole situation suddenly became far less amusing. Albus remembered the explosion of magic over the summer, the exorcism of Binns, the destruction of the broom shed, and took a deliberately slow breath.

""It does bear a certain resemblance to previous attempts,"" he said quietly.

The other incidents, bar the first, had seemed to benefit the students. Considering the foul mood Severus had been in, and the fact that this prank had both amused the students and granted them a brief reprieve, Albus was willing to concede that it may be the same culprit. The why, and more importantly the who, remained frustratingly elusive.

""What is going on, Headmaster?"" Severus demanded. ""Who is doing this?""

""I do not know,"" said Albus quietly. ""But it cannot continue.""

This person might be working on behalf of the students, but their actions were raising questions that Albus could not answer. The one thing he did know for certain was that they were powerful and intelligent and appeared to have free access to Hogwarts. They threatened the wellbeing of everyone in his school, and Albus could not stand by any longer.

Harry was bored. Brewing Snape's potion had been a good distraction, but with that done and the Forest currently out of bounds he was beginning to get restless. Cedric had had to skip their early morning training session thanks to a double-length Astronomy class, and Harry was still waiting for a chance to tell him about the meeting with Aeldra. He was not looking forward to it.

That left Harry with nothing to do except tidying, which he was running out of patience for, and he was getting incredibly fed up with the preponderance of Christmas decorations. He had no objections to the holiday in principle, but the festive atmosphere only served to remind him that he would be spending yet another Christmas alone. He had done his best to make light of it, not wanting to burden Cedric any more than he had, but he couldn't say he was looking forward to the coming two weeks.

It might have been different if Lupin and Black had replied, but he didn't let himself dwell on that.

""Knut for your thoughts, Uncle?""

Harry forced a smile. ""I'll spare you them, Helena. What did the students think of the pranks?""

Helena eyed him, but accepted the subject change with good grace. ""They loved it. Some are worried that Snape will get even worse in retribution. I doubt it though,"" she added quickly, when Harry frowned. ""The Headmaster usually steps in when he gets this many complaints, and enough prefects have spoken to him that he's aware of the matter.""

""Then he should have done something about it,"" Harry muttered.

Helena gave a slight shrug. ""Don't look at me, I agree with you. I've seen too many Ravenclaws dreading Potions lately. As far as I'm concerned, Snape deserved everything he got.""

Harry smiled, but the approval didn't do much do lift his mood. They were sequestered at the back of the library, away from prying eyes, and he plucked a book from the shelves at random. ""I hope he's learned his lesson.""

Helena said nothing, and instead continued to watch him. Harry attempted to focus on the book but couldn't get past the first few pages before his attention started drifting. He hated feeling this way.

""You know you didn't do anything wrong, don't you?""

Harry's head snapped up. Helena met his gaze steadily, and he had to clear his throat before he could reply, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Ghosts didn't need to sigh, but Helena did so anyway. ""I know you, Uncle, and I've looked after students here for nearly a thousand years. You are not the only one to wonder why a loved one never reached out.""

""Lupin and Black aren't loved ones,"" Harry snapped. ""I don't even know them.""

""But you could have,"" said Helena gently. ""And they could have been. And it's all right to be angry that they haven't tried.""

Harry's eyes burned. The words in front of him blurred, and he had to swallow down a lump in his throat before he could reply, ""They should have.""

""They should,"" Helena agreed. ""They still might.""

An icy hand touched his shoulder and it took all of Harry's willpower not to flinch. Helena floated closer to him. ""Don't give up yet, Uncle.""

Harry managed a weak smile, but let it fade quickly. At least he had Helena and Godric, and hopefully Helga and Rowena as well. He sighed and straightened up. In the meantime, dwelling on things that he couldn't change wouldn't help. He looked down at the book in his hands, and huffed.

""Please tell me there has been some improvements in literature over the past centuries.""

Helena rolled her eyes and drifted upwards. ""Try some Shakespeare. Not one of the tragedies, that's the last thing you need right now.""

Harry couldn't argue with that. He shoved his book back on the shelf, and pulled down one of the collections of sonnets at random. Helga had always enjoyed poetry. Helena nodded. ""That will do. Let me know what you think, I want to show them to Mother when...when she gets back.""

The hope in her voice was painful. Harry stared down at the book. ""Do you have any favourites?""

The poetry helped. So did the lack of people, thanks to the subtle repelling charm Harry had woven around their little corner. The peace did wonders for Harry's mood, and by the time it came for them to light the candles he was feeling far calmer.

That sense of calm was promptly shattered when Pento the house-elf appeared before them. A letter was in his hand, and Harry froze in the act of reaching for his wand. Pento offered it to him with a bow.

""For you, Master.""

It was several seconds before Harry could bring himself to take the envelope. It shook when he turned it over and he saw his name printed neatly on the front. He had to swallow before he could reply. ""Thank you, Pento.""

The house-elf bowed again and vanished with a faint crack. Harry stared at the letter. He knew who it was from. There weren't many options, and even fewer that Hogwarts would let reach him. What it contained though...

Helena touched his arm, and the cold was enough to bring him to his senses.

""I'll be in the Room.""

He Apparated before she could say anything.

Harry stumbled as he reappeared. The waves of emotion were physically painful, and even as he hunched over Hogwarts' consciousness wrapped around his in a wordless embrace. For a moment Harry allowed himself to bask in her comfort, but the letter was fairly burning in his hands and he had to pull himself away.

All he had to was open the letter. Once he did that then at least he would know, whatever Black and Lupin said. Even a rejection was better than not knowing. Harry could deal with rejection, but not knowing...Salazar had never been very good at that.

And yet his fingers wouldn't move.

Harry forced himself to take a deep, slow breath and then release it equally slowly. His fear was logical. These people were the most personal links he had to his father. As much as he hated to admit it, their opinion mattered. As long as he didn't open it, he didn't have to know that they didn't want him.

A hand rested on his shoulder and only knowing that there was only one person it could possibly be kept Harry from hexing them.

""You haven't opened it yet?""

The letter was still crumpled in his hand. Harry's eyes burned, and he turned to bury himself in Cedric's chest. Cedric's arms came around him immediately, and Harry closed his eyes.

""Did Helena tell you?""

""Actually, Hogwarts did,"" said Cedric. ""I said I wasn't feeling well, no one will notice."" His fingers brushed through Harry's hair. ""How long have you been sitting here?""

Harry managed an awkward shrug. Clearly too long if Cedric had had time to come all the way up here. Cedric sighed. ""You don't have to open it if you don't want to.""

Harry closed his eyes. Cedric's arms tightened around him, but he didn't say anything. For a moment Harry let himself wish that he could let go. Spare himself the pain of yet another rejection.

But Godric had rubbed off on him. Harry took a deep breath and drew back.

""Yes, I do.""

Cedric smiled. He guided them over to a low sofa, keeping one arm around Harry's shoulders the whole time. Harry smoothed out the letter with trembling hands. He allowed himself one more breath, then ripped the envelope open. Two different types of handwriting met his gaze, and he started to read.


Harry,



My name is Remus Lupin. I don't know how you were able to contact me, but I am so, so glad that you did. Your father was one of my dearest friends, and I miss him and your mother every day. 



You asked why you were left with the Dursleys. It's true that Sirius is your godfather, but he was framed by Peter Pettigrew for the murder of twelve Muggles and imprisoned in Azkaban. It was Peter who betrayed your parents to Voldemort. I only learned the truth when I went to ask him if he was responsible for your disappearance. He told me what happened then broke out to find you. He will be getting a trial to prove his innocence, but you are our priority.



I wish I could have taken you in myself, I wanted to more than anything, but I have a condition that renders me an unfit guardian in the eyes of the Ministry. I wish things were otherwise, I wish you had never had to live with those people, but you wouldn't be safe with me.



We are glad you are safe, and understand your caution, but can you tell us anything about where you are and who is looking after you? There are still Death Eaters out there who hate you for what you did to their master, and they will be keen to get revenge. They are everywhere, including the highest levels of the Ministry. Be very careful who you trust.



I'm so sorry for what has happened to you, Harry, but you are not alone. Please remember that. If you ever need us, send word and we will come as soon as we can.



Remus Lupin


Harry had to pause after finishing Lupin's part of the letter. They didn't hate him. They had been worried about him. They wanted him to be safe. Relief left him light-headed, and for a moment he could only sag against Cedric.

""See?"" said Cedric. ""How could anyone not want you?""

Harry shook his head. His vision blurred, and he had to blink several times before he could keep reading. Black's writing was sharper and more angry, and in several places his quill had nearly torn through the parchment.


I'm sorry, Harry, I'm so so sorry. It was my idea to make Peter the Secret-Keeper, I thought it would be the perfect diversion. Peter was weak and everyone knew James was my best friend, and I thought I was so clever but I was wrong. I got your parents killed, and I will never forgive myself.



I'm your godfather. I've been a terrible one so far, but if you ever need me I'll be there. And whatever happens, you will never go back to the Dursleys. I swear it. I know you don't trust me yet, but I will do whatever it takes. You're my godson. I promised Lily and James that I would take care of you, and I'm going to keep that promise.


Harry swallowed. The self-blame and loathing practically poured off the page. He only realised his hands were shaking when Cedric gripped them tight.

""Harry? Are you all right?""

Harry had to choke down the lump in his throat before he could speak, ""He spent eight years in Azkaban. Eight years surrounded by Dementors, believing that he caused the deaths of his best friends.""

Cedric flinched. ""I know.""

""How did this happen?""

Cedric was quiet for a minute. ""It appears this Pettigrew is more intelligent than anyone realised. And wizards...we do like easy solutions.""

Harry looked away. This never should have happened. Black should have had a trial, he should have been freed sooner, he should have been able to look after Harry...

But there was no changing the past. Black was free, the authorities were finally working on getting him a pardon, and Harry was out of the Dursleys' hands. They could only move forwards.

Harry read the letter again. Warmth bubbled up in his chest and he found himself smiling. Black and Lupin cared about him. They were worried about him. The relief was great enough that he could almost forgive them for taking so long to reply. He didn't fully trust them yet, certainly not enough to tell them where he was, but they were trying. It was a start.

Cedric nudged him, and Harry looked up to find a warm smile on his face.

""Feeling better?""

""What do you think?"" Harry muttered, but he relaxed into Cedric's side. Cedric wrapped an arm round his shoulders.

""They sound like good people.""

Harry just nodded. Cedric's grip tightened. ""You deserve that, Harry. More than anyone, you deserve it.""

Harry hesitated, but knew better than to argue. He had Cedric, one day he would have Helga and Rowena, and that was all he needed, but he wouldn't say no to Lupin and Black.

Maybe this would be the last Christmas he spent alone.

Many thanks to mystrangecollectionmaker for all their help with Cedric and his family.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""Are you sure you'll be all right?""

Normally Harry would have rolled his eyes. They had had this conversation far too many times over the last week. Today though, he could only shrug. Cedric ran a hand through his hair.

""It's not too late for me to stay-""

""No,"" Harry interrupted. ""You need to see your parents. I know you miss them, and they'll be missing you too."" He reached up to squeeze Cedric's shoulders. ""It's two weeks. I'll be fine. You go and enjoy yourself.""

Still Cedric hesitated. ""I'll write. And I'll work out a way to visit. I haven't tried Apparating that far, but I can do it in stages."" He nodded to himself. ""Yeah, I'll do that.""

Harry didn't even try to hide the warmth that flooded his body. He couldn't begrudge Cedric the time with his family, but it was good to know that he wouldn't be forgotten. Not that Cedric ever would. Cedric smiled at him, but it soon faded.

""You'll remember what we talked about, won't you?""

Harry sighed. ""I promise I won't go into the Forest.""

Cedric had not been pleased to hear about his adventures. Not because of the encounter with the centaurs, he had been surprised by the accuracy of their Divination but agreed that they wouldn't say anything about it, but he was concerned by the danger that Harry had felt and been warned about. He relaxed slightly at Harry's words.

""We will deal with it,"" he said. ""Together.""

Harry just nodded. He would keep himself busy somehow. Cedric studied him for a moment, then pulled him into a hug.

""It'll be okay,"" he whispered. ""I'll be back in two weeks.""

Harry hugged him back. Cedric was warm and solid in his arms, and Harry breathed in his familiar scent and blinked back his tears. It wouldn't be long. Cedric would write and he would visit and he would be back soon. Cedric's arms tightened around him, but he said nothing and after a long minute Harry pulled back.

""You should go. You'll miss the carriages.""

He was proud to hear that his voice didn't shake. Cedric ruffled his hair. ""Take care of yourself. Keep an eye on Helena and Edmund. You're not alone.""

Harry managed a weak smile. Cedric gave him a final fierce hug and slipped from the room. Harry sank onto the sofa with a sigh. It was going to be a long two weeks.

""Knut for your thoughts?""

Cedric tore his eyes from the rolling countryside. ""I'm sorry?""

Fred nudged his brother. ""Not sure they're worth a knut.""

""Sorry,"" Cedric repeated. He sat up straighter and forced Harry from his mind. ""What were you saying?""

George eyed him for a moment before shrugging. ""Not much. Just wondering if you were planning on gracing us with your presence over the holidays?""

Cedric felt his cheeks warm up. The twins had accepted his apology, but he wasn't expecting them to forget about it any time soon. In fairness, he hadn't been paying attention for most of the journey home.

""Don't worry,"" Fred added. ""We'll stop Ron from pestering you.""

Cedric frowned at them. ""Ron doesn't pester me. And he's the only one of you who can give me a decent chess game, so don't you dare say anything to him.""

The twins rolled their eyes, but Cedric meant it. Ron was a good lad, with an mind for chess that was really remarkable in a boy of nine, and Cedric didn't like how Fred and George could get with him. He scowled at the pair of them until George raised his hands.

""Fine. It'll stop him bothering us anyway.""

Fred said nothing, but there was a glint in his eye that Cedric didn't like the look of. Making a silent promise to keep an eye on Ron over the holiday, he changed the subject.

""Reckon Charlie will be up for a pick-up Quidditch game over the holiday?""

""Definitely,"" said George. ""He says everyone's given him an insane amount of homework because of the NEWTs, but that just means he'll want to get outside more.""

Cedric laughed. Charlie was a good student, but there was a reason he was Quidditch Captain and not a Prefect.

The rest of the journey passed in a blur of jokes and laughter. Some of Cedric's friends from Hufflepuff stopped by, and Fred and George's friend Lee Jordan came by to hang out for a few hours. Cedric threw himself into the conversation and the experience of meeting new friends, but as hard as he tried he couldn't help worrying about Harry. By the time they reached London, he was more determined than ever to find a way to meet up with his friend over the holiday.

""Looks like Ron and Ginny came to meet us,"" said George. He jumped up to wave his siblings at the same moment Fred started to drag his trunk down. They collided with identical indignant squawks, and Cedric caught the trunk with a quick spell before it could squash Lee. Lee let out an explosive huff.

""Thanks, mate.""

Cedric waved off the thanks. Fred and George untangled themselves with sheepish looks and mumbled apologies, and George leaned out the window. ""Can you see your parents?""

Cedric took a quick look around him, then shook his head. ""Dad's probably at work, and Mum doesn't like crowds. She'll be over by the fireplaces.""

""I can see mine,"" Lee exclaimed. He squeezed his way past George to wave, and Cedric stepped back to give them more space. He had to smile at his friend's' excitement. He missed his own parents fiercely, having an adult's memories didn't change the fact that he had the physical body and brain of a child, but he had forgotten what it felt like to be away from family for the first time.

By the time the train finally came to a halt all four boys were ready and waiting by the doors. Cedric actually had to stop Fred from jumping out while they were still moving, something which earned him multiple eye rolls.

""You used to be fun,"" Fred grumbled, but the scowl vanished when two redheads bounded out of the crowd. ""Ginny! Ron!""

Cedric stepped aside to let the twins join their younger siblings. Ginny was picked up and spun around, squealing with laughter, while George grabbed Ron into a rough hug, all four talking at the tops of their voices. Lee grinned as he watched them.

""Wish I had siblings.""

Cedric thought of Harry and Helga and smiled. He nodded past the Weasleys. ""There's your dad.""

Lee was out the train before Cedric could even finish the sentence. Cedric cast a quick glance round, and seeing no one paying any attention to him levitated all four trunks out onto the platform with a silent spell. Being eleven and small and skinny again was a pain. He jumped out of the carriage and immediately felt a tug at his sleeve.

""Cedric, lift me!""

Cedric laughed, and swung Ginny up on to his back. Even as a weedy eleven year old he could manage that. She shrieked with glee, and he laughed. ""Miss me, Gin?""

""More than I missed those two,"" she said impishly, earning indignant snorts from the twins. Cedric grinned, then spotted Ron standing slightly shyly off to the side.

""Ron! Been practicing?""

Ron lit up at being noticed. ""Yeah, when I can! Can we play again soon?""

""I've been looking forward to it,"" said Cedric, and Ron's ears blazed bright red with pleasure. Cedric smiled at him. ""I haven't had a good match in weeks.""

None of his housemates were really into chess, and Harry had had other things on his mind. Ron beamed at him, thankfully not seeing Fred roll his eyes behind him, then further conversation was forestalled by the arrival of a redheaded hurricane.

""Ron! How many times have I told you not to run off? And you too, Ginny? I was worried sick! Oh, Fred, George, its so good to see you!""

The twins were pulled into hugs they didn't even try to escape from. Percy and Charlie had already been collected, and at Ginny's cry of delight Cedric let her down so that she could run to her other brothers. Ron, though, lingered.

""You'll come over next week, won't you?""

""Monday,"" Cedric promised. ""We'll have a game and then go flying.""

Ron gave him a brilliant smile, and Cedric couldn't help ruffling his hair. The youngest Weasley boy's lack of self-esteem reminded him horribly of Salazar sometimes. Unlike Salazar Ron didn't protest, just smiled even brighter before going to see his brothers. Cedric watched him go with a smile, then heard his name being called and turned to be enveloped in a fierce embrace.

""And Cedric, it's lovely to have you back. You've grown so much!""

""Thanks, Mrs Weasley,"" said Cedric. ""It's good to be back.""

Mrs Weasley patted him fondly on the cheek. ""And thank you for keeping an eye on these two. Merlin knows what kind of trouble they would have got into without you!""

Cedric grinned. The twins had been so busy investigating him that they had appeared almost well behaved this first term. That wouldn't last long. Fred caught his eye and snorted, quickly hiding it in a cough when Mrs Weasley glared round. ""What was that?""

""Nothing,"" said Cedric. ""There was a cold starting to go round last week.""

Fred and George grinned at him, and Mrs Weasley pursed her lips. ""Oh dear. I do hope neither of you come down with something. Pepper-Up Potions for all of you when we get home, I think.""

Her children exchanged looks, and Cedric decided it was time he excused himself. ""I should find my mum. Is it all right if I come over next week, Mrs Weasley?""

""Of course, dear! You know you never have to ask.""

""Lee's gonna visit sometime too,"" said George. ""This holiday is gonna be great!""

""Lee?"" said Mrs Weasley, and that was all she had to say before Fred and George were dragging her over to meet Lee and his dad. Cedric waved them goodbye, and Ginny ran over to hug him again.

""I saw your mum over there,"" she said, pointing in the direction of the Floo fireplaces.

""Thanks, Ginny,"" said Cedric. ""See you next week, everyone!""

He left with a chorus of farewells ringing in his ears. He weaved through the crowd, the charms he had placed on his trunk making it manageable even for him, and finally made his way over to the fireplaces.

""Mum! And Dad? I thought you had work?""

Dad laughed and caught him into a hug. ""As if I'd miss picking you up from your first term,"" he said.

Cedric grinned and hugged him tight, then shifted so that he could hug his mother too. Her hand came up to brush the back of his neck. ""It's so good to see you, bubbele.""

Cedric felt his cheeks heat up at the old endearment, but after so long away he just relaxed into her embrace. ""Its really good to see you too, Mum,"" he mumbled, into her shoulder, and felt her chuckle.

""My clever boy still needs me,"" she teased. She drew back to look at him, dark eyes studying him closely before she finally nodded. ""Hogwarts is treating you well.""

Dad clapped him on the back. ""It certainly is. He'll be as tall as me soon.""

Cedric couldn't help straightening, then blushed as his parents chuckled. Dad bent to pick up his trunk and blinked when he lifted it with no effort. ""Did you bring anything home with you?""

Cedric had meant to take the charms off before he got home, but seeing his father had distracted him. At least had learned enough from Salazar to be able to cover with a sheepish smile. ""I got one of the seventh years to charm it for me."" He grinned at them. ""Then I didn't tell Charlie and he nearly threw it across the hall when he picked it up.""

It had been a while since the older boy had looked that startled. His dad's loud guffaws drew startled looks, but Cedric was too busy soaking in his parents' presence to care. He had missed them. Mum wrapped an arm around him again.

""We'll get you home and catch up properly. I hope you didn't bring home too much washing.""

Ten minutes later found Cedric dumping his trunk in his room and bounding back downstairs. The whole house smelled like cholent, and it soothed the tension he hadn't realised he had been holding onto. Godric hadn't been particularly religious in his first life, and so growing up in a Jewish family, even one that followed Reform Judaism, had been something of a revelation. Going to Hogwarts and getting caught up in the chaos of the legacies of his life had left him neglecting the laws and traditions he followed now, and being back with his family brought home just how much he had missed it.

It wouldn't happen again, he vowed. For now, he would celebrate what left of Shabbat and be with his family and let himself be at peace.

Remus had been getting worried about Sirius. With no further information on where to start looking for Harry, and being restricted to the house thanks to his fugitive status and Moody's dire warnings about being more discreet, his friend had been growing steadily more agitated with every passing day.

Harry's second letter had only aimed that frenzied energy in another direction.

""Oh, and we have to tell him about the time Lily called out half the seventh year Ravenclaws for bullying that first year."" He sniggered at the memory. ""James was so starry-eyed he walked into a statue.""

Remus looked at the table. It was covered in half-written notes and discarded pieces of parchment. ""We're sending him a letter, not a book,"" he said. ""And I thought you were supposed to be writing a statement to give to Moody.""

The sooner the Ministry had some sort of statement about what had happened all those years ago the sooner they could get on with proving that Pettigrew had been the culprit. Moody had already found Sirius' wand somewhere in the depths of the Ministry and it was being tested, but Sirius' own account would help.

Sirius though, just glared at him.

""I don't give a damn about my innocence,"" he growled. He rummaged around in the chaos and shoved a piece of parchment against Remus' chest. ""Harry is more important.""

Remus didn't need to read the letter again. The words were burned into his brain. Harry had been understandably cautious, but one passage in particular had spoken of something deeper


Could you tell me about my parents? The Dursleys never talked about them.


Sirius' grey eyes were flashing with barely suppressed rage.

""He doesn't know anything. He doesn't know that James used to sing in the shower, or that Lily followed Muggle football from Hogwarts. He doesn't know that James asked her out fifty-seven times, or that he took her to that stupid tea shop for their first date and she hated it and he was convinced he had screwed everything up until she told him to stop being a prat and they went for ice cream instead. He doesn't know that James would do anything for his friends and Lily would never stay silent if she saw something wrong, and he has no idea how much they loved him.""

""Stop it,"" Remus whispered. His vision was blurring, and he had to take a moment to wipe away tears. Sirius suddenly paled.

""Fuck, does he even know that James was Tamil?""

Remus swallowed. Somehow he doubted that Petunia Dursley had ever bothered to think of James as anything more than that foreign boy. Vernon was no better. He had to swallow again before he could reply, ""Probably not.""

Sirius slammed a fist down on the table, sending parchment flying over the floor, but tears were gleaming in his own eyes. ""Fuck,"" he repeated. ""Fuck them, and fuck everyone who left him with them.""

Remus could feel the magic building in the room, not all of it from Sirius, and crossed the room to grip his friend's shoulder. ""We will tell him,"" he said fiercely. ""We'll teach him about his family and his heritage. We'll teach him everything James ever taught us. We will fix this.""

James had been fiercely proud of his heritage. They couldn't do anything about Harry's childhood, about how he had grown up knowing nothing about where his family came from, but they could change things now. Sirius rubbed a hand roughly across his eyes and sat up.

""You kept our notes from when James was teaching us Tamil?"" Remus nodded, and he gave a grim smile. ""That's a start. We'll work on it more when we can teach him in person.""

Remus glanced up at him. Did that mean... Sirius pulled a fresh roll of parchment towards himself. ""You come up with some more good stories, Remus. I've got a statement to write.""

Relief flooded Remus' body. He had always known Sirius would make an amazing godfather. This would be the last time Harry spent Christmas away from his family.

Then Remus sat bolt upright.

""Sirius. It's nearly Christmas.""

Sirius stilled, grey eyes going distant. ""Lily loved Christmas."" His grip tightened on the quill until Remus thought he would break it. ""He should be celebrating with us.""

""I know,"" said Remus. ""He deserves better."" Sirius frowned, and Remus let his grin appear. ""I think we can manage a bit more than just a few stories. Don't you?""

Cedric came down for breakfast refreshed and full of energy after a night spent in his own bed. He could hear his dad humming in the kitchen as he made scrambled eggs on toast, and when he poked his head into the living room he found his mother sat on the carpet surrounded by potions notes that would have turned Harry green with jealousy. It was a wonderful return to what passed for normality in their family.

Breakfast brought another surprise. Dad waited until they had finished eating before clearing his throat.

""Now, Cedric, I've got some exciting news.""

Cedric brightened. ""Did the Harpies qualify for Europe?""

""What? Oh yes, they passed with flying colours. Spectacular game actually, I've got the Prophet report somewhere-""

""Amos,"" said Mum gently. ""The other exciting news?""

Dad coughed. ""Ah, yes, of course. Thank you, dear.""

The look the two of them shared reminded Cedric far too much of how he used to look at Rowena. The resulting ache in his chest was far too familiar, and he leaned forward. ""Dad? What is it?""

Dad tore his eyes away to smile at him. ""Oh, yes. "" He puffed himself up. ""I've been promoted! You are looking at the Head of the Spirit Division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.""

""Congratulations!"" Cedric exclaimed. He stood up to give his father a hug. ""That's great!""

""Isn't it?"" said Dad proudly. ""And I already know what my first order of business will be."" He didn't wait for Cedric to voice the question. ""It's about time we found out what really happened to Professor Binns.""

Only decades of practice kept Cedric's grin on his face. ""Binns? I thought the Aurors already looked into that.""

Hogwarts had passed on the results of the investigation as soon as they made their report to Dumbledore, but neither Cedric nor Harry had been particularly worried. Harry's spell had been an old and highly effective one that left no traces. Dad frowned.

""They did, but to find no evidence whatsoever? It's a disgrace!"" He paused. ""Of course I'm sure that Rufus managed the whole affair correctly, but the Aurors don't have our specialist knowledge after all. I'm confident that we can find something they missed.""

Cedric rather doubted that, especially after two months, but he just shrugged. ""Okay, but they did say that Binns went voluntarily. Professor Bagshott is brilliant anyway.""

The young woman taught stuff that had happened in the last century for a start. Dad chuckled. ""I'm sure, but it's the principle of the thing. In fact, I was planning on having a word with Rufus at the works do.""

""Works do?""

It was Mum that answered, ""Amelia Bones is hosting this year's Ministry party. We have been invited.""

She didn't look too happy at the prospect, she liked large gatherings about as much as Harry did, but Dad was beaming at the perceived honour. ""It's about time! It'll be a fine evening."" He slung an arm around Cedric's shoulders. ""And I've told them all about you. Top of your year already! They're keen to meet you.""

Cedric nodded, then blinked. ""I'm invited?""

He couldn't imagine why anyone would want a bunch of children running around at a party, but Dad was nodding. ""It's tradition to bring children of a suitable age, or so I'm told. A chance for you to expand your horizons a bit.""

Cedric couldn't help the face he pulled. He loved meeting new people, but not like this. Dad was looking so proud though that he summoned a smile. ""Sounds like it'll be interesting.""

Dad beamed at him, and Cedric exchanged a resigned look with his mother as he was pulled into another hug. The things they did for family.

Harry stared out of the window at the stormy sky. The bad weather tugged at his magic, making him feel itchy and restless, and he tossed aside the battered cauldron he had been examining.

""No.""

Harry blinked up at his niece. ""You don't even know what I was going to say.""

Helena arched an elegant eyebrow. ""I know you, Uncle,"" she said, and her tone was scarily reminiscent of her mother. ""And I know you have more sense than to go flying in a storm.""

""I wouldn't get hurt,"" Harry muttered. Even without full control over his abilities, lightning had always been kind to him.

""No,"" Helena repeated. ""If Cedric gets back and you've flow into the Whomping Willow he'll murder me. And I've already been murdered once, and I doubt it will get any more pleasant with repeated experiences.""

Harry flinched, and she had the grace to look apologetic. ""Sorry. Force of habit.""

Harry managed a small smile. Thinking about his own murder was difficult, and he had only been aware of it for nine years. He couldn't imagine having a thousand years to dwell on it, but he could understand developing a somewhat dark sense of humour, if only to stay sane.

Instead, he focused on the less morbid part of her statement.

""What's the Whomping Willow?""

Helena waved a hand. ""I'll tell you about it in the morning. Not that I think you'd go out investigating it now...""

Harry felt his cheeks heat up and looked away. ""I promised Cedric I would stay out of trouble.""

Helena's expression spoke volumes. Harry scowled and slumped back into the sofa. ""I am, I'm just bored!""

Helena shook her head fondly. She floated down until she was closer to Harry's level. ""Remember how scared I used to be of storms?""

Harry blinked, then smiled at the memory. ""It's hard to forget. You always used to come to me.""

""You felt safe,"" said Helena softly. She met his gaze and smiled. ""You always did, but especially then.""

Harry's hand moved of its own accord before he realised he couldn't touch her. Helena reached for him at the same moment, and Harry couldn't quite suppress a hiss at the icy cold. For a moment he remembered how she used to scramble into his arms and throat her arms round his neck and it was a physical ache in his chest. Helena's own smile had turned bittersweet.

""Look how far we've come,"" she murmured.

Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. It did hurt, but he had Helena, even if it wasn't in a way either of them had ever thought possible. He looked back at his niece and smiled.

""Remember when Godric had too much of Hengist's ale and thought the thunder was a giant attacking?""

Helena snorted. ""Its hard to forget, he nearly blew the main doors off!"" She grinned. ""That was a good one. Though not as funny as the time the older students got hold of the really good stuff and threw a party.""

Harry groaned at the memory, but there was no heat in it. ""It was the first time I saw Rowena completely speechless.""

Helena laughed, bright and clear, and Harry smiled. There were worse ways to spend a holiday.

""Are you both ready to go?""

Cedric tore his gaze from the first flickering candle on the menorah and pushed himself to his feet. ""Have been for an hour,"" he called.

He tried to inject some enthusiasm into his voice, but knew he hadn't succeeded when his father sighed. ""I know this isn't how you wanted to spend the evening, Ced, but this is important to me.""

He slung an arm around Cedric's shoulders, and Cedric leaned into the embrace. ""Yeah, I know it is. I'll be more excited when I get there.""

""That's my boy."" He raised his voice. ""Naomi? Are you ready?""

""We don't have to leave for another ten minutes,"" Mum called down, and Cedric covered a smile with his hand. His mother had never been late for anything in her life. Dad sighed and brushed some fluff off of Cedric's dark blue dress robes.

""Am I being too eager?""

""Maybe just a little,"" said Cedric dryly. He glanced up at his dad. ""We are really proud of you, but you don't need to worry about impressing them. You're good at your job and that's what matters.""

Dad blinked, then smiled and patted him on the back. ""It's nice that you think so, but Ministry politics is a bit more complicated. You won't get anywhere in life if you don't play the game, my boy.""

Cedric suppressed a sigh with an effort. This was the most frustrating thing about being eleven again. Being considered mature for his age wasn't enough to get even his parents to take him seriously. About the only people older than him who didn't treat him like a little kid were Bill, Charlie, and Percy Weasley.

He closed his eyes and breathed out his annoyance. It wasn't just his dad that was the problem. The last thing he wanted to do was go to a boring party when there were so many better things he could be doing. In particular, he still hadn't been able to sneak away long enough to see Harry. He couldn't vanish for that long during the day without his mum getting suspicious, and she was good enough friends with the Weasleys and Lovegoods that he couldn't pretend to be seeing them. A party would have been the perfect opportunity.

""Ced?""

Cedric shook his head. ""Just thinking."" Maybe he would just pretend to sleep in in the morning and Apparate up to Hogwarts. It might end up taking two jumps, but he was pretty sure he could do it. He stepped away. ""I'll go and see how Mum's getting on.""

He took the stairs two at a time and nearly walked into his mum when she came out the bedroom.

""No running in the house,"" she said automatically, and Cedric gave her a sheepish smile.

""Sorry, Mum. You look great!""

She did, in traditional robes of a blue that matched Cedric's, and she straightened his outer robe with a smile. ""Thank you, and so do you."" She brushed a lock of hair back from his forehead. ""I know you don't want to do this,"" she said softly. ""But it does mean a lot to your father.""

Cedric leaned into the hug she offered. ""I know,"" he murmured. ""But I get to go flying all day tomorrow, right?""

She laughed and hugged him tight before letting him go. ""While it's light,"" she amended.

Cedric grinned. That was good enough. Mum tidied his hair one more time then sighed. ""All right, we should get going,"" she said. ""Don't worry, we won't be staying long.""

Cedric's grin widened. ""I can say I'm sick and need to go home whenever you want.""

Mum laughed and pushed him gently in the direction of the stairs. ""Come on.""

She hadn't actually said no, and Cedric was still grinning as he made his way downstairs. Dad was pacing back and forth in front of the fireplace and he brightened when he caught sight of them.

""You look lovely, darling. Now, are you both ready to go?""

""Yes, dear,"" said Mum patiently. ""As long as you're sure we won't be too early.""

""Of course not! Come on, I've already called ahead, and Madam Bones is expecting us.""

Mum quirked an eyebrow, and Cedric covered a smile with a hand. His dad was enthusiastic and passionate and that wasn't a bad thing, but he could get carried away. Dad clapped his hands. ""You first, dear?""

Mum sighed, but took a handful of Floo Powder and stepped into the flames with a grace that Cedric didn't have a chance of imitating. Dad waved him forward. ""You next, Ced. Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.""

Cedric smiled and stepped into the Floo. He still couldn't decide if it was more or less disorientating than Apparating, but at least it took less effort. He still staggered as he stepped out onto the carpet, but his mum was there to catch him and he gave her a grateful smile before straightening. The amount of magic in the house made his skin tingle, but he collected himself and turned to their hostess.

""Madam Bones. It's a pleasure to meet you.""

Madam Bones smiled down at him. ""And you. Your father has told me a great deal about you, Cedric.""

Cedric smiled, but before he could reply his father stepped smartly out of the fireplace. He straightened his robes and immediately held out a hand to Madam Bones.

""Madam Bones! Once again, thank you so much for inviting us. It really is a great honour.""

""It's a pleasure to have you, Amos,"" said Madam Bones. ""And you are right on time.""

Dad puffed himself up, but Cedric caught the glint of amusement in Madam Bones' eyes. Her long braids brushed against her robes as she turned to him. ""You are the first ones to arrive, but my niece, Susan, is upstairs.""

Cedric could take a hint, even if he would rather stay with the adults. He thanked Madam Bones, waved to his parents, and headed for the stairs. Somehow he wasn't at all surprised that they were the only ones there.

Cedric could feel the magic in the house as he made his way upstairs. The Bones were an old magical family and generations of witches and wizards had left an imprint that prickled at his skin. It seemed to get even stronger as he climbed the stairs, and without realising it Cedric quickened his pace. There was something here, something important, and he had to find out what. He moved along the corridor on silent feet until he came to the final room and opened the door.

He saw a girl around Harry's age, her yellow robes glowing against her dark skin, but all physical senses paled into insignificance next to the overwhelming rush of his magic meeting hers. Her eyes widened, at the same moment Cedric's jaw dropped.

""Helga?""

Thanks for reading! 

Also, I am not Jewish, Tamil, or Black, and while I'm trying to research as best I can I am going to make mistakes. Please do tell me when I do so that I can correct it, and any other feedback and advice would be very much appreciated.

Many thanks to TharAmira for their help with this chapter.

Cedric had spent years praying that his three dearest friends had been reincarnated alongside him. Finding Salazar in Hogwarts had given him hope, but still the fear of losing Rowena and Helga had lingered. More than one nightmare had featured a future without his two dear friends.

Now Helga was standing right in front of him and Cedric moved without thinking. He closed the gap between them in two long steps and pulled her into a fierce hug.

""Oh, Helga, I am so glad you're here.""

""Godric,"" Helga breathed, and her arms came around him in a crushing grip. ""I thought I was the only one.""

""Never,"" said Cedric. He drew back to look her in the eye, and had to swallow down a lump in his throat before he could continue. ""It is so, so good to see you again."" 

Helga beamed up at him, and her joy doubled his own. She was the warmth of the summer sun and flowers blooming in spring, and she was his little sister and he had missed her more than words could express. So much had changed; her deep brown skin and eyes were very different, and she was younger than she had been when they first met, but she was Helga and she was here and as her magic embraced him the world seemed brighter than it had in a long time. 

""I missed you,"" Helga whispered. ""I missed you so much.""

""Me too."" His face was already hurting from smiling so much, but he didn't care. ""How are you? Are you all right?""

If her life had been anything like Harry's... But Helga was already nodding. ""I'm fine. Better than fine, really. My parents and aunt... Growing up with magic has been very different."" Her smile faded slightly. ""I was just so scared that the rest of you hadn't been reborn too."" 

Cedric smiled. That was one worry he could do even more to alleviate. ""Well, I haven't found Rowena yet, but Salazar is here too.""

Helga's eyes went very wide. She turned away for a moment, and when she looked back her eyes were very bright. ""He's all right?""

Cedric pulled her into another, more gentle hug. He could understand the need to ask the question. ""As he ever is,"" he said dryly. ""He will be so glad to see you.""

Helga buried her face in his chest. ""I've missed him,"" she mumbled. ""All of you, but after we lost him...""

""I know.""

They should have had years more with Salazar. They had had another two decades with Rowena before she succumbed to illness. Salazar had been taken from them far too soon. Helga's grip tightened.

""He's not dying 'til he's at least a hundred and fifty this time.""

Cedric snorted. ""I'm glad you're here. We're going to need all the help we can get.""

Helga drew back, rubbing her eyes. ""At least it can't be any harder than last time. He doesn't have every Dark Wizard in the country after him this time.""

Cedric froze. ""Um. About that...""

Helga's eyes narrowed. ""He can't be in that much trouble. You're acting like he's Harry Potter or something.""

Cedric winced. Helga's laughter trailed off. ""Please tell me you're joking.""

Cedric shook his head. Helga sank into the nearest chair. ""Tell me everything.""

Cedric took a deep breath. He was very aware that they didn't have long before other children would be arriving, but a lot had happened in the last few months.

""Okay. Harry was sent to live with his aunt and uncle after his parents were murdered, they're massive racists and bigots so he ran away to Hogwarts last summer, I started my first year in September and met him there, he's fine, he's happy, we've been meeting up and training every day, we got rid of a terrible teacher and got a better one, we set fire to all the rubbish brooms so we could get decent ones, Harry's been exploring the Forest and there's something weird going on but it's okay I made him promise not to explore further until I got back so he can't have got into too much trouble-"" 

""Godric,"" Helga interrupted. ""Breathe!""

Cedric did, and gave her a sheepish smile. ""Right. Anyway, he's okay.""

""Good,"" said Helga quietly. She was quiet for a moment, then looked up at him. ""And how are you? Actually, who are you now?""

Cedric cast a quick glance out the door, but there were still no signs of anyone joining them. He turned back to her and stuck out his hand. ""Cedric Diggory. Nice to meet you.""

Helga shook it with a giggle. ""Susan Bones, and likewise."" She grinned at him. ""I'm a pureblood this time. It's so weird.""

""Same,"" said Cedric. ""Harry's a half-blood, I think."" He looked down, smile fading. ""I don't know about Rowena yet.""

Helga took his hand, and Cedric looked down into her dark eyes. She pulled him over to the sofa and snuggled into his side. Cedric wrapped his arm around her, relaxing automatically as he remembered all the times they had done this at Hogwarts.

""Rowena is here,"" said Helga quietly. ""And if the three of us are all around the same age then it stands to reason that she is too. She'll be at Hogwarts soon. I'm sure of it.""

Cedric pressed a kiss to her fluffy afro. ""I've missed you.""

""I've missed you too,"" said Helga. She grinned up at him. ""Though it's going to be strange calling you Cedric.""

""I still call Harry Salazar,"" Cedric admitted. ""It's fine as long as we don't do it in front of other people.""

Though he would have to make a conscious effort to start referring to her as Susan. Otherwise he would slip up, and it would probably be at the worst possible time. Susan nodded. ""Watch out for my aunt. She's really sharp.""

Cedric nodded. ""Got it."" He shook his head. ""It's hard though. A lot has changed.""

""Tell me about it,"" said Susan dryly. ""I'm a completely different ethnicity.""

Cedric grinned. ""I noticed. I'm Jewish. And Harry is Indian, we think. His aunt and uncle never answered his questions so he doesn't know for sure.""

Susan's smile faded. ""He deserved better than that."" She pulled away enough to look Cedric in the eye. ""So when are we going to visit him?""

Cedric blinked, then grinned. He didn't know why he was even surprised. ""I've actually got an idea about that."" A murmur of voices sounded from downstairs, and he frowned. ""But I don't think we have time to go into details now. I'll write to you in the morning, but trust me, it'll be fantastic.""

Susan eyed him. ""Oh? Have your plans improved in this life?""

But her eyes were sparkling again and Cedric relaxed. Footsteps sounded on the stairs and Susan detached herself with a grimace. ""If more people turn up we can sneak off,"" she whispered. ""Otherwise send an owl first thing in the morning.""

Cedric nodded, but couldn't reply before the door was flung open and two giggling girls came in. They broke off long enough to wave at Susan, who stepped forward with a smile.

""Hello! I didn't know you were coming."" She glanced at Cedric. ""Cedric Diggory, this is Alice Twycross and Marietta Edgecombe.""

Cedric summoned his best smile. ""It's a pleasure to meet you both.""

He was slightly bemused when that elicited more giggles. Cedric glanced at Susan, who just shook her, a slight smile playing about her lips. The curly-haired girl, Marietta, recovered first. ""Nice to meet you too, Cedric.""

Alice nodded, but didn't seem able to look him in the eye. Remembering his dad's words, Cedric tried again. ""Do you your parents work for the Ministry too?""

""My mum works in the Floo Department,"" said Marietta. ""So does Alice's uncle, but he knows more about Apparation. Right, Alice?""

She nudged her friend, but Alice just squeaked and continued to stare at the floor. Cedric nodded, trying to hide his confusion, but thankfully more children were arriving and Susan looped an arm through his.

""Come on, let me introduce you to people.""

""You've done this before?"" Cedric murmured. 

Susan nodded. ""Aunt Millie's been bringing me to these things for years. She says it's important to get to know people early."" She lowered her voice. ""Especially in the Ministry. She says it's much easier to predict people when you've known them as children.""

Cedric couldn't help laughing. ""I can't wait for her to meet Harry.""

""They're going to get along well,"" Susan agreed. She peered over the bannister and brightened. ""Okay, there's a lot of people down there. Come on, we'll go and hide in the guest room.""

""Why do I get the feeling you've done this before too? And what happened to introducing me to people?""

Susan arched an eyebrow at him. ""There will be plenty more Ministry parties, I can assure you. And only when I absolutely have to. Now hurry.""

Cedric cast a final glance down at the bustling hallway and followed Susan along the corridor to a closed door. Susan waved a hand at the lock, and slipped inside at the faint click. Cedric checked that no one was paying attention to them and followed her. ""This place is bigger than it looks from the outside, right?""

His dad had talked about doing it to their house, but had never got round to it. Susan nodded and dropped onto the bed. ""Yeah, it's been in the family for ages."" Her smile faded slightly. ""My other aunt and uncle used to live here, but they died during the first war.""

""I'm sorry,"" said Cedric quietly. HIs own family had come through the war mostly unscathed. Susan and Harry hadn't been so lucky, and who knew what had happened to Rowena. Susan tugged him down so she could lean against him. 

""I never met them,"" she said. ""But Dad and Aunt Millie have told me a lot about them.""

Cedric wrapped an arm around her. He didn't want to spoil the reunion with dark thoughts, but he couldn't help himself. ""We're not so sure that Voldemort is dead.""

There were a dozen better ways he could have brought that up, but the thought of facing another war was suddenly unbearable. They had just got another chance. Susan shivered. ""Some of the Aurors say the same thing,"" she said softly. ""We're going to have to do something about that.""

The steel in her voice was reassuringly familiar, and Cedric smiled. ""We will. We've got a lot of work to do.""

""Yes. And the first thing we need to do is make a plan."" She twisted to look up at him, dark eyes gleaming. ""When are we going to meet Harry?""

Cedric grinned. ""Don't worry. I've got an idea.""

Parties were exhausting, but Susan was awake before dawn the next day. Some habits took more than one lifetime to fade, and the events of the previous day, and the knowledge that she wasn't as alone as she had dreaded had left her too excited to stay in bed. She had a lot to do, and she set about getting ready for the day as quickly as she could. It would have been quicker with a wand, but the finesse with wandless magic that she had learned in her first life served her just as well in this one. That it made her parents so proud was just one more bonus.

Even after nine years, having her parents' approval sent a warm thrill through her. She had loved her first set of parents, and knew that they had loved her, but knowing that Charles and Elinor Bones loved every part of her was brought a sense of comfort she had thought lost a long time ago. 

The kettle whistled from the kitchen and Susan hurried to finish tying up her black hair. She ran down the stairs, and reached the kitchen just as her mother was pouring her first cup of tea. Mam looked up at her entrance and smiled.

""You're up early. Did you have a nice time last night?""

""I did,"" said Susan, with a smile and for once it was the truth. Seeing Cedric had been the best thing that happened to her all year. ""I made friends with Cedric.""

""Amos' son?"" Susan nodded. ""I'm glad. He seemed like a good boy.""

""He is."" She hopped onto a stool and accepted the orange juice her mother poured her with a smile. ""He's going to write and tell me about Hogwarts when he goes back.""

Mam blinked, then smiled. ""That's nice of him. And he's very good looking too.""

""Mam!""

Mam laughed, dark eyes sparkling as she sipped her tea. ""I know, I know. Studies first.""

Susan just shook her head. Cedric was the older brother she had never had and both of them were very happy with that. She refused to let herself think of the true object of her affections and leaned on the counter.

""I wish you didn't have to go in today.""

Her dad was working from home, but Christmas Eve was a time for family and it wasn't the same when one of them wasn't there. Mam smiled and cupped her cheek. ""Me too, but it's only for a half day. I just have to go over a few case details and then I'll be straight back home.""

It was the opening Susan had been hoping for, and she thought of Salazar and kept her voice light. ""Like Sirius Black's?"" 

Mam blinked. ""Well, technically he isn't one of mine, but under the circumstances..."" She shook her head, smile fading. ""Such a terrible thing to happen. Everyone has been keeping up with that one.""

""How did it happen?"" Susan asked. She needed answers, and she knew Harry would too. Despite just having woken up, Mam looked very tired.

""You have to understand, dear, things were very difficult at the end of the war. So many people were coming forward saying they had been under the Imperius Curse or otherwise coerced, others were trying to get revenge, and after everything we had lost...""

""I know,"" said Susan quietly. She had never got the chance to meet her uncle and his family. Many others had suffered even greater losses.

Mam sighed again. ""Mistakes were made. No one meant for it to happen, but it did and all we can do it try to fix it.""

Susan slipped off the stool and moved round to give her a hug. ""You will.""

It still filled her with awe that magical society had developed to the point of having a reasonably functional government, but this was a sobering reminder of how much further they still had to go. Mam hugged her tight, one hand resting on her curls. ""I hope so. Black finally sent in a personal statement, so Scrimgeour can put more pressure on the lawyers.""

Susan brightened. ""That's wonderful! Will that help them pardon him then?""

Mam thought for a moment, before slowly nodding. ""It won't hurt. It won't be long before it gets leaked to the Prophet, and Black already has a good deal of public support.""

""And Minister Fudge cares about what people think of him,"" said Susan slowly. ""He needs their support.""

Mam blinked at her. ""Yes. Yes, he does."" She ruffled Susan's hair. ""I didn't realise you paid so much attention to politics.""

Susan just shrugged. Like Cedric, she had had to get used to not being taken seriously. ""It's interesting. Sometimes,"" she amended. ""Not as interesting as your work though.""

Even if her mother's job was far more stressful. Helga had spent far too much time watching people she knew walk into danger without her. At least Aurors had had more in the way of back up than Godric and Salazar had managed with. Mam smiled, then glanced at the clock and winced.

""I'm going to be late. I'll see you later, sweetie.""

She gave Susan a quick kiss on the forehead and hurried for the fireplace. Susan sighed. She had a lot to think about, but the news about Sirius Black was promising. The sooner they could prove his innocence the sooner Harry could get an adult who wanted him. It would still take time, Sirius would need time to recover before he was fit to look after anyone, even if that someone was a reincarnated adult, but it was something. 

There was a soft tap on the window. Susan looked over to see an unfamiliar eagle owl, remembered Cedric's promise, and ran for the window. 

Harry had been hoping that Sirius and Remus would write back a little faster this time. He couldn't care less about Christmas and he wasn't expecting anything, but he really wanted to know about his parents. Helena and Edmund had told him what little they could, and there was only so much he could learn from seeing their names on trophies and class records. If Sirius and Remus were serious about wanting to be in his life he hoped that they would at least have a few stories.

He was not expecting Pinto to appear with an enormous hamper late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve. The house-elf bowed low.

""A gift, sir,"" he said, then vanished with a crack.

Helena leaned down. ""Are you going to open it, or keep gawping?""

Harry snapped his mouth shut. He set his book down and stumbled over to the delivery. ""What is all this?""

""If you hurry up and open it, we will find out.""

Harry rolled his eyes and unbuckled the strap. A heady smell of mixed sweet and savoury spices filled the room and he gasped. The Dursleys had never had anything more exotic than a curry from the takeaway found the corner. This was something else. He peered inside and blinked.

""How did they make it bigger on the inside?""

There was no way so much food should be able to fit in a hamper this size. Helena rolled her eyes. ""I'll show you the spell in the morning. Are you going to look at all this or not?""

Harry wrenched his attention from the new magic and focused on the contents. There were several boxes and wrapped packages, all smelling divine, but what caught his attention were the stack of notebooks. A thick album was tucked next to them and Harry reached for it with shaking hands. He opened it, and for the first time in his life his parents waved back.

Harry sat down hard on the floor, his vision blurring. These were his parents. His mother he had seen before in the Dursleys' old photographs, but these were so much more. Lily's vivacity blazed from every photo, and the joy in her eyes as she explored the world of magic reminded Harry so much of the young Muggleborns he used to know that he had to stop to wipe his eyes.

""She's beautiful,"" said Helena quietly. ""And she has kind eyes.""

Harry could only manage a nod. He rubbed his eyes again and focused on his father. James' skin was slightly darker than Harry's, but the thick black hair and the shape of his features were identical to his own. In most of the photos he was accompanied by his friends, or Lily, and Harry smiled at the love that poured from every image. 

How different his life would have been if they had survived.

Harry could quite happily have sat and stared at the photos for hours. There was so much he didn't know about his parents, and a quick glance through showed him that there were photos ranging from the start of their time at Hogwarts to their wedding, and even a few with Harry in, but the rest of the notebooks pulled him away. He reached for the top one, only to pause when Helena touched his arm.

""Harry. There's a letter.""

Harry grabbed it, and smiled at its thickness. He scanned the first page. ""It's full of stories about my parents,"" he whispered.

And not just that, he realised as he read further. The notebooks contained his father's scribblings about pranks, his mother's Potions and Charms theories, and everything that Remus and Sirius had been able to find about James' culture. Harry paused to find those ones, and a lump came to his throat as he found himself looking at his father's native language for the first time in his life. 

Helena, who had been reading over his shoulder, made a soft noise.

""I remember they all used to talk to each other in Tamil in their later years,"" she murmured. ""Nick always said it helped them get away with planning pranks in public.""

Harry's snort of laughter was more of a sob, but Helena didn't say anything. Another book was devoted to family recipes and descriptions of the sweets and snacks that Sirius and Remus had included, things like kozhukattai, murukku, cheedai, and pori, whose names Harry could barely pronounce but that were such an important part of his heritage that it made his chest ache.

""I never knew any of this,"" he whispered. ""How could I not know?""

If James had lived, Harry would have grown up with all of this. He would have grown up speaking Tamil and visiting India, and he would have been loved. Lily would have taught him Potions, and shown him how to love the Muggle world, not fear it. They would have been a family.

Voldemort taken that from them. Harry picked up the photo album again and turned to the very last page. His parents sat on the sofa, Harry asleep on James' chest while he and Lily held hands, and they were so young. They were twenty-one. They should have decades more, and Harry's smouldering anger crystallised into ice cold hatred. Maybe Voldemort was dead. Maybe he had already paid for the murders of Lily and James Potter.

But if he hadn't, if he did still live...

""Salazar.""

The concern in Helena's voice cut through the haze and Harry shook himself. ""Sorry,"" he muttered. He released his magic, and the wind that had been stirring died away. ""I just...Things should have been different.""

He set the notebooks back in the hamper without waiting for a response and turned back to the letter. The bunch of stories he set aside for later, but the last lines of the letter itself made him pause.


We hope you are safe, and somewhere you can enjoy the holiday. Don't hesitate for an instant if there is anything we can do you for you.



Happy Christmas, Harry



Remus and Sirius


Harry set the letter down in his lap. They hadn't asked anything else about where he was or who he was staying with, and their respect for his privacy made him feel cautiously optimistic. They had also given him far more than he had ever expected.

Maybe they had earned a little more trust.

Harry took a shaky breath. He had people who cared about him, and Sirius and Remus had given him the best Christmas present he had ever received. This holiday was rapidly turning into the best one that Harry had ever had. Not that that was a high bar admittedly, but it gave him hope. If he only had his friends, things would be perfect. 

Harry shook his head sharply. Perfect was out of his reach, but this was wonderful. He unpacked the parcels of food and laid them out on the table the Room had helpfully provided. He had no idea what anything was, but he was looking forward to finding out.

Christmas had always been Susan's favourite time of year, and so neither of her parents batted an eyelid when she retired to bed early on Christmas Eve. This time however, instead of getting ready for bed she gathered all her spare blanket and pillows and arranged them under her duvet until they formed a reasonable facsimile of a human body. Another blanket was scrunched up and placed on the pillow, and a burst of wandless Transfiguration turned it into a rough copy of her own head. It wouldn't fool anyone who came into the room, but she knew from experience that her parents wouldn't do more than glance in from the doorway to make sure she was still in bed. It would do.

There was nothing else to be done, but Susan found herself trembling. It had been so long. Nearly forty years had passed since she last saw Salazar. Forty years that they could have had together. Forty years where she had lived and Salazar had not.

Magic crackled in the air and Susan breathed it out. The glow faded from her skin, and Susan opened her eyes. The past was done. Salazar was alive and she was alive, and she would see him very soon. Her hands were still trembling, but she clenched them into fists and took a deep breath. She could do this. She focused her magic and vanished with a crack of Apparation.

Susan had been to Holgate Windmill many times, but this was the first time she had done so at night. Many of the other local landmarks would be too busy with Christmas celebrations at this time of year, but the windmill was closed and deserted, and slightly creepy if Susan was being honest with herself. She was only waiting a few minutes though before she felt a familiar prickle of magic. She flared her own magic, and a moment later a soft whisper came out of the gloom.

""Susan?""

""Here,"" Susan called back, then Cedric's pale face came into sight. He padded over to her, silent as ever on the damp grass, and took her hand.

""Any problems?""

""None,"" said Susan. ""You?""

Cedric shook his head. ""I'll never understand how Harry managed Surrey to Hogwarts in one jump. Devon to here was bad enough.""

Susan chuckled. Salazar had aways been the best of them when it came to Apparation. It was nice to know that that at least hadn't changed. ""Will you be all right to go straight to Hogwarts?""

York was closer than Devon, but it was still a good few hundred miles. Cedric though just grinned. ""It's for Harry. Of course I will."" He took her hand. ""You ready?""

Susan thought about Harry and Hogwarts and smiled. ""I've been ready for years.""

Cedric squeezed her hand, and the two of them willed themselves away. Susan felt the twisting distortion of Apparation give way to the warm embrace of magic, heard Hogwarts sing a joyful song of welcome, and then she was staring at a skinny boy with wild black hair and brilliant green eyes and fifty years worth of emotion exploded.

""Salazar!""

Harry froze in place for a long moment. His mouth opened and closed soundlessly, but Susan could feel the magic swirling around him. She took a step forward, and at the same moment Harry lurched up from the chair.

""I'm sorry,"" he whispered. ""I'm so sorry.""

Susan's vision blurred. She pulled him into a desperate hug, and felt his arms wrap around her hard enough to hurt. ""You died,"" she sobbed. ""Salazar...""

Further words were impossible. She clung to him while she wept for years lost and love left unsaid, and Harry trembled in her arms and his own tears soaked into her robes.

""I missed you,"" she managed. ""Every day.""

Harry's grip tightened. ""I missed you too. So much."" He drew back but didn't let go, and through her tears Susan saw a shaky smile touch his lips. ""But we're here now, and this time I'm not going anywhere. I promise.""

Salazar had only ever broken one promise to her and it was that one, but Susan didn't care. He was here now, and she would never let him go again. She pulled him into another hug, and relaxed further when Cedric's arms wrapped around the two of them. She had Godric and she had Salazar. This was the best Christmas she had ever had.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

It was a while before either Harry or Helga were capable of talking. Even Cedric's eyes were red from crying by the time they managed to pull themselves together. Harry felt wrung out and exhausted, but at the same time more full of hope than ever before. Helga was here. Everything was going to be all right.

Helga hadn't let go of his hand since they had reunited. Harry had no intention of changing that. They settled on the sofa, close enough that their arms and legs touched, and with Cedric on Helga's other side and Harry let himself bask in the presence of two of his dearest friends.

""I can't believe it,"" said Helga softly. ""All this time, and you've been here.""

Harry leaned into her. ""For the last six months anyway,"" he said. He looked down. ""Did...did Cedric tell you about my family?""

""They're not your family,"" said Helga, and Harry blinked at the steel in her voice. ""Family don't treat you that way."" She squeezed his hand. ""I'm sorry you had to go through that.""

Harry had to take a moment to swallow down the lump that came to his throat. ""It doesn't matter any more. I'm not going to see them ever again. I'm not going to have anything to do with them ever again.""

""Damn right,"" said Cedric softly. He reached around Helga's back to brush a hand through Harry's hair. ""And if anyone tried to make you, they'll have to go through us.""

Helga gave a slightly vicious grin. ""And my mother and aunt. Law enforcement takes a very dim view on child abuse.""

Harry made a soft noise of protest, and Helga frowned at him. ""It's true. You wouldn't call it anything else if it had happened to someone else.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. That was fair enough. He forced himself to let it go, then frowned. ""Your family are in law enforcement?""

""That's right. Mam's an Auror, and my Aunt Millie is the Head of the DMLE.""

It took a moment for Harry to place the name, and then he could only stare at her. ""Your aunt is Amelia Bones?""

""Yep,"" said Helga cheerfully. ""I'm Susan."" Her smile faded as she looked at him. ""So if I asked if you were all right would you give me an honest answer? Knowing that I could do something about it?""

Once again, Harry found himself lost for words. Susan met his gaze steadily, and her honest love and compassion left Harry breathless. He had missed her. He had missed her so much. He leaned into her, and took a deep breath.

""I'm better,"" he said. ""I'm safe here. I have Hogwarts, and the elves, and you. I-I just really don't want to go back to them.""

""Then you won't,"" said Susan, and though her voice was mild the steel in it was unmistakeable. Cedric hummed agreement, and Susan continued, ""I know no one can find you if you don't want them to, but if anything does happen then I'll talk to my family.""

Harry let out a long breath. ""Thank you.""

If he trusted anyone to keep him safe, it was the people in this room. Susan relaxed a little, and turned a warm smile on him. ""And hopefully it won't be too long before you have something more permanent anyway.""

Harry's heart leapt. Did that mean... 

Susan squeezed his hand. ""Mam says Sirius Black sent in a statement,"" she said. ""Scrimgeour has been putting pressure on the Minister. The public are getting more and more interested. Soon they'll be calling for a review of the case, and then everything will come out.""

""And they'll realise that Sirius is innocent,"" Cedric breathed. He bounced to his feet and started pacing. ""This is fantastic! With Harry's godfather a free man and willing to take him in, and Harry making his preferences known, they can't send him back to the Dursleys!""

Susan nodded, dark eyes shining, but Harry hesitated. He couldn't let himself hope. Not yet. ""He might not be able to take me in,"" he said slowly. ""He's been in Azkaban for years. He might not be ready for the responsibility.""

""Perhaps not,"" said Cedric. ""But we know how much he cares about you; we've seen his letters. He has Lupin too, and I know that they'll do whatever it takes to make sure that he's the guardian you deserve.""

He paused and crouched in front of Harry. ""They want you, Harry. They care about you. And I think you'll be happy with them."" His eyes softened. ""You deserve that, Harry.""

Harry drew in a shaky breath. He wanted to believe them. He wanted to trust Sirius and Remus. But trust had never come easily, and with his position so vulnerable he couldn't take risks. 

But...

Harry's eyes found the hamper they had sent, with all the letters and journals and more links to his family than he could ever have dreamed of. Sirius and Remus were trying. They hadn't let him down yet. He took a deep breath, and nodded.

""Maybe,"" he said quietly. ""I... We've still got time. I'll keep writing. I...I think they will too.""

Susan leaned into him, and Cedric nodded approvingly. He followed Harry's gaze. ""It looks like they're doing more than that. What's all this?""

Harry had to swallow down a lump before he could reply. ""They wanted me to know more about my parents. About my heritage."" He hesitated, but Susan's grip on his hand and Cedric's steady gaze leant strength. ""My father was Indian. Tamil.""

Cedric's face broke into a brilliant smile, but Susan was frowning. ""You didn't know before?""

Harry looked away. ""I knew I didn't look like anyone else in Little Whinging,"" he said, and he couldn't quite keep the bitterness from his voice. ""Petunia never told me anything.""

Susan squeezed his hand. ""I'm sorry you had to go through that."" Her smile was decidedly forced. ""I'm the only Black person in my primary school.""

Harry grimaced. It wasn't a feeling he would wish on anyone. He wrapped an arm round her, and Susan leaned gratefully into his support. Cedric's smile faded and he sat down by Susan again. ""I'm sorry,"" he said softly.

Susan shook her head. Her fluffy hair brushed against Harry's cheek as she turned to look up at him. ""I heard one of my great-uncles talking about the Potters. He was at Hogwarts when your grandfather moved back from India. Apparently their return caused quite the stir.""

Harry nodded, willingly seizing on the change of subject. He had only skimmed the journals detailing the Potter family history, but he could imagine that the return of an old pureblood family would have been noticed. Cedric snorted. 

""That must have been quite the dilemma for them. Old pureblood family with an excellent reputation, but Indian?""

His imitation of a pompous pureblood was perfect, and Harry had to laugh. Susan did too, but she sobered quickly. ""Especially a family with money."" She glanced at Harry. ""You do know your family had money, don't you?""

""I'd gathered as much,"" said Harry, with a nod. ""I haven't been able to access any of it yet. It's not a priority,"" he added, when both his friends frowned. ""I have everything I need here, even a wand. Which reminds me; Susan, you should see if there's one that works for you.""

Susan's eyebrows shot up. ""Who loses a wand?""

""That's exactly what we said,"" said Cedric dryly. He held up his two wands. ""I'm not complaining though.""

Susan shook her head, but didn't argue. Harry summoned the rest of the wands, and watched her look through them. She spent longer on the job than Cedric had; taking the time to examine the workmanship of each of the wands, and letting them speak to her magic. She had always had a better grasp of wandlore than he or Cedric had. Sparks danced along her dark skin as she waved one of the wands, and warmth spread through Harry's body. He was so glad she was back.

A nudge broke him from his thoughts, and Harry looked up to find Cedric watching him. His friend leaned in to him.

""I hope you're not going to waste this chance.""

Harry didn't bother denying it. He shook his head, and Cedric smiled. ""Good.""

His expression turned wistful as he looked back at Susan, and it was Harry's turn to nudge him. ""We will find Rowena.""

Cedric flinched. Harry sighed. ""We're here. She must be too.""

Nothing else made sense. Cedric gave him a small smile, then brightened as a shower of sparks burst from Susan's wand. ""What was that?""

Susan glanced back at them, a brilliant smile on her face. ""Pear wood,"" she said. ""And unicorn hair, I think."" She flicked the wand, and the mess on the table vanished. ""It's not perfect, but it will do.""

""It suits you,"" said Harry quietly. He recalled what little he'd managed to pick up of wandlore. ""A wand suited for the wise, generous, and  pure of heart.""

Susan gave him a shy smile as she stowed the wand away in her robes. ""You've been studying.""

Harry shrugged. ""I need to keep busy while Cedric's in classes, and there's only so much cleaning one can do in a day.""

Susan pulled a face in sympathy, but then brightened. ""Fortunately, my schedule is rather lighter.""

Harry's heart leapt. Cedric grinned. ""You sure you won't be missed?""

""I will be careful,"" said Susan, with a nod. ""I did learn plenty from the two of you, and my family trust me.""

As much as the thought of Susan visiting regularly filled Harry with dizzying delight, Harry found himself hesitating. They were only nine, and Apparating so far on a regular basis would take its toll. Eventually someone would notice.

""That's a long way,"" he said. ""I'm not saying don't,"" he added quickly, when Susan's jaw set in the way he was very familiar with, ""but we should think of some other way to communicate. It would help when you're away too,"" he said, glancing at Cedric.

Susan paused. ""That would be a good idea,"" she admitted. ""Something like our rings, perhaps?"" She grimaced. ""Though we were never were able to work out how to communicate in full sentences.""

""It's something we can work on,"" said Cedric. ""After all, we do have time on our hands. Classes aren't exactly taxing at the moment.""

Harry snorted. Susan grinned. ""My tutors think I'm a genius,"" she said. ""I can't really tell them that I'm over a hundred.""

Harry stared. He had had no idea that she had lived so long in her first life. Cedric rubbed the back of his neck. ""Yeah, I had the same thing. My teachers don't mind if I read ahead though, and Sprout mentioned finding more to do if I handled all that.""

Harry kept quiet. He didn't think it would help to mention that the Dursleys had paid no attention to his lessons, no matter what his teachers said. From the look his friends gave him they could guess the truth anyway, but both had the tact not to mention it. He rubbed the back of his neck, then his eyes fell on the hamper.

""I could ask Sirius and Remus,"" he said slowly. ""They mentioned that they and their friends were quite creative. They might have some ideas.""

""Good idea,"" said Cedric immediately. He patted Harry on the head. ""They'll appreciate you reaching out too.""

Harry ducked away with a scowl, but didn't bother trying to flatten his hair. Susan was openly grinning, and Harry let himself drink in the sight. He had missed her so much. Cedric looked between the two of them, his grey eyes fairly glowing with delight, then glanced at his watch.

""Look, I'd really love to stay, but I should get back home. Mum doesn't usually sleep through the night, and I don't want her to realise I'm gone."" He slung an arm around Harry's shoulders. ""But I'll be back before the holidays are over.""

Harry leaned into the comfort. ""Thank you.""

The words encompassed so much more than just that promise, and Cedric squeezed him tight in acknowledgement. He waved Susan over, and pulled her into the hug too. ""And I won't be forgetting you. Dad's delighted that we made friends, so I've got an excuse to write, and I bet I can work that into an invitation before the week is out.""

Susan laughed. ""I'm not taking that bet. Mam and Dad won't take much convincing, they want me to make more friends."" Her dark eyes sparkled as she looked at Harry. ""I don't think they were expecting Harry Potter though.""

Harry grinned. Cedric chuckled, and gave them both one final hug before reluctantly disentangling himself. ""I'll see you both soon. Harry, stay out of trouble.""

""Why aren't you telling Susan to stay out of trouble?"" Harry protested.

""Because I don't need to,"" Cedric pointed out.

Susan folded her arms. ""I could get into trouble if I wanted to. Have you seen how many new species of dragon they've discovered in the last thousand years?""

Cedric burst out laughing. ""Remind me to introduce you to Charlie Weasley,"" he said. ""He's mad about dragons. He's planning to go and work on one of the reserves when he finishes Hogwarts.""

Susan's eyes went very wide. Harry shook his head. Nearly being eaten by one dragon was quite enough for two lifetimes. Still smiling, Cedric clapped him on the back, and ruffled Susan's hair. ""Have fun you two!""

With that, he turned on his heel and Disapparated with a dull crack. Susan sighed and sat back on the couch.

""I've really missed this.""

Harry smiled at her. ""Me too.""

Susan's smile softened. Harry's heart lurched as he looked at her. Their eyes met, and Harry shifted his weight.

""Helga-""

""Salazar-""

They broke off at the same time. Harry felt his cheeks heat up, and Susan gave an awkward giggle. ""Sorry.""

""Me too,"" Harry mumbled.

There was an awkward pause as they looked at one another. Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again, and instead sat down on the edge of the sofa. This time he sat so that he could look at Susan, and she shifted too, pulling up her legs so she could curl up. 

Harry swallowed. There was so much he wanted to say. There was so much he needed to tell her, so much he never got a chance to tell her in their last lifetime. He couldn't let that again. Helga deserved better than that.

Salazar had been renowned for his silver tongue, but when it came to this? He didn't even know where to start.

But this was Helga. She deserved better. For her, he had to try.

""Salazar.""

Harry blinked up. Susan was still watching him. Her deep brown eyes, so different to the blue of her first life and yet filled with the same warmth and compassion, met his, and Harry's fear drained away. This was Helga. He trusted her with everything he was. There was nothing he couldn't say to her.

""Yes?""

""Are you...Is everything all right?""

Harry took a breath, and let it out very slowly. ""I...Yes. But there's something I need to tell you.""

He held out his hand, and was relieved when Susan took it without hesitation. She squeezed his fingers gently. ""You can tell me anything, Salazar,"" she said softly. ""Anything.""

Harry's throat was bone dry. His heart hammered against his ribcage as he swallowed, but Susan's eyes and grip were grounding and Harry drew on all the courage Godric had taught him.

""I... Before. I meant to tell you, but I never got the chance."" He paused, and had to swallow hard. ""I like to think I would have told you, if I'd had more time.""

""It's all right, Salazar. Tell me now.""

Blood was pounding in Harry's ears, but all that mattered was Susan. ""I couldn't say it before, but, I love you.""

Susan's eyes went very wide. Harry couldn't look away. ""I love you,"" he repeated. ""For so long, but I didn't know... I didn't think...""

He trailed off, unable to finish the sentence, but Susan's grip tightened on his fingers as understanding filled her face. ""Oh, Salazar,"" she breathed. She reached forward to cup his cheek. ""I love you too.""

Warmth exploded in Harry's chest. Susan blurred in front of him, and he heard her choke out a sob before she pulled him into a crushing hug. ""I loved you for so long,"" she whispered. ""I thought...I thought you considered me a friend. A dear one, but...""

""I thought I did too,"" Harry whispered. It was easier to speak like this, when he could just hold her. ""I had never loved anyone like that before. By the time I realised what I felt was different...""

Susan made a soft noise of understanding. ""By that time I thought friendship was all you wanted."" A watery chuckle escaped her. ""And to think we used to laugh at Godric and Rowena.""

Harry snorted. Reluctantly he pulled back, and rubbed his eyes enough to focus on her. She smiled back at her, her own face as tearstained as his, and Harry let out a shaky breath. ""I love you,"" he said. ""I think I always will.""

This time Susan was the one to hold out her hand, and Harry took it immediately. She was silent for a moment, but when she looked up her smile took Harry's breath away. ""I've loved you for a hundred years. I don't think anything is going to change.""

Harry couldn't speak. He had spent decades thinking he would never hear those words. He had never believed himself worthy of it, but Susan, Susan did, and he trusted her judgement more than anyone he had ever met. He smiled at her, heart overflowing with joy, and Susan's answering smile was so bright that it took his breath away.

They had wasted so much time in their first life.

Harry shook himself out of the memories and regrets. They had been given a second chance. They wouldn't make the same mistakes again. Susan let out a long breath, and when Harry looked back her smile had faded. Harry squeezed her hand.

""Helga?""

Susan hesitated a moment, then sighed. ""I do love you,"" she whispered. ""And that is why I need to ask you something.""

""What?""

Susan looked back, and Harry's heart clenched at the pain in her face. ""Please be careful,"" she said. ""I can't... You died, Salazar.""

Harry swallowed. He'd been avoiding thinking about his own death, and trying even harder to avoid the effect it must have had on his friends. Susan's hands were shaking.

""You died alone, and we were left behind. I don't...I can't do that again, Salazar.""

A lump filled Harry's throat. He had to swallow hard before he could reply, ""I'm sorry. I never wanted to leave you."" He took a deep breath, and sat up straight. ""I promise that I will be careful.""

That was as much as he could do. He might not be a Dark wizard hunter in this life, but he was the Boy Who Lived. Even if Voldemort wasn't dead, there were still plenty of his followers around. Harry was used to being a target, but the expression on Susan's face made him pause. 

He had never been good at looking after himself, but he had never wanted to hurt her.

""I'll try,"" he promised.

Susan let out a long shaky breath. ""Thank you."" She gave him a small smile. ""I know you won't stop fighting, and I would never ask you to, but you don't have to do it alone.""

""I know,"" said Harry quietly. ""I'm working on it,"" he amended, when Susan quirked an eyebrow at him. ""I don't want...I'd like to avoid that end this time.""

Susan flinched at the thought. Harry swallowed, and shifted so that he could wrap an arm around her. ""Sorry.""

""So am I,"" Susan whispered. ""You deserved so much better than that.""

For a long minute they sat in silence. Harry felt the memories of his ambush at death burning at the edges of his mind, and forced himself to focus on Susan. Susan was here, she was safe, and she loved him. It was more than he had ever thought possible.

Susan stirred in his arms.

""This time will be better.""

Her voice was quiet in it, but it held the same core of steel it had had when she voiced her desire to build a school for all magical children. Harry drew on that strength, and nodded.

""It will. We will make it better.""

Susan twisted to smile up at him. ""All we need now is Rowena.""

""We will find her,"" said Harry. ""She has to be here somewhere.""

She had to be, and she had to be around their age. It was the only thing that made sense. She would come to Hogwarts soon. Susan nodded, but there was a gleam in her eye that made Harry pause.

""What are you thinking?""

Susan straightened. ""There are three of us here now. Three of us, and Hogwarts. I think we can do more than just wait for her to come to us.""

A fission of excitement raced through Harry's body. Susan leaned forward, her dark eyes burning into his. ""I think we can find her, Harry.""

Harry let out a long breath. He didn't know if they could do that. He had no idea where they would even start. There was no telling if it was even possible.

People had said the same things about a school for magical children.

Harry looked back at Susan and smiled.

""We do have time to work on it.""

Susan's answering smile lit up the room. Harry closed his eyes and basked in the sense of rightness. Helga was back. She loved him. Anything was possible now.

Apologies for the delay in updating, working in the NHS during a pandemic has not been fun. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you liked this chapter.

Cedric waited with bated breathing for his mum to make her decision. Her face was very stern as she paced up and down, but when she looked back there was a familiar twinkle in her dark eyes.

""You won't go too high? Or too fast?""

""No,"" said Cedric. ""I'll be careful, promise.""

Mum's lips twitched, and she nodded. ""All right, but I expect you back in time for tea.""

Cedric beamed, and bounced to his feet. ""Thank you!""

His mother's laughter followed him as he raced through to the back of the house. The old, but well looked after Silver Arrow his grandfather had given him hung from its hook, and Cedric felt it shiver in its hands as he lifted it down.

""I know,"" he told it. ""It's been much too long.""

The new brooms at Hogwarts were great, but there was something special about his own broom. His parents had looked after it well while he was gone, but Cedric still checked it over carefully. A lifetime of fighting had taught him caution, and it was a good habit to get into besides.

By the time he was happy, his mum had packed him an appropriate selection of sweets, and a note for Mrs Weasley. Cedric settled his rucksack on his back, kissed her on the cheek, and shot off into the sky.

Cedric loved flying, in any weather and for any reason, but being on his way to spend a day with his friends on a clear winter morning was something special. He hadn't seen any of the Weasleys since they had broken up for the holidays, and while it had been good to be able to concentrate on Harry and Susan he had missed the Weasleys too.

It wasn't far to the Burrow, especially by air, but Cedric's hands were soon numb with cold. A Wandless Warming Charm helped though, and the beauty of his surroundings more than made up for it. He couldn't wait to show this to Harry and Rowena one day. They might even be able to coax Susan onto a broom. He smiled at the thought, and it widened when the Burrow came into view.

Someone must have spotted him, or his mum had called ahead, for red-heads were pouring out into the garden as Cedric started his descent. He landed in the garden, and barely had time to get his balance before Fred was thumping him on the back.

""How'd you get your mum to let you fly here?""

""I'm trustworthy,"" said Cedric with a grin, and laughed when the twins gave identical explosive snorts.

""Jammy git,"" said George. ""Mum won't let us fly in the orchard without Charlie there.""

""Yeah, 'cause she knows you,"" Charlie pointed out. He reached over Ron's head to shake Cedric's hand. ""It's good to see you, Cedric.""

Cedric smiled at him. Charlie was a sixth year now, and Quidditch Captain, and one of the most popular students at Hogwarts, but he hadn't changed at all. ""You too. How's the studying going?""

Charlie pulled a face. ""Nope. We're not talking about school on my day off from revising."" He squinted up at the clear sky. ""I know you just only just got here, but I don't know how long this weather's going to last, so if we want to get a game in...""

""Sounds good,"" said Cedric quickly. ""Give me a minute though, I need to say hello to your mum."" He glanced round and frowned. ""I'm guessing Percy's upstairs, but where's Ginny?""

She normally would have jumped on him by now. Charlie chuckled. ""She went over to see Luna. She'll be sorry she missed you.

Cedric smiled. ""I'll visit again before we go back to school."" He turned towards the house, and spotted Ron hovering at the edge of the group. ""Hi Ron. You ready for Quidditch?""

Behind him Fred sighed, but Ron lit up. ""Yeah! I've been practicing really hard!"" He bounced on his toes. ""And Percy got a new chess set for Christmas so I got his old pieces.""

""We'll have a game later,"" said Cedric, with a nod. 

Ron beamed at him, and Cedric stamped on Fred's foot without looking at him. Fred grumbled under his breath, but Cedric left George to handle him and slipped his rucksack off his shoulders. ""I'll be back in a minute.""

Mrs Weasley was bustling around the kitchen and Cedric smelled scones in the oven before he even opened the door. Tension he hadn't realised he'd been holding drained out of his shoulders. The Burrow had practically been a second home for the last eleven years, and he had spent a lot of time in this kitchen.

Harry would love it. He had never had a big family. Cedric pushed that thought firmly to the back of his mind, and pulled open the door.

""Good morning, Mrs Weasley.""

He was promptly engulfed in a floury hug. ""Hello, dear. I hope the flight over wasn't too cold."" She pulled back and gave him an appraising look. ""At least you had the sense to wear gloves.""

Cedric smiled. ""Mum wouldn't let me leave without them. Oh, and she made these for us.""

He handed over the bag of sufganiyot, and Mrs Weasley beamed at him. ""How wonderful, thank you. I'll send you back with some of these scones you like.""

""Cedric, come on!""

Cedric winced at the yell from the garden, but Mrs Weasley's eyes sparkled. ""You run along and play now, dear.""

He should have bristled at being talked to like that, but it was hard to get annoyed with Molly Weasley. Besides, he did want to play Quidditch. Cedric grinned at her, and dashed back out into the snow.

""I'm here,"" he called. ""What are the teams?""

""Cedric's with me!""

Cedric swallowed a laugh with an effort as the twins glared at each other. Fred's eyes narrowed. ""I said it first.""

George glared back. ""We said it at the same time,"" he growled. ""And he was on your team last time.""

""Was not. You're thinking of the time last summer-""

""Don't be stupid, you know what I'm talking about-""

""You're the stupid one if you can't remember that-""

""Stop that,"" Charlie snapped. The twins switched their glares to him, but Charlie just folded his arms and scowled back. ""We'll swap the teams around after each match. Cedric, you'll be with me first.""

""Sounds good,"" Cedric agreed.

Fred and George looked momentarily crestfallen, before exchanging identical grins. ""Fine,"" said Fred. ""But don't complain when we win.""

""I can promise you that we won't,"" said Cedric solemnly, but even as he said it he found his eyes drifting to Ron. The younger boy was watching them with wide eyes, but the slump of his shoulders betrayed his resignation. He sighed and started to turn back towards the house, and Cedric's heart clenched.

""Are you going to play, Ron?""

Fred frowned, but Ron looked like Christmas had come round again. ""Really? I can play?""

He turned to Charlie, and Cedric saw his resistance evaporate under that hopeful stare. Charlie chuckled and ruffled his brother's hair. ""Why not? The more the merrier."" He cocked his head to one side. ""It makes the teams uneven, but we'll cope.""

""Because having the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain on one of them didn't make it uneven at all,"" said Cedric pointedly.

Ron hastily turned a snort into a cough. The twins didn't bother hiding their cackles, but Cedric kept his most innocent expression in place as Charlie peered at him. ""Are you sure you're a Hufflepuff?""

""I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be,"" said Cedric firmly.

Charlie looked at him, his gaze turning appraising. ""Yes,"" he said. ""I think you are."" He flashed a sudden blinding grin, and chucked the Quaffle to Ron. ""Come on then. Let's get moving before the rain hits.""

Cedric grinned and grabbed his broom. It was going to be a good day.

Alastor was not having a good day.

For a start, he hated winter. The cold made his stump ache and the remains of his nose throb, and snow and ice were a pain in the arse to navigate. Add to that all the idiots that came out around the holidays, and Alastor was ready to sleep until spring.

If he was having a bad day though, Scrimgeour's was going even worse.

""How did they get hold of it?""

Alastor shrugged. The Ministry was as leaky as a sieve, and the Auror Department was no exception. Scrimgeour glared down at the front of the Prophet, where Sirius Black's personal statement was printed in full in their most impressive font, and slumped back into the chair.

""The mail room is already full of letters of protest,"" he said. ""The public were angry enough about the lack of a trial, and now this...""

He trailed off with a scowl. Alastor grimaced. ""Black always did have a way with words.""

He had heard enough from Minerva to know that, but even he had been surprised by just how eloquent the statement was. Persuasive was an understatement. Scrimgeour gave a thin smile.

""It's probably a good thing,"" he said. ""Fudge was already bowing under the weight of public opinion. I won't be surprised if he skips the trial altogether and goes straight for the pardon.""

Alastor bit back a comment with an effort, Scrimgeour was well aware of his opinions on Fudge, and focused on the matter at hand. ""Wouldn't be such a bad thing. He's been on the run long enough.""

Scrimgeous grunted. His hand dropped to massage his bad knee as he squinted up at Alastor. ""Still no luck tracking him down?""

Anyone who didn't know him as well as Alastor did would have missed the amusement in his eyes. Alastor just shrugged again. ""He's good, but I have some ideas.""

Scrimgeour sat back in his chair. ""Maybe you should go and follow them up.""

Alastor smirked at him. ""Try a heating charm on that knee,"" he said. ""Works wonders."" He pushed himself off from the wall and stomped towards the door. ""Don't murder Fudge before I get back.""

Scrimgeour's snort of laughter followed him from the room, and Alastor smirked as he left the department and headed for the atrium. Being an Auror was a tough job, but at least his boss wasn't one of his problems.

The usual horde of vultures were waiting in the atrium, but not even Skeeter tried to ask him for a comment. Alastor favoured them with a smile that made a couple of the younger ones blanche, then turned on his heel and Disapparated. 

There was even more snow in Birmingham than there was in London. Alastor swore under his breath as he made his way through to Lupin's inconspicuous little terraced house. His mood improved slightly when he faint the faint crackle of static that indicated they'd finally put up some sort of protections, but when he thumped on the door there was no reply.

""Lupin,"" he barked. ""Open up.""

He knocked again, harder this time, and finally the door swung open to reveal a harried-looking Lupin. Alastor spared a moment to be grateful that Black had finally learned to stay out of sight before scowling. 

""What kept you?""

""Sorry,"" said Lupin. ""We were upstairs.""

He closed the door and hurried back up without another word. Alastor sighed and followed.

The house looked like a whirlwind had gone through it. Old books and papers were scattered everywhere, and Alastor spotted old toys and joke shop products underneath the dust. Black stood in the centre of the chaos going through yet another trunk, and he didn't look up as they entered.

""They're not here either!""

Lupin sighed. ""I told you I haven't seen them in years."" He picked up a battered Snitch, expression turning nostalgic. ""I'd forgotten I'd kept this.""

""Focus, Moony,"" Black snapped. ""Where else could they be?""

""What the hell is going on here?"" Alastor demanded.

Black spun round, wand appearing in his hand, only to trip on a sheaf of papers and hit the ground with a crash. Alastor rolled his eyes. ""Your situational awareness is dreadful.""

Black scrambled to his feet and stuffed his wand back into his jeans. ""Yeah, yeah, whatever. What do you want, Moody?""

""I asked first.""

Lupin stepped between them before an argument could ensue. ""We heard from Harry again.""

""What? What did he say?""

Lupin smiled, and it made him look a decade younger. ""He liked our Christmas present. I think he might be starting to trust us.""

Alastor gave a non-committal grunt, and Black huffed. ""He's not going to trust us if we can't help him now. Why did you go and lose them for?""

""I didn't do it on purpose,"" said Lupin, rolling his eyes. ""It's not a disaster, we can make new ones easily enough-""

""That'll take time, and Harry wants them now!"" 

""What does he want?"" Alastor asked.

Lupin sighed. ""He asked if we knew of a way to communicate face to face."" He looked at Black, and when Black shrugged he continued, ""When we were at school we had these mirrors. They were paired, so if you spoke into one the other person could hear you.""

""We used to use them in detention,"" said Black. For a moment his expression was wistful, before the manic energy returned. ""Now Harry needs them and we can't bloody find them!""

Alastor had to take a moment to pull his mind back from the multitude of ways that that sort of communication could be helpful before he could reply. ""How long would it take to make new ones?""

Black waved a hand. ""A few days, once we get the base materials, but that's too slow!""

""Sirius,"" said Lupin with a sigh, ""Harry doesn't need them straight away. He asked if we had ideas, not if we could provide him with an instant solution.""

""I don't care! It's been years, Remus! I want to see my godson!"" He paused, eyes gleaming. ""I know where mine are.""

Lupin frowned, then his eyes widened and he shook his head. ""You cannot break into Grimmauld Place!""

""Why not?""

""You were disowned, Sirius! If your mother sees you-""

""I'm not afraid of her,"" Black spat. ""Or Kreacher, or anything else in that hellhole.""

""Hold on,"" Alastor interrupted. ""Black, have you forgotten that you're a fugitive?""

""I don't-""

""And that your house is under surveillance?""

""So?"" Black demanded. ""I can dodge them easily enough. I broke out of Azkaban, didn't I?""

Lupin let his head fall against the wall. Alastor took a deep breath and fixed Black with his fiercest glare. ""You're an idiot.""

Black flushed, but Alastor didn't give him a chance to interrupt, ""You're going to get yourself captured or killed, and for what? A couple of mirrors that you can reproduce in a couple of days anyway?""

""For Harry,"" Black snarled. ""For all the times I let him down before.""

""Getting yourself hurt is not going to help Harry,"" Alastor insisted. ""You know that."" He took a step closer. ""You're burning up with the need to do something, but you're not thinking. Harry needs you alive and free, not in prison, and definitely not caught up with your damned family.""

""But I have to do something!"" Black exploded. He turned on his heel and started pacing, eyes flashing and voice rising higher and higher. ""I abandoned him! He was stuck with those people for years, and he hated so much that he ran away to Merlin knows where, and I wasn't there!""

""Sirius,"" Lupin began, but Black silenced him with a look.

""I failed him,"" he rasped, and the quiet devastation was worse than the screaming. ""I failed him for so long. I can't...I won't fail him again.""

Alastor's chest ached. None of this should have happened. Harry and Black both deserved so much better. He shifted, at a loss for how to help, and it was Lupin who stepped forward. He rested a hand on Black's shoulder, and when Black didn't react he gripped both arms hard.

""You won't,"" he said fiercely. ""Neither of us will. But we can't keep rushing into things, Sirius. We have to think about Harry first.""

The two of them stared at each other for a long minute. Alastor watched patiently, until finally Black sagged as if his strings had been cut. Lupin caught him into a fierce hug.

""I know,"" he said. ""We'll find him. We won't let him down again.""

Alastor gave them a minute before clearing his throat. ""What do you need to make these mirrors?""

Black gaped at him, then a brilliant smile spread across his face. For a moment he looked like the young man who had fought alongside them, then he moved forward to grip Alastor's hand.

""Thank you.""

Alastor coughed. ""All right,"" he said gruffly. ""Least I could do.""

Both of them were looking at him in a way that made him very uncomfortable, and he cast about for a change of subject. The copy of the most recent Daily Prophet lying in the corner was as good as any.

""Your statement made an impact.""

Lupin followed his gaze and shook his head. ""It's the first time I've been glad that the Ministry is so unreliable,"" he said dryly.

Black snorted, and Alastor nodded. ""Press is having a field day. Wouldn't be surprised if the Minister takes action soon.""

""Good,"" said Black. His grey eyes glittered as they met Alastor's. ""I've got work to do.""

""Check.""

Cedric stared at the chessboard, then at Ron. ""Huh,"" he managed. ""I didn't see that one coming.""

Ron's ears blazed red as he gave a shy smile. ""Percy found a book on chess in the library and brought it home for me. It was interesting.""

""I can see you've learned a lot,"" said Cedric. The game wasn't unsalvageable, but it was going to be a bit more tricky than he was expecting. He moved his king out of danger, and winced when it cost him his remaining bishop. ""That was a good move.""

""Thanks,"" Ron mumbled.

His ears were still as red as his hair. Cedric grinned, suddenly even more glad than ever that he'd made the time for a game before heading home. The Weasleys were some of his favourite people, but Ron was unassuming enough that it was easy for him to fall through the cracks. Seeng him so happy was worth getting home a bit late.

Cedric did end up winning the game, but it was the closest he had come to losing in a long time. Ron pulled a face as he carefully packed his pieces away. 

""I'll beat you next time,"" he vowed. ""I'm going to ask Percy to look for more books when he goes back to Hogwarts.""

""That's a good idea,"" said Cedric. He thought for a moment. ""It might be worth checking the Muggle library in town too. Muggles play chess too, after all."" 

""I hadn't thought of that. Thanks!""

""No problem."" He ruffled Ron's hair, and grinned when he ducked away the same way Harry did. ""Maybe you should look into competitions. You'd definitely stand a chance.""

Ron ducked his head in a futile attempt to hide an even brighter blush. ""Maybe,"" he mumbled. 

He opened his mouth, then paused and closed it again. Cedric cocked his head to one side. Ron was as competitive as Charlie and the twins, and he would normally leap at a chance to prove himself, but his eyes were fixed on the chess pieces. Cedric chewed on his lip for a moment, but he couldn't leave that alone.

""What's wrong?""

""Nothing,"" Ron squeaked.

It would be more convincing if he managed to meet Cedric's gaze. Cedric leaned forward. ""Come on, Ron. You can talk to me.""

Ron nodded. He took a deep breath and looked up. ""I just... Can I ask you something?""

""Of course,"" said Cedric. ""You can ask me anything, you know that."" He gripped Ron's shoulder. ""What's on your mind?""

Ron hesitated a moment longer, then took another breath. ""When you were sorted into Hufflepuff, was it because you wanted to, or because your parents were there?""

Cedric blinked at him. Whatever he had been expecting, that wasn't it. Ron shifted in his seat. ""Never mind,"" he muttered. ""It doesn't matter.""

He started to push himself upright, and Cedric hurried to catch his arm. ""I don't mind,"" he said. ""I just hadn't thought about it.""

Ron sat back with a small smile. Cedric considered his answer for a minute, then nodded to himself. He couldn't tell the whole truth, but Ron wouldn't ask for no reason and he deserved a proper answer. ""A bit of both, I guess,"" he said finally. ""I knew it would make my parents happy, but I wouldn't have gone there if I would have fitted in better somewhere else.""

Ron nodded slowly. Cedric studied him. ""Can I ask why you were thinking about it?""

Ron shrugged. His eyes dropped to the king he was rolling around in his fingers, but Cedric waited and after a minute Ron's shoulders slumped. ""I thought you'd be in Gryffindor.""

Cedric had to smile. ""I thought about it,"" he admitted. ""But I like Hufflepuff as much as I would have liked Gryffindor.""

Ron frowned slightly, but didn't argue. He kept his eyes on the king. ""Weasleys have been in Gryffindor for generations.""

Cedric let out a long breath as the meaning behind Ron's questions became clear. ""I've heard,"" he said. ""But you know you don't have to go there if you don't want to.""

Ron snorted. ""Yeah, like the twins would ever let me live that down.""

""It's not up to them,"" said Cedric firmly. ""And if they tried to give you any problems then I'd deal with it.""

Ron looked up at that, his eyes wide with surprise, and Cedric smiled at him. ""You can go wherever you want, Ron. Even Slytherin, and don't start with that 'all Slytherins are evil' nonsense,"" he added, when Ron frowned. ""You've heard about Pettigrew in the news, and he was a Gryffindor. Dark wizards come from all houses, not just Slytherin.""

Ron looked slightly taken aback by his fervour, and Cedric reigned himself back in with an effort. He knew he had feelings about this, and he didn't want to make anyone too suspicious. Ron still didn't look entirely convinced though, and Cedric sighed.

""Look, I've got a friend who is almost definitely going to be in Slytherin, and he's one of the kindest people I've ever met. Just think about it, will you?""

Ron frowned, but he nodded. Cedric smiled, and ruffled his hair again. ""I really should get going, but I'll see you before we go back to school.""

""Okay,"" said Ron. ""Thanks, Cedric.""

Cedric smiled, and went to say goodbye to the twins. It looked like he had another project. If they were going to put an end to the destructive antagonism that had sprung up between their houses, then this was as good a place to start as any.

""We might have a problem.""

Harry tore his eyes from the Tamil dictionary he was paging through and blinked up. ""What kind of problem?""

Helena floated down to eye level. She smiled slightly as she took in what he was working on, but her expression soon turned serious. ""That prank you pulled on Professor Snape.""

Harry smirked at the reminder but Helena's next words banished all traces of amusement, ""He knows that none of his students could be behind it.""

""What?"" Harry demanded. ""How?""

Yes, it had been a new creation, but he had been careful. Nothing in that potion had been beyond the capabilities of a talented student, even one who hadn't finished their studies. 

Except Salazar had known the capabilities of every single one of his students. If Snape was half the Potions Master Harry had heard he was...

Harry groaned and let his head fall onto the desk.

""What did I miss?""

A chill touched the back of his neck as Helena drifted closer. ""You used liverwort as the catalyst. Various substitutes discovered in North America have been far more popular for centuries.""

Harry winced. He really should have thought of that. ""I'm never going to live this down.""

""You're not infallible, Uncle,"" said Helena gently. ""Not even you can absorb a thousand years of knowledge in six months.""

Harry managed a weak huff, but his mind was racing at the implications. If Snape knew that someone else was responsible for creating that potion they were going to have to be far more careful with the knowledge they displayed in class.

Well, Cedric would. Harry and Susan wouldn't have that issue for a couple of years yet. He still should have known better.

""I got cocky.""

He hated to admit it, but it was true. He had been so determined to do something, anything to protect their students, that he had let his creativity get ahead of his common sense. It wasn't a mistake he could afford to repeat.

""It's not such a disaster,"" said Helena. ""They already knew that something was going on."" A wry smile touched her face. ""You haven't exactly kept a low profile.""

Harry snorted and raised his head to look at her. ""Exorcising Binns and burning down the broom shed within the first months probably did stir some suspicions,"" he agreed. ""I expect Rowena will have something to say about that too.""

Helena's smile faltered slightly at the mention of her mother, but she covered it quickly. ""The Headmaster is looking into it. He's asked all of us to keep our eyes open, and he's been doing research into Hogwarts' earliest records.""

""For all the good that will do him,"" said Harry. Hogwarts wouldn't cooperate, not when it came to them. The ghosts were a different matter, but Harry had had plenty of practice at dodging enemies. Not that the ghosts were enemies, but it was good practice.

Still, he would have to be careful. Cedric would need to be warned. Harry took a deep breath and nodded.

""Thank you. Will you tell me if you hear anything else?""

""Of course,"" said Helena. She grinned suddenly. ""This is the most fun I've had in centuries.""

Harry burst out laughing. He couldn't help it. Helena looked absolutely delighted with herself, and the weight evaporated from Harry's shoulders. It had been too long since he had last seen his niece look like that. Helena beamed at him, and arranged herself as if sitting on the sofa next to him.

""How are you getting on with that?""

Harry wiped his eyes and refocused on the notebooks. ""Slowly. It's a beautiful language, but it's hard to learn from books.""

Helena nodded. ""Well, with any luck it won't be long until you can get lessons in person.""

Harry glanced at the latest copy of the Daily Prophet and smiled. Things were looking very promising on the godfather front, and he had received a hastily scribbled note from Sirius promising that they had a solution to his communication problems too.

Things were definitely beginning to look up."

""You have all your things?"" She asks.

""Yes, Mum."" 

She pauses for a minute then straightens her posture. ""Good. Now, then,"" she gestures to the Hogwarts Express. ""It's nearly eleven, you should be leaving."" His mother surprises him by pulling Draco into one last, brief hug and then adjusting his tie.

Draco grabs his things. ""I'll see you for Christmas, Mum."" She smiles at him and shooed him off. ""Yes, yes, I know. Go on, I'm sure your friends are waiting for you."" He raises an eyebrow. ""Mum, Hermione's the only one that's consistently on time for anything.""

""Then I'm sure you can either find her or save them all a seat. Now, go on.""

""Bye, Mum,"" Draco says as he grabs all his luggage to lug it onto the train. He makes his way through the platform, nodding politely to people even as they slightly inch away from him and his almost healed new scar from the last moon. (Just a slight scratch. Only problem is it's on the edge of his left cheek, by his ear.)

Even though it was just over half past ten, most of the compartments were already full. Draco had been right- there was no sign of even Hermione this time. He quickly abandoned the idea of a completely empty compartment and settled for one near the end of the train that only had a sleeping man in the corner seat. Must be the new Defense professor, he thought to himself. As he stowed his trunk, he saw what must have been the professor's, because it was the only other one there. R. J. Lupin was printed on the end in peeling gold lettering, and the trunk itself looked barely held together, as though it was a gift from ages ago that was well worn. The man's robes were a bit tatty as well.

Ignoring the man, Draco got out Standard Book of Spells, Grade 3, and sprawled out in his normal fashion to read until Harry, Ron and Hermione managed to find their way to his compartment. 

By the time the train had started moving, he was slightly worried- he doubted anyone wanted a repeat of last year. But just as he had made up his mind to search the train for them, the door slided open and he saw Hermione's face poke in. ""Draco!""

""Oh, good, we found him,"" he heard Ron tell Harry as the three made their way into the compartment. 

""Careful,"" Draco half-whispered to them, ""Think he's asleep.""

Harry quietly slid the door closed again. ""What do you reckon?"" He asked after they had all moved their trunks. ""Never had an adult on the Express before.""

Draco pointed to the man's suitcase exactly as Hermione did the same, while saying, ""My bet's on Defense professor.""

""Oh, bloody hell,"" Ron said, which earned him an elbow and a hissed ""Ron!"" from Hermione. ""Everyone knows it's jinxed, right? He looks like a cold could finish him off!"" He tried to defend himself amidst Harry and Draco's conspiratorial glance and then chuckles.

""To be fair, he does look a bit ill,"" Harry remarked. ""Speaking of ill-"" he pointed to Draco's cheek. Hermione and Ron must have not seen it before, because Hermione gasped while Ron practically shouted a slew of curses that made even Harry look away from Draco's cheek to elbow the redhead to shut up as to not wake the professor. 

Draco, meanwhile, turned his face away from the three towards the window with a muttered, ""I'm fine."" When he glanced at the trio, he was met with three sets of raised eyebrows. ""Oh, come off it. I'm fine. Really.""

""Uh huh.""

""Sure, mate.""

""Absolutely perfect.""

""You three are the worst."" There was an awkward pause, then all four busted out into laughter. The fit lasted a few minutes, but once it had died down, it was Ron who broke the mood. ""In all seriousness, though- are you really okay?"" Draco gave him a shrug. ""It is what it is. Couldn't get our hands on a full batch last time. Not as bad as it could have been, but, still.""

""Well,"" Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper, ""You guys should be happy to know that I finally got my hands on the book.""

""What?"" Harry said out loud before remembering to whisper because of the guest to their conversation. ""How?"" He added quieter. ""Diagon Alley,"" She replied. ""Managed to find it in a secondhand shop. Bit worn, but perfectly readable.""

""Excellent,"" Ron added. 

""Guys, not that I'm not appreciative, but you really don't have to do this,"" Draco tried to interject, but there was no stopping Hermione Granger on a mission. ""Draco,"" she said to him. ""We've all thought about it. All of us have agreed. We want to do this for you.""

""Yeah, okay, but breaking the law? That's a lot. Are you really, absolutely, sure you all want to do this? If you get caught, you could go to Azkaban.""

""If. And we all know the risks, mate,"" Ron told him. 

""Besides,"" Harry interjected. ""What's life without a little rule-breaking?"" 

Draco sighed. ""Well, am I outvoted on this one, then?""

""Yep,"" Ron said, which really summed it all up. 

Hermione pulled the book out of her bag. ""It's incredibly complicated- even more than the polyjuice. I've only glanced over it- probably best for all of us to read it together.""

""Yeah, probably best,"" Harry agreed.

""So, Harry, you said you had something to tell all of us once we met up with Draco-"" Hermione gasped in a little bit and cut her sentence short when she heard a soft snore from Lupin. The four silently gazed at each other for a long minute. ""Alright,"" Harry said after their pause had gone on for what felt like forever, ""I think he's still asleep.""

Draco breathed a sigh a relief. The last thing they needed was an interrogation from a teacher they didn't know. He directed his attention to the dark haired boy. ""Okay, what were you going to tell us?""

""Right,"" Harry said before giving himself a small Shake of the head. ""So, Ron, last night I heard your parents talking- arguing more like- because your dad wanted to tell me that Sirius Black escaped Azkaban to come after me.""

""Bloody hell, mate-""

""Harry-""

Draco just raised his eyebrow and motioned for the other boy to continue. ""And he also made me swear that I wouldn't go looking for Black. Which also explains why Fudge wasn't even mad that I blew up Aunt Marge, he was just all huffy that I stormed off afterwards.""

He did a double take. ""Wait, you blew up your aunt?"" Draco asked incredulously. Ron started snickering for what looked to be a second time, due to the fact that Hermione seemed to be expecting it and then elbowed him a second after he began. ""It's not funny, Ronald Weasley!"" But Draco had started chuckling as well. ""It kind of is, Hermione.""

""Oh, not you, too,"" She sighed. ""Boys,"" She muttered. Harry rolled his eyes at the others' antics. ""Well, it was an accident. She was spouting all this crap about my mum and dad, and it's not like Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were discouraging her. At all.""  

""Yeah, I s'pose,"" Ron said. ""Hey,"" he continued, ""When do you think the trolley will be coming?""

After that, the conversation turned to simple chatter. Draco tuned out for some of it, though he learned some interesting things. Hermione got a cat that Ron thought was the Devil. The Cannons were doing terribly (as usual). Harry liked his birthday presents, and he made sure to thank Ron for the Sneakoscope, Hermione for the Broom Service Kit, and Draco for the Indian cookbook he got him. 

""Was a bummer I haven't had the chance to use it, but that's to be expected. Still, thanks,"" he told Draco.

Nothing eventful really happened after that, until the trolley came. ""Finally,"" Ron exclaimed. I'm starving.""

""Ron, it's only been a couple hours since breakfast,"" Hermione said, exasperated.

""Exactly! A couple hours!"" The redhead replied, which resulted in a groan from Hermione. Draco himself only got some pumpkin cakes and more than probably necessary chocolate frogs.

""You, my friend,"" Harry said pointedly, ""Have an obsession with that stuff.""

""Chocolate is superior to everything. I stand by that,"" Draco told him, trying to defend himself.

The sleepy lull of the journey returned, excluding when they managed to use Lupin to their advantage to avoid anything with Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle, for once. Draco had arrived in his robes, so after lunch Hermione and the other two boys went to change. ""Best get it over with early, I guess,"" Harry had conceded, and Ron followed by shrugging. 

When they left, Draco almost decided to pick up where he left off in Standard Book of Spells, but then changed his mind and pulled out The Hobbit. When the other three returned, Hermione followed his lead and pulled out one of her own books (Hogwarts, a History, if Draco wasn't mistaken). Ron and Harry showed no interest in reading their books, so they ended up talking just to each other (Exploding Snap would have woken the professor up, Ron didn't have his chess set in his bag- but that might have woken up the professor too, so it was just as well).

Hours later, Draco had almost finished the book when suddenly the train stopped, pulling him out of the pages. Hermione had been startled out of her book as well, and the four looked at each other with confusion. ""Surely we're not there yet?"" Hermione asked.

""No, I don't think so,"" replied Harry. 

None of them had to ponder on it for very long as the lights went out just as Harry poked his head through the door."

Not everyone was brave.

She wasn't brave.

She couldn't be the protagonist of this story that everyone wanted her to be. Not that anyone in this new life knew what she was meant to be, what she would become.

No, Lily Potter while not knowing what would happen, the pain and agony she- he, her baby would face, a pig to the slaughter. For now she was just a woman in the middle of the war trapped in the ""safe"" house with her husband slowly going stir crazy, but trying to power through it. It didn't help that their darling baby boy was deadly silent, making both parents worry. At first, the child had cried for days on end, unable to be soothed then one day he just stopped. They were worried but what could they do? No one but Sirius knew where they were at, and he wasn't that knowledgeable in child care nor healing spells that they would need to check over Harry's mental and physical growth.

They didn't know the turmoil that roared inside their baby's little head, the tiny squishy brain trying to handle the onslaught of memories of another life, of the body dysmorphia, of the fact she had lost everything. 

She was sorry, so sorry at the sight of their dark circles under their eyes, all caused by her wails of terror that went on for weeks unable to understand what was happening around her. But she only wished to see her real mother, who raised her with a firm hand, yet let the softness of herself show in private. Of their native roots that most would spit at, or try to claim for brownie points. She wanted her mothers out of tune singing, her true singing voice only coming through when she spoke the language of their people, a beautiful, deep soothing sound.

Not a woman of white freckled skin, bright auburn hair, and a voice that was so beautiful that if she had been herself, she would've loved to listen to her. Not of a father, with dark skin, worlds apart from the movie she watched so long ago, and the books that never spoke of a skin color at all. Not a father with dark brown eyes so deep and loving that she started to cry knowing she would lose it all. He was so kind, so sweet, and gentle with her, taking an active part in her new life.

She tried not to get attached, and with her new mother it was easier she had a mother to hold onto but... Not a father, and found she wasn't sure if she could survive without them. He was the father she never had, as the first was a wandering vagabond doing his best to get out of the rez and selling cheap shit from their culture to mildly curious white people. Now all it did was remind her of everything she had lost, and would continue to not have in this new world, of the more things she would come to lose  if she kept living.

The life of one little boy didn't matter, in the very end, when it came to the life and happiness of a whole magical world. The life of one man and one woman, wouldn't matter either in the grand scheme of things. Even if the non-magical outnumbered them three to one. She could understand that- she really could, it was a hard choice, a damning choice. Damned if she did and damned if she didn't. Let one little boy live with his small family while thousands other little children were slaughtered, or end everything with three lives? It seems easy, when one was thinking of it with cool detachment. No attachment to the people there, which is why she couldn't understand why Dumbldore could look Lily, James and her in the eye with seemingly no remorse for what he was doing. Without attachment or understanding she could understand, but these two were children he had watched grown, had even spoken too, and mentored.

The thing was, she was selfish. So selfish and she knew it. She wasn't brave either, she was terrified of the abuse, terrified of pain, of doctors, bills, the government and every other aspect of life. She had barely begun to live in her other life, saving up to buy an apartment at the very least. Now she was back to square one staring up at the ceiling with a dead gaze able to hear the hushed whispers of her parents from the doorway as they watched her motionless form. The only way the two twenty-one year old's knew that their child still lived was the slow rise and fall of his tiny chest.

""James, I'm terrified- something is wrong with Harry, he doesn't laugh he doesn't smile or eat as much as he's suppose too I just-"" and Lily's voice cracked, the sound making her tiny body shiver subconsciously at the height of emotion. She was far too deep in her mind for the emotional impact to do anything to her, to fully hit her on a conscious level. She could hear them, could see them even if they were blurry figures in the distance but-

""I know Lily-flower. I just wish I knew what to do."" James' voice was thick as well, and if she could see clearly she would've been able to see the tears already streaming down his cheeks from the uncertainty of if their child would even live to see his first birthday.

If she had it her way, she wouldn't. She- she- a name lost to time and memories, so in a fit of inspiration she came up with a new name. Emory. A name for now, for her own purpose because she was different then the woman who had been lost to time.

""Mum and dad would've known what to do,"" James voice, horse with emotion spoke, wavering the pain of his parents loss still heavy in his chest.

""Mine too,"" Lily murmured in agreement.

Emory knew that Lily Potters parents were still alive out there, she had been the one to listen to this new life's mother mutter and curse to herself as she built wards right in front of her meant to protect them. Lily wouldn't know that her parents wouldn't make it through the war, but also could hear her and James talk in hushed whispers in bed about where she/he would go if they were to die. (She was sure that she should've been moved to the nursery by now, but whenever Lily hedged the question James venomously refused. Lily seemed to relax as if all she had wanted was her husband to disagree so that she could put the move off for another time.) Lily's parents were the second on the list, the first being Sirius under the pretense that him, Remus and Peter would raise her together. Lily's parents second, with the help of the Longbottom's to stay connected to the magical world in ways to be sure nothing was headed their way.

It was sad, listening to Lily cry, and talk about how if the worst happened, her parents would love her son dearly.

Emory though, wasn't brave enough to live even if she had the guarantee of being raised by Lily's parents.

Which is what leads her to now, clutching a metal fork she had stolen from lunch and looking for an outlet in hopes that Lily Potter, so connected to the non-magical world would've had this place installed with electricity even if it was a magical home. The starving hadn't worked, after refusing to eat for three days her dad- James, who apparently was proficient in healing would just spell her mothers milk (ew) into her stomach once the both realized she wouldn't eat on her own.

""Hey little man, what'cha up too,"" a deep vice called as she cursed inside her brain, crawling faster down the hall as if to get away from him. She was so close, she could feel it- if she could just get down the stairs and to the living room with the fork she swore she saw an outlet in the kitchen.

""Oh whoa hold up!"" James cried out as she crawled even faster towards the stairs, his fingers missing her by a hairs breath. Electrocution wasn't the most painless way to die, but she needed to do something quick before that time came. They could have another baby- she was sure Lily was already pregnant anyway because she had a thoughtful hand over her stomach. (Not like they had much else to do trapped in the house like this. Oh, if only she had some bleach to drink to forget the sounds!) They could have a normal, happy baby that wasn't an imposter wearing the skin of an infant.

She jumped, which was more of a flop, feeling the air whizz by as she tumbled down the stairs, tiny arms flailing, the fork having been dropped in the chaos. The only feeling that raced through her was regret that Jams had to see this. Her fathers scream of horror quickly called Lily to his side, the door to her potion brewing room slamming open as she rushed with her wand in hand. She was too late though, a gasp of her own ripping from her throat as the sight of her son falling form. 

Emory didn't have time to feel excited at her nearing death, her actions not planned out, she could only hope it was swift- When her head cracked on the wooden step she didn't black out, her tiny baby body didn't even break a bone. Her head bounced off the step as if it was a bouncy ball. She continued to bounce down the stairs, screaming all the way in her fit of anger at her failure. She had been starving herself for fucks sake, she shouldn't have enough magical power to protect herself!

""HARRY,"" Lily yelled, her wand snapping out her magic swirling around Emory's tiny baby body, cushioning her. The next thing she knew she was being clutched tightly in Lily's arms. ""Oh my god- Oh my god, you're oaky- he's okay oh fuck James that scared the shite out of me, fuck, fuck please don't you ever do that again."" Lily kissed the top of Emory's head, over and over again, cuddling her close and practically squeezing the life out of her. Ha, ha if only. Rocking her back and forth in a soothing motion to stop her wails.

James seemed shell shocked, standing in place at the top of the stairs as if a statue, while Emory tried to thrash out of Lily's arms, green eyes filling with tears, but not for the reason that both Lily and James assumed it was. She wailed, harder and louder then anything she had before, causing both parents to jump into action, soothing murmurs, gentle touches, and singing lullabies, or trying to distract her with magic that she couldn't even take joy in because they were going to die and she was going to be the cause of it.

If only her fucking magic didn't save her.

When I was younger I was going through a lot of things, I had this story idea of basically a suicidal self-insert like character being placed as Harry Potter trying to kill herself only to never succeed. Back then I thought it was such a great joke, ""haha you want to die so bad yet the world thwarts you at every turn, making you live your miserable life."" Now that I'm older I think the real reason I never let the character die was because I had hoped my life was worth saving no matter how much I wished for it to end.

That I was worth saving.

I found the work recently while trying to clean out some things in my room and edited until it was something I didn't mind sharing. Not sure if this is for myself, to show myself silently how much I have changed; or for others out there feeling the same way. Real cheesy I get it, but honestly while hanging on is the hardest shit you are ever going to do in this life, if you keep moving forward no matter how slow time feels, you will find that reason to live. Life doesn't get easier, not always, but it's not as bad as everyone told you it's going to be. It's just different from what you expect and sometimes... Different, while scary isn't always a bad thing. Just keep on going, no matter what happens because there are a billion people out there, and you will find that love comes from the craziest of places.

Emory finds that the world she thought she knew, wasn't all that it's cracked up to be. If one thing was different, then did she really have the right to say she knew what else happened in this world? Maybe she was wrong about it all- then again there are some things that just never change no matter what world you're in.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The world that Emory had found herself in was different, neither movie, nor books could prepare her for the un-predictableness of them all. Of James, who was desi, Indian- not the type she had been called as a child, and had called herself that as well. He had such a deep connection with his culture, one even she hadn't had with her tribe. Somewhere along the way of moving off of the rez she had found that she had lost it. Between people telling her she didn't have dark enough skin to be a native, from others assuming since she called herself an Indian that she was a racist white person trying to pretend to be native to get brownie points. The shame of practicing her spiritual beliefs in the open, of even speaking of her tribe was all there, even though she was apart of that culture since the beginning. 

The more she tried to shape herself, to fit in the new political climate of the world, the more she was beaten down. Changing her speech from Indian, to native, even then some folks had a problem with how she referred to herself. She had like using native, it was a broader term, she didn't have to go speaking of which tribe to people who wouldn't know how to pronounce the words. Yet, in this world for women and native women at that, it was all about proving herself to get some sliver of respect. Even when she showed her knowledge of her own tribe, they still berated her for not calling herself native American as was ""proper"". That she was only making it worse for her brothers, sisters and siblings in blood. Defending themselves, once they found out she was truly native, still finding some way to say she was in the wrong, and that they were right.

What right did they have? Her people were the ones that had died, some colonizer from Europe had no damn right in telling HER how she should refer to herself, of what her people were going through. 

They didn't know anything.

It wasn't just them, others who were just like her, a minority in the majority, would push her tribes troubles down, fighting for the spotlight, to be seen when that's what the government wanted them to do in the first place. To fight amongst each other until none was left. They had to stand together- yet, everyone seemed to hate natives. A stain covered up with a rug. She wondered if this is what the Armenians felt like when their people were slaughtered right in front of  their eyes by the Ottoman empire, and all they were to the outside world, were a passing page in the history books never to be taught in American schools nor known like the holocaust was.

It was heartbreaking.

She had a new reason to cry tonight, even though James spoke of some special night in Hindu culture coming up that he wanted to share with her, that she couldn't come to accept. She didn't care about what he was talking about, she wanted her life back, the pow wows, the dances, standing around the bonfire as they roasted some deer you accidentally ran over. To use everything before burying the bones to give thanks for the things they were given and use every bit of the animal.

There was so much waste in America.

British people seemed to be just as wasteful.

She grumbled in baby distaste, as she watched Sirius vanish the burnt cake he had made. The shaggy haired man, had put a finger to his lips, a dramatic shush. He was so goofy looking, that if she was herself, she would've laughed easily. Instead she scowled deeply, before going back to smacking blocks together in annoyance. If she was going to be annoyed then she would annoy Sirius with her sounds until he left her alone.

She never had a Godfather, nor a Godmother- and she didn't care for one either. She didn't need him, and he best learn it fast.

""Ah, fine grumpy pants, go tattle on me once you know how to speak,"" Sirius huffed, sounding like a tired old dog. ""If you ever learn too speak."" 

She sent him a poisonous glare, but in the end it probably looked like she just closed her eyes. She could talk! At least, she could before. She wasn't sure, right now, she had tried tirelessly when everyone else was asleep or too busy to try to make sounds that were words, but it was so hard. It was beyond humiliating, so why should she try anyway. She wasn't going to live long enough for these people to find out in the first place.

She fully ignored the worry that was painted across Sirius' face, the same that was on her parents as she missed most baby milestones. 

""Well either way you're soon going to be a baldy baby,"" Sirius snickered as he started to silently send out cleaning charms around the disastrous kitchen. ""James parents did it to him when he was a baby, showed me the pictures the first summer I came here and man he looked ridiculous let me tell you. Though his parents had a barber and a priest for his first hair cut. He's going to do it for you too, even though he can't follow it by the letter, and then he'll show your boyfriend, or girlfriend whichever, those pictures like his parents showed me.""

Her brows which had been furrowed as she aggravatingly slammed letter blocks together, soothed by Sirius' voice. Her throat suddenly felt thick, as being queer when she was younger wasn't nearly as acceptable to her mom. She hadn't even known that you could be gay until she turned twelve an had seen two women kissing. She sniffled quietly, trying not to give into her baby instincts to wail out, and search for those familiar warm arms of James to hide in. 

""Hey little fawn,"" Sirius voice was hesitant, as he had walked over, sliding his wand into his wand holster. She couldn't see him that well due to her baby eyes. She wasn't crying, not again- she's already cried too many times in front of strangers an she couldn't-

""Shhh hey it's okay,"" Sirius voice was smooth, low- not like her fathers that rumbled, Sirius' was more like a purr. Which she was sure he'd love to be told he sounded more like a cat than a dog. His thin arms wrapped around her tiny body, resting her against his chest making sure her ear was pressed to his skin, to listen to his heart beat.  

""Hey if you're that upset about being bald we can always give you a hair growth potion then you'll have luscious locks just like mine.""

""That,"" James voice called from down the hall, growing closer as he made his way to the living room. ""Defeat's the purpose of Mundan, and you know it."" He sounds as if he's chiding him, a familiar argument. He doesn't look angry, the way Emory was use to seeing folks being when they fought but sometimes people were tricky...

""What, by forcing our poor baby fawn to be bald? Oh the misery!"" Sirius swayed, making Emory feel a little sick as she clutched onto his t-shirt tightly in response. Her godfather's, (she assumed, they haven't told her, but then why would you tell a baby stuff like this anyway, they wouldn't understand normally) arms, weren't as muscular as James own. Her father- dad- da? Had muscles for days, while Sirius' strength came in his speed, his legs, his arms on the other hand were akin to twigs. 

""We aren't shaving your head padfoot,"" James scoffed, but his eyes twinkled, a little bit of the brightness alighting in them. ""Only made that mistake once."" 

""He thinks you got something from your past holding you down,"" Sirius mock whispered his stubble rubbing gently against her baby cheek. She still didn't laugh, even though for once she wanted to being reminded of her grandfather... ""So shaving you bald will get rid of all of that stuff from the past lives your soul lived."" 

""It's not as if Annaprasanam went as planned,"" James muttered more to himself then to the both of them but they could still hear him. She had no clue what the word that he spoke was, but by the way understanding dawned upon Sirius' face he seemed to know.

""Jamie, you couldn't have known that Harry would be this sickly as a baby... It's not your fault, okay? He's getting better-"" Sirius moved closer to James making something squirm in her stomach. James was crying again, having taken off his glasses, and rubbing frantically at his eyes. She wanted to be as far away from this as possible, she hated seeing him cry.


it made her think of herself, so easy to cry when alone yet a face of stone in front of others.


She instead found herself squished in the middle of a hug between best friends. While Emory wanted to be as far away from this breakdown as possible, she was far too tired to try to demand to be put down. ""Sure while it won't be the first solid food that Harry has ever eaten, it will be the first solid food that you haven't had to spell into his stomach. We just gotta convince him to eat a bit and show him that he won't throw it back up.""

She closed her eyes, feeling James tremble in the hug as Sirius pat his back with his one free arm.

""Pads I'm just so scared- Lily is too. What if something happens? I can't even let my son sleep in the nursery by himself because what if he stops breathing during the night? I can't sleep, I can barely eat some days. I want to take Harry to the healer but Dumbldore says it's too dangerous, and we don't have anyone in the order that specializes in child care!""

Sirius started to tremble too, but there was something sparking in the air, making it feel thick, reminding her of humid nights at home during the summers. It was dark, threatening to choke her, yet cool, as if smooth crisp water was being poured down her throat.

""Fuck Dumbdlore.""

Emory's eyes flicked open, practically bulging out of her head as she craned her head to try to look up at Sirius' face. His jaw was set, sticking it out in a rebellious way that she would've easily thought he'd done it all his life. Twin gasps reached their ears making her aware that Lily had just walked in, stray hairs fighting their way out of her ponytail. The dark eyebags were horrendous and she started to wonder just how long Lily had been brewing potions.

""Sirius..."" James murmured for the first time sounding, unsure of himself.

""I meant it,"" Sirius hissed, she could practically feel his hackles rising as he let James go. Emory for the first time realized Sirius towered over her father in height, just like Lily did. ""Fuck him- you two could go to a muggle doctor under polyjuice, none would be the wiser!""

James' jaw practically dropped to the floor in his shock as Sirius continued sounding as if he was gearing up for a rant of some sort.

""Look, I respected him, but after what happened in school, and this war- I... I can admit he let us get away with way too much over other students. I was a right prat, irresponsible too but he didn't even try to curve it and I've had to learn the hard way. I can't just watch you two kill yourselves over this either; worrying if Harry is going to live. We're adults, we can make our own choices! We don't need to look up to an adult, and ask if we can pretty please go outside. We never cared in school, so why do we fucking care now of all times? Why do we care what Dumbldore thinks when it's Harry's life that's on the line right now!""

""Oh dear god."" Lily looked like she was about to fall over and faint, be it from the potion fumes she had been working with or- or whatever the fuck was going on in this house because this was off script. This was way off fucking script because Sirius of all people was meant to be a staunch Dumbldore approver, he wasn't meant to say these things. To- to plant some seed of doubt in their brains, he was meant to never learn, to be a teenager stuck in his past, rot in jail for twelve years then die.

""Don't you dare think I haven't noticed why you've been holed up in your potions room Lily Potter,"" Sirius continued, patting Emory's back in comfort as he stalked over to Lily. James had apparently flopped into a chair as if his whole world had been twisted on it's axis. ""You've been trying to find some potion that could cure Harry. Well tough shit you don't know everything!""

Lily's eyes turned cold, lips pursed, nostrils flaring and Sirius steam rolled ahead while Emory felt her own heart beat far too fast in her fear of just what he was doing. ""You don't know everything, you aren't an all seeing God Lily because you are human. Human like me, human like your parents, like James. I can't believe I'm the one having to knock some sense into you both so here it is.""

He quickly backed away before Lily could swipe at him, standing in the middle of the room he jumped atop the coffee table, looking down at both Lily and James.

""It's okay to ask for help!"" He spoke, voice raised but not fully a shout, he continued. ""Jamie taught me that, and it looks like I have to teach him, and you all over again! What happened to the James that came to his friends first? What happened to the Lily that would take her mental health breaks because they were 'oh so important I've come to learn.' "" The last words Sirius had pitched his voice up, mocking Lily's own as he raised a brow towards them both.

The tempers were rising in the room, and Emory suddenly found herself whisked away from Sirius arms, into James, wand out and spells casted so fast that it happened in between a blink. She got the back end of a ""WHAT HAPPENED? YOU ASKED WHAT HAPPENED WELL I'LL TELL YOU-"" as Lily shouted at Sirius  and the man just took it. Whatever charm was up kept her from hearing their argument but she didn't hear the fake murmurs of people either so it wasn't the muffling charm...

""It's been a long day,"" James murmured into her hair. ""I think it's time for us both to take a nap, don't you think?""

For once, Emory couldn't agree more with him.

EDIT:

It was brought to my attention that I should've explained what Mundan and Annaprasanam are to those unaware. I am not desi, I simply did some research on google, and while I might not be knowledgeable with Hindu culture the times I do mention it I will have done research for the subject. 

Mundan: Is one of the ritual that's preformed on a baby's first birthday. Mundan is when you shave off all the hair on your baby's head. The shaving is believed to cleanse the child of any wrong doings carried over from a past life and allows the child a fresh start in this life. The priest will bless the barber and scatter the hair in the river as an offering

Annaprasanam: It's another ritual done though not necessarily on a first birthday it can be. It's where you give your baby their first solid foods. It's meant to signify the development of health in the baby.

We take a look through Sirius eyes to see what's happening in the inter mechanism of the marauders friendships. Old wounds seem to come to light, and suddenly maybe everything wasn't as stable as he had thought they were. All Sirius can do is hope he's not to late to save his friends, and their brotherly bond.

The sharp smell of alcohol would've overwhelmed him if he wasn't so use to it all. Sirius Black, like all men his age always liked a good drink. Though, before Harry was born he indulged far too much in drinks, pretty women and men alike until the reality that he was in a war shattered his ""playboy"" lifestyle. Playboy in quotation marks because he could, in the end, never find it in himself to go off and have sex with the people he wooed. Something always stopped him from fully going through it. Maybe he was broken, maybe he didn't want sex- hell if he knew what it was. He just always felt sick to his stomach, and wanted to go back home.

Back to Jamie.

Back to Lily-flower.

And after Harry was born, he found the idea of going to bars, to dance without his friends well... What was the point when they weren't all together? He sighed heavily into his drink, as Fleetwood Mac played over the old speakers. It sounded gritty, muffled, and one would have to struggle to hear over the murmuring of the other people in the bar. Thankfully or maybe not so, he had the sensitive hearing, (among other things) of a dog and was able to tune into the song.

He started to hum the tune, feeling something heavy in his chest as the crooning words, ""Find emerald eyes in the night, Gleamin' shiny and bright, As if covered with silverrrr! "" played over the speaker. 

He swayed in his seat, probably looking three sheets to the wind, utterly pissed drunk, murmuring to himself, ""Emerald eyes is a mystery; She's my place of serenity."" He didn't mind what anyone else thought, it would keep people from bothering him as he stewed over what happened today.  

""Back to your bar hopping, eh Padfoot?""

The voice snapped Sirius out of his slump revery, perking up as he saw Peter, and Remus draw closer. Remus easily cuts a pathway through the packed bar; it helped that even while calm, Remus had this wild air about him. He had been losing contact with him recently, the other seemingly falling into some thrall. Peter was hiding slightly behind Remus, which wasn't surprising, the other man didn't like bars or dancing, far more comfortable staying home.

""Not really,"" he huffed, moving the shot glass across the wood, sliding it back and forth between his hands. ""Just couldn't think of what to do, was bored ya know?""

""Is this about Harry,"" Peter said, his sky blue eyes looking far to knowing. He hated that about Peter, the bloke was far too observant for his own good with zero filter when he got talking. 

His face scrunched up at the comment, feeling something twisting in his chest at the call out. 'I liked it better when you were silent.' The sharp retort was on the tip of his tongue, only to die in his throat as Peter looked at him with... Not accusing eyes as he had always assumed to go along with his blunt tone of voice. The man seemed to generally want to know if it was about Harry.

Remus sighed, greenish brown eyes flashing a familiar amber, signaling how close to the surface the wolf was, his shoulders relaxing when Sirius didn't lash out. And it was funny- the more he started to think of everything going on around him, the more he realized that, in his pursuit to be nothing like his parents, that he hurt his friends during it. That he was pushing his friends away when all he wanted to do was hold them closer.

It was probably why Peter was so silent now as an adult, why he never spoke about what was going on inside his head because Sirius had always seen it as a weakness to show worry or sadness. He would always get awkward when the younger boy cried, or lashed out at him for it or even for things that Sirius was starting to realize he had put in the other boy's mouth. Peter just never seemed to realize why he shouldn't ask people some questions until someone explained it to him. Not that his best mate was stupid, but it was bizar how one moment he was pants with most school related things, then he'd say something so profound that it twists your head round the bend. 

""Yes,"" Sirius replied, having promised himself he would be better. Though his voice was still clipped, drawing a snort from Remus as he slid into the booth across from him, Peter quickly joined them, still looking tentative.

""Has he gotten worse or..."" The blond trailed off, nervously picking at his fingernail looking away from him, unable to meet his eye as he asked. Remus was talking to the waiter, ordering his drinks then some water for Peter, though the way Remus tilted his head showed he was listening as well.

""No, it's still the same. Refuses to eat, has to have food spelled into his stomach, Lily's been experimenting with nutrient potions ever since Harry was born. They've mixed it in with the food they spell into his stomach and his body is getting stronger. They just haven't figured out why he won't eat..."" 

He trailed off, having more to say but he wasn't sure if Lily even knew yet. James would have to know through his superior sense of smell, was probably waiting for her to come to him about it. It really wasn't his right to talk about it if-

Remus' nose wrinkled, brows furrowing as he gave him a knowing look. Peter looked like he was already zoning out, a frown on his face. His button nose wasn't twitching but it was a close thing as he leaned forward, resting his cheek into the palm of his hand. He was obviously thinking about something, but what he didn't know.

""Why do you smell pregnant,"" Peter blurted out, before his face turned white at his words swiftly covering his mouth as if he could stuff said words back down his throat.

Sometimes Sirius really wished he wasn't surrounded by animagus and a werewolf; it made keeping secrets hard unless they remembered to cast scent stifling spells.

With a heavy sigh, face planting into the wooden table with a low groan. He'd already been chewed out by Lily once today; he didn't need this to become a repeat act. 

""I doubt Pads the one that's pregnant,"" Remus drly responded raising a brow at him before glancing at Peter who looked confused. ""Pete, he hasn't suddenly grown the parts needed for it, it's obviously Lily's scent."" 

Peter blinked owlishly, looking from Remus to Sirius, lips parted in a little 'oh' before exclaiming ""what, again?"" 

""You calling her a slag wormtail,"" Sirius growled, lifting his head from the table feeling defensive. Peter gave him a confused look, whilst Remus grumbled into his glass of whiskey the waiter had just dropped off, quickly leaving when the word slag was thrown out sensing an impending fight. 

""What?? No I didn't say that,"" Peter seemed to backtrack looking at Sirius as if he was the one who had a few screws loose. ""Look I can't imagine that there's not a lot for them to do cooped up in the house, but shouldn't they- they uh, shouldn't they slow down?""

And with Peter's explanation any itching for a fight, no matter how pathetic died a quick death as the anxiety was obvious in Peter's face. He glanced from Sirius, then to Remus, speaking slowly as if to make sure he got the words out correctly. ""Not that I'm not happy for them, but one baby is a lot of stress. You've been telling me how sick Harry is, and that his magic was the only thing keeping him going in the early days."" 

Sirius tried not to glare at Remus, having been unable to contact him and having had to rely on Peter for a shoulder to cry on during that time. Which was very difficult to do. Not because Peter wouldn't listen, but there was always something fragile about him. He always felt guilty having to tell Peter, who was already stressing over the war, his mum, and his prick of a dad that boasted about taking down death eaters, but would turn right back around and treat his muggle wife like shit. Irony wasn't even the first word Sirius thought of, when he thought of Mr. Pettigrew.

""Isn't another new baby a bad idea when Harry isn't even out of the woods yet,"" Peter continued, having noticed the silent conversation that Sirius and Remus were having. ""Guys don't do that,"" he snapped, making both men jump in their seats from the almost shout, stopping them from glaring.

Peter's face was flushed red, making his face look ruddy, his annoyance clear as day. ""I-"" there was a pause as he shook, he looked parts scared and parts angry yet also determined in a way Sirius had rarely seen. ""I- I can't stand when you do that! Those silent arguments an other bullcrap. Or  the way you two leave me out of the loop because you think poor little wormy can't handle it- well no shit I can't handle it because you guys don't warn me about what's happening! It... it makes me feel like-""

Oh fuck.

Peter was crying, his round face screwed up in pain as fat tears rolled down his cheeks, taking in sharp breaths, fingers gripping the table as if it was his only support. ""It makes me feel like you guys don't like me, you know? I- I know im stupid, it's okay you don't have to tell me I've heard it all in Hogwarts. That i'm just some little lump of a boy following around real wizards an taking credit for things you do, riding on your coat tails.""

""You aren't-"" Sirius hissed feeling anger bubble up in his chest at the insult- the multiple insults. 

Peter only laughed at him, wiping his eyes while shaking his head. ""Sirius I'm fucking fat, and I didn't get the best grades until Remus started tutoring me. I'm not blind. What did you think people were going to think of me? I'm always going to be fat first, a person second. Everyone in the order already thinks I gorge myself on the rashings at the safe houses anyway."" 

""Who called you all that- I'll- I'll!"" He didn't know what he would do but it would be something. Something that would make his teenage self proud. That probably wasn't a good thing

""You did.""

What.

""What,"" Sirius spoke, baffled from Peter's admittance.

""You and James both, you didn't call me a lump specifically but you both use to tease me about my weight all the time in school."" Peter looked terrified at his own admittance, but some heavy weight seemed to fall from his shoulders, letting go of something that must have been weighing down on him. He went from hunched over, to a straightened spine. ""You made fun of how long it took me to do my school work until Remus got you to stop, and apologize. That was in second year.""

""I- Peter I'm sorry,"" Sirius crocked out, all of his worries seemingly to come to the light. More wrong doings that he had unknowingly committed against his friends. Memories that he couldn't for the life of him place but knew it had to be true. It chilled him to the bone, because he knew he didn't remember it because to him it was just another day.

""I knew you two didn't mean it in a- a mean way that you wanted me to hurry up so we could hang out together, but it still hurt. It still hurts me now because you're meant to be my friends and you made me- made me feel lesser than you.."" 

The obvious 'I can't forgive you yet"" was clear in his eyes.

There was a long silence between them all, as Remus and Peter pretend not to see Sirius silently cry knowing the man wouldn't appreciate it. James was the only one he'd ever let him watch cry, and in a way this was a bigger step for the three of them. Not that they would know how important this moment would be in the future. It was surely a big step for Sirius at the very least, as normally anything like this would have him reacting like a scared dog backed in a corner, lunging forward to bite whatever was trying to trap him before running off in the chaos.

""It was McGonagall, wasn't it,"" Remus asked the question, clearly rhetorical as through his blurry teary eyes Sirius could see that the werewolf didn't seem surprised by his own words just tired.

""W-Well not those exact words,"" Peter stuttered, ringing his hands together looking ashamed of himself for speaking. Which Sirius didn't like. ""She was at Rosmerta's, talking to- um I didn't recognize who, I think it was her brother or someone that was visiting her. An I was in my you know what so she didn't know. She- uh she said I had um, separation issues, and that I needed to learn to be separate from you guys. So I could be my own person so I don't use you guys as a crutch in the real world. She wasn't sure if I could get a job either because of my anxiety with strangers. It wasn't the, you know, best thing for a kid to hear especially when I already thought that all the teachers were talking behind my back about me.""

""That- that-"" Sirius huffed, and puffed feeling a sense of betrayal from it all. The older woman he had playfully flirted with as a joke, the woman he looked up to as one of those few adults that tentatively gained his trust. The only other woman beating her out was James' own mother, the woman swiftly gaining his respect for her strength and pure stubbornness. 

His heart still ached at her loss.

""So that's why she split you up from us during fifth year,"" Remus murmured, more to himself then not. It all made perfect sense really, the three of them had all assumed it was a punishment to break up the gang even though it was mainly Peter that got the short end of the stick.

""That was the year where I had the worst grades ever,"" Peter sighed heavily, sounding tired just from thinking of that not so fun time in his life. Contrary to popular belief they didn't do Wormy's homework for him, Remus just had a good way of explaining things to him that seemed to help get the gears moving. ""I mean maybe she was a little bit right- I uh, never really made friends outside of you guys, and I honestly don't know how to. I don't really want too either an I guess that's a bad thing?""

""It doesn't matter if she was right or not, she was hypocritical,"" Sirius painfully admitted, watching as Peter's jaw dropped. Even Remus, who so far had been mainly quiet, looked surprised by Sirius' own words in Peter's defense. Was he the only one that was realizing things? Who was thinking about everything that had happened? He loved Minnie, he really did, she was the best teacher. To him, at least, maybe to others like Peter they felt differently. 

""She never broke me and James up in school; she let us stay together unless we had done something really disruptive. Then we would have detentions apart, but even then we had the mirrors. We would talk the whole way through it an while we're good at keeping secrets, she had to have figured out something was going on but never said anything. She never separated Remus from us either, it was just you-""

""I probably got off because I looked like a poor sick Victorian child,""  Remus shrugged, dragging a surprised snort from Peter. ""Who could say no to my large sunken in eyes? Surely not her knowing that I had never talked with a child my age since I was four.""

""If anyone has attachment issues out of all of us, it's Sirius with James mate,"" Peter sorted, rolling his eyes as he teased turning his face to Sirius'. ""I mean ever since you  became their secret keeper you're practically half living in that house now. Next thing we know Harry's gonna call you dad first then call James by his name.""

Sirius couldn't help himself, he laughed, a loud barking laugh that had caused a slight hush to fall over the bar. The noise only picked back up as Remus looked out to the sea of faces with a raised brow, making others flinch at the sight of his heavily scarred face. Sirius just couldn't stop laughing, real tears running down his cheeks because- because-

""PETE I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D GET THE BALLS TO JOKE LIKE THAT,"" he howled, smacking his hand on the table top as Peter flushed, this time looking pleased with himself before joining in, chuckling softly at the sight of Sirius' red face. It took a while but his laughter soon came to an end, slowly tapering off until he was breathing heavily, rubbing at his eyes while Remus seemed to take up the mother hen role since James wasn't here by handing them napkins. A peaceful silence fell over them all as they drank their drinks slowly, the air cleared, and mood looking up. He basked in it all, the closeness, the togetherness, all they were missing was James and Lily then it'd be like old times.

""Since we're all together again,"" Sirius began feeling a familiar warmth of alcohol flood his veins. ""You guys gonna show up for Harry's first birthday.""

Peter said, yes of course, but Remus looked conflicted at he question. The look on his face spoke of something... Sirius knew Remus was keeping some secret from them all, he didn't know what it was, but the change in his friend was obvious. There were new scars that he tried to hide with his longer sleeves not to mention being in the same room with Remus gave Sirius the distinct feeling of being in the same room as a predator. That the wolf was right under the surface, and was wondering the fastest way to snap their necks an have a feast.

It didn't scare him as much as one would expect. He had played with the wolf under the full moon, there was no going back from that.

'You'll be coming too, won't you Remus?' He silently thought while watching his friend, grey eyes turning stormy. He wanted so badly to trust him, but the sliver of doubt was there, the way he was pushing them all away again like it was their second year of Hogwarts all over again. He didn't know what was happening, but he had to figure it out before he lost his friend to this war.

""I will,"" Remus muttered into his drink, taking a deep drink of the rest of his whiskey before smacking the glass back down.

""Good,"" Sirius sighed, smiling at his old friend, and letting Peter's chatter about what books he's read, of cooking with his mother, and how he had found a job at a muggle bookstore. He let the others' voice be used as whitenoise for his mind, nodding along and smiling watching as Peter seemed to flourish under his half attention unaware his mind was somewhere.

Sadly, the good mood was lost.

It's Emory's first birthday in this new world, an unexpected mile stone. With the ticking clock to her new families demise hanging over their heads she's not sure if she can handle the stress of it all. Her half baked plans might come to a broil, especially when she learns that she has some special guest at her party...

Emory was awakened from her midday nap to a shout, Sirius bursting through the front door, claiming that he had to liven the place up a bit given that it was ""Harry's"" birthday and- 

""Shame on you Prongsy! You've barely decorated the place. What will Harry think when he sees this?""

""He's turning one he won't remember it,"" Lily replied drily, her voice easily carrying in the silence that followed. 

Emory struggled to get her body to work with her, rolling over on her side while trying to sit up. Now awake, she knew she wouldn't be able to go back to sleep anytime soon. Not that Sirius ever learned what quiet meant anyway. She was going to pee on him, if she could get the damn magical diaper off of her. He had planted the idea of going against Dumbledore, not that, that was bad- but now they were actually thinking of taking her to a doctor! (which was honestly much worse in her opinion then the Dumbledore thing) They were talking about having Peter and Remus polyjuice as themselves just in case someone came by which she didn't get, weren't they meant to be left alone?? Then again she guessed they still got letters, or messages from Dumbledore maybe? Though wouldn't the old man figure them out since he's been alive for a century?

There were a lot of questions, like how Remus and Peter were meant to get in, and if Peter had already started spying yet. She wasn't sure if she could stomach being around the disgusting rat man. All she could see when thinking of Peter was the warty infested looking pathetic excuse of a man from the movies. She might try to trigger her accidental magic to point Peter out as a traitor then maybe it could all work out and she'd be able to save them.

Rocking on her butt, she moved side to side, swaying as she waited for them to finish talking. When they still went at it she wondered if she could show her ""progress"" in speaking to her parents to get their attention...

She started to babble, listening as the loud voices downstairs turned hushed, amazed at the fact of how much control she had over them. She wasn't even trying to talk at all; she was only making normal baby sounds. As she continued going ""TA! TA! BA!"" smacking her hands together, she could hear pounding footsteps race up the stairs. She watched in mild amusement as James and Sirius got stuck in the bedroom doorway, pushing and shoving to get to her while Lily was watching from behind them with her green eyes twinkling in amusement.

""Ba!"" She yelled, gaining their attention, they watched her seemingly awestruck, and she had to admit it was a stroke to her ego. The fact that they were so amazed by such a simple ""achievement"" of hers. If she wasn't planning on kicking the bucket soon she'd have thought maybe she'd be more confident in this life. Maybe she would try to be one of those wonder babies and instead of saying one word she'd wait until she could say a full sentence clearly...

""Ba!"" She said, much softer tone while she pulled against the crib railing signaling she wanted out.

""Guys- do you think we could get him to say Papa?"" James asked, eyes still locked on her tiny form as if she was a miracle. He was practically jumping in place, clapping his hands together in his joy, ignoring the fact she was asking to be let out. ""Or da, would da be easier for him?""

""I think we should get him to say Padfoot,"" Sirius teased, bumping James with his elbow causing the other man to mock scowl at him.

""His first word is not going to be Padfoot!""

""BAAAAAA,"" she yelled again, shaking the side of the crib while glaring at James who was... He was looking at her with so much love, the realization took her breath away, making her stutter. Her baby body couldn't handle the sudden breath of air, making her choke, and thus ruining what soft moment they had as Lily pushed through the two men, rushing to her crib, quickly picking her up, and solidly patting her back. Emory coughed, struggling to breath for a moment, crying against Lily's shoulder and soaking her t-shirt in her tears.

""Oh baby, it's okay don't stress yourself out. You're amazing Harry, we're so proud of you, you're so brave."" Lily cooed, rubbing her back. Her traitorous body, soothed by it's mother's touch and warm voice seemed to grow liquid-y, and heavy as her eyes closed.

""Besides boys,"" Lily whispered, looking over at her husband, and Sirius with a mischievous look twinkling in her eye. ""Harry's first words will obviously be Mama, isn't that right my sweet little pumpkin!"" Emory only grumbled, smacking her lips as she let Lily hold her for once where she'd normally struggle, and try to escape. It wasn't that bad actually, Lily normally smelled like potion fumes but today she smelled like something sweet and sugary. Hiding her nose in the crook of Lily's neck she sniffled, the sugary smell stronger.

Unbeknownst to her, James had rushed out to grab the camera while Sirius fondly watched Lily, his eyes softening at the sight. Lily continued to soak up this moment with her son, her lips pulled into a small smile. Glancing up at Sirius with misty eyes, from being able to hold her son comfortably. 

""We should get him dressed, shouldn't we,"" Lily softly asked, giggling as James quietly tried to run back into the room, the camera in his hand. He started to quickly take pictures, the snapping a bit loud but one that Emory ignored. 

""Sirius you got the clothes, didn't you,"" James asked between pictures looking like a love struck fool as he did so. 

""Course I did mate, what type of friend would I be if I forgot?"" 

Cracking an eye open, Emory turned her head and watched as Sirius pulled out the outfit, the pants looked really puffy gold color, while the shirt was a red with golden accents in shapes she couldn't describe. Calling them squiggles felt offensive somehow. The black shoes had a pointed tip with what she thought was a ribbon down the middle of the toe. They looked to be very traditional clothes, though James Gryffindor bias was shining clearly in the coloring choices.

""Oh they are so cute,"" Lily squealed making Emory scowl, hiding her face once again and grumbling.

Maybe not just James' own bias then.

She resisted the best she could, but it was futile when James looked at her with tired eyes. The guilt started to worm it's way into her heart, glancing from Lily, then to James. As James' smile looked more strained, the longer this ""fight"" went on. She couldn't look at them, letting herself slowly accept what was happening just like how she had to accept when Lily would bath her in the sink.

""There we go little man, it wasn't that hard, now was it?"" Lily cooed as James seemed to come back to life, the strained smile turning to a real one. He still looked tired, but pleased that they had managed it without much of a fight on her end. 

""Go on Lils, we should get dressed- not the colorful clothes though this is Harry's day one of the muted colored ones!"" He seemed to be talking more to himself as he set Harry's feet onto the ground laughing as her legs wobbled. He kept bouncing her up and down in place, his large callused hands holding her tiny own. She gripped his fingers tightly, as tightly as her little baby fingers would allow. It was getting harder and harder not to laugh at it all, he played with her like he was a little kid. 

Her legs were still weak but even before the failure of the starvation project she had been trying to learn how to walk as fast as she could. The texture of the carpet on her body as she had been left to lay on the floor on one of those blanket things, with stuff dangling over her was atrocious, even now when she's in her baby play pin she swears she can feel the damnable thing. If she was forced to crawl across the carpet one more time she'd a bloody fit! 

Oh no- not bloody, ew British words!

""Okay- James I got a surprise for you and Lily, I know it's Harry's birthday, but we'll think of this as being a gift for him too,"" Sirius called out, winking in their direction before racing down the hall. The sound of the front door met her ears, and while she had no clue what he was up to she wasn't that worried. She really should've been, as James sent a look over her head to Lily, who then shrugged after having grabbed whatever clothes they would be changing into later that day. Emory found herself being picked up by her father and brought downstairs only to be met at the open front door with two men who were oddly enough blindfolded. Emory didn't recognize them at all, but Sirius' hands were on their backs leading them deeper into the house, closing and locking the door behind himself. 

James gasped at the sight of them, gently handing her over to Lily as he took a few steps towards the men staring at them in a sense of disbelief and wonder.

""You came,"" his voice cracked, making something strange squirm in her stomach as she really stared at these men to take them in with more detail. 

One was tall, lanky, almost like Sirius but way taller than Sirius could ever hope to be. He had blond-ish brown hair and even with half his face covered the scars upon him were ghastly. His skin was tan-ish as if he was in the sun all day, and he gave off a strange- withheld vibe that she couldn't just place, just that something made the hair on the back of her neck raise up at the sight of him.

The other man was fat, shorter than James which was an accomplishment in itself as her father was five foot five. (In the books it had been theorized Harry was short due to malnutrition and while she imagined it didn't help, she had a feeling in this life she'd just be as tall as her dad) He had a round face, and as he smiled she spotted that he had two buck teeth just like she had when she was a kid in her old life. His hair was a pure blond, the shade that made her think would be the envy of every popular girl ever. He looked excited, his fingers twitching in a familiar way she would do when she was happy about something but trying not to stim. Whoever this was they seemed really excited to see her dad.

Then the blind folds were taken off, both men looking confused, and disoriented for a split second, cross eyed before everything seemed to settle.

""That's bloody weird,"" The taller man said, his dark green eyes striking in the low light. ""Hey Pete, you think our mum's felt like this when we had to lead them to diagon alley? Standing in a building they knew didn't look right.""

Emory's stomach dropped  at the name, her head whipping towards, 'Pete.' Oh god it was Peter and Remus. How could she be so dense!? Who else would her dad be so happy to see besides them!? What the fuck where they doing here!? Was this canon, did they come to celebrate Harry's first birthday in the books- what the fuck what the fuck whatwhahthw-

Peter only laughed, a sound that was strained, his sky blue eyes looked pained at the question. Was it his eternal guilt about what he was going to do this October eating him up? The smile on his lips looked very fake proving to her one thing. Just because Peter wasn't some ugly slimy thing from the abyss he still was the traitor of this story. Though what was he doing with a mom that was a muggle? Didn't his wiki page say he was a pureblood?

""Remus,"" Sirius scowled, hissing lowly not looking too happy at the question aimed at their friend. She wouldn't know why, it was a valid question. A look of realization seemed to dawn on Remus face, before replaced with guilt- whatever it was about well it didn't matter this guy was a traitor he didn't deserve sympathy.

Peter hadn't answered, which she would've found suspicious if not for the fact that he wasn't given the chance too. Instead having been practically bulldozed over by her father as he picked the smaller man up, and hugged him with such strength he squeaked! He sounded just like a rat too, the high pitch squeaks she was familiar with on cute rat compilations as they would hop around and play together.

Her face was twitching, she could feel something foreign building up in her throat. An undercurrent of fear welled up inside of her as she thought she was about to throw up.  it's not as if it was new, she had tried to get into the habit of throwing up her food after it was spelled into her but it was exhausting to do. As she opened her mouth, a reaction born of being used to voicing that something was wrong instead of her puking, crying or anything else she had been use to doing.

Emory, for the first time in this life laughed.

She laughed, a baby squeal that filled up the living room, and with that one simple action suddenly the room had gone to chaos.

A jump into Peter's mind shows that there is more than meets the eye with everyone's most hated character. Emory on the other hand finally caves in, and lets herself have fun, just for once... It doesn't go as planned, of course, as if anything ever does.

'Is it pathetic of me to be flattered by a baby?'

Was the first question on Peter's mind, having felt his face go red in embarrassment as he was the center of attention. He tried to pass it off as fully James- he never liked the spotlight in the first place it made him anxious. But, it seemed his best mate wasn't having any of it, claiming that Harry had been watching him. He was right too. Even now It wasn't hard to notice the baby's eyes planted firmly upon him watching him with eyes that mirrored Lily's own green. 

He didn't know how to treat babies, and had never seen one or held one really. He especially didn't get to hold Harry. He didn't hold it against James or Lil's though, maybe he would've if they had let everyone else have a go, but those two where fiercely protective over their new born son especially when news had gotten back that he was ill.

He thought about asking his mum how she took care of him, and made sure he stayed alive. He knew he was a sickly baby too, had almost died a few times before he was even walking and talking. Then again he didn't want to bring up bad memories for her, he knew she wasn't doing well now that he didn't live in the house with her. He didn't want to cause her more pain by showing up accidentally while his father was around. He just wished she would move out with him, he had cried, and sworn he could protect her from their father. She didn't believe him, of course. He was little baby Peter, weak, helpless to do anything, his only worth being a distraction. He was the protected, never the protector.

He wondered what Marlene would think, seeing him like this? The familiar worry for a girl who- at one time was a crush and another time he thought the only other friend he had besides the marauders. He wasn't sure if she thought they were friends, but he liked her and after that talk in the bar he had started to talk to her more growing closer, until that attack on her family that left her in a coma. There was something that niggled at the back of his brain, something that made him frown but he didn't know what it was. A memory? A feeling- something deeply important which made his gut twist. He shook his head to shoo away the more negative thoughts that tried to worm their way in and ruin the moment. He watched Harry, a familiar warmth welling up inside of his chest. He was still laughing, the baby's body shaking with the force of it. James was openly sobbing, his grin so wide that he swore it would've cracked his face. He had fallen to the floor upon his knees, rubbing his face against his sons in his utter joy at the sound of his baby's first laugh. He wouldn't be surprised if Harry was still laughing because of how James' five o'clock shadow was tickling his skin.

The fact that he- Peter Pettigrew had made the normally silent Harry Potter laugh filled his heart up with joy. He hadn't done anything special, just squeaked after having the air knocked out of him by James' muscular arms. His gut was feeling a bit sore as well, because as soon as  Harry laughed- James had squeezed him again, making him squeak louder this time in a little bit of distress (not that he would tell his best mate that) which only made Harry laugh harder at the sounds he made. He had quietly fallen to the background as Sirius, and James practically smothered the toddler in love. His eye had caught Remus doing the same, standing behind the couch as if he needed a physical barrier between him and Harry, making him frown at the action.

""Are you okay,"" Lily quietly asked, having walked over to him after she had smothered her son and husband in kisses. She was just as thoughtful as ever, her red rimmed eyes flicking towards his stomach. Normally he'd brush her off, tell her he was okay because this is just how things were they didn't need to worry about him too when they had Harry to take care of. 

But, tonight...

""A-Actually,"" he stammered having paused, staring at her nose to give the impression he was making eye contact. "" Um- James might've bruised me up a bit."" She frowned, her brows furrowing in worry as he laughed, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Lily it's okay I'm not going to die or anything. James has always been a bit strong.""

""Still he should be more careful,"" she muttered, clicking her tongue. ""It's okay I have some potions for that- let me go get them.""

It felt nice, not keeping everything to himself for once.

Lily came back with the potion he needed, subduing the pain and he was finally able to jump back in with the other guys. They hadn't noticed that he had pulled away, or they did and didn't say anything. They were opening gifts, and Sirius' was first,  because of course Sirius had to be first as he always was. So with a laugh he watched as James tried to get Harry to try to open the obviously broom shaped gift. The toddler didn't seem to give it a glance, having turned his head to watch him again. He laughed nervously, as Harry kept staring which- okay it was just a baby, a little kid but man with Lily's eyes he looked intense as if staring straight into his soul. 

""Haaarrryyyy,"" Sirius whined, looking like a kicked puppy at being ignored. The laughter by now had stopped and said baby had gone back to scowling, nose scrunched up as if smelling something unpleasant. Which is ridiculous, how could a baby look like it felt such distaste?

""It's okay pads he's probably still tuckered out from all the laughing.""

And without a second thought, James ripped open the gift gleefully, Lily groaning at the sight of the tiny broom.

Oh this was going to be a mess. He didn't need to be a seer to know that. He supposed the best he could do is sit back and watch the chaos unfold around him.

-

Emory decided that this was going to be a nightmare when James gleefully shouted before swinging her up, and around before plopping her bottom on the broom. The other presents she had were long forgotten in the face of the toy broom. It was by far the weirdest sensation, as if she was sitting on an invisible bike seat. Her hands subconsciously gripped the handle of the broom, having been startled only to cause her to zoom forward, much to James and Sirius' glee. The toy broom couldn't have been going that fast as James was keeping up with her but to her it felt like she was on a roller coaster. Her blood pumping, adrenaline high over taking her senses. There were whoops and hollers as she found the world around her blurring. Her hands were shaking as she kept trying to keep herself from running into anything. A yowl was heard and she barely realized she almost ran over Elvendork-

""Harry watch out!"" Lily called out trying to race after him him only to trip over the cat and that had been a shock to her system when she had first met Elvendork a few weeks ago; having the ginger pug faced cat lick her tears away Noticing a stand with a large floral vase upon it, she swerved to avoid it, managing to run straight into Remus' legs, making him yelp. Stumbling backwards it seemed the vase she had tried to avoid ended up breaking anyway, falling to the ground with a resounding crack. It shattered, sending flower petals and pieces scattering across the floor. 

She ended up flying from her broom, landing on top of Remus. It wasn't a soft landing by any means, as the man was boney as if he hadn't eaten for weeks, but it was better than landing in the ceramic pieces. She let herself lay there for a moment, her face smushed up against the man's chest, she felt him stiffen under her. His heart was beating rapidly, as if terrified that she was this close to him, was sitting on top of him. 



She hadn't noticed that he was bleeding, but Peter did as his voice seemed to cut through the chaos, stating the obvious with a pained, ""Remus, you're bleeding!""

Looking up, she met green eyes for a split second before they were over taken by a rush of gold, making her own widen at the sight. Sure she had been around magic, but she hadn't seen it in much action. There was the odd sense that this wasn't the Remus she had met a few minutes ago, something shining in his eyes. His head tilted, nose sniffing the air around her, if she didn't know he was a werewolf it wouldn't been really creepy. It seemed while James was trying to clean up the vase, and Lily had ran off to get some healing potion or whatever was used she and Remus were in a silent staring match. Peter had come over of course, but he seemed just as woefully unprepared to be faced with the task of trying to pick up a baby as he hovered over the both of them.

He looked more scared of her then she was of him! That would make two people terrified of her.

There was a rumble that caused Sirius to stiffen, her godfather had watched, apparently in amusement, that Remus was terrified of touching her. He was probably going to make the other man squirm for it- but now at a quick glance there was something different in his eyes. Her heart that had been beating in her ears, feeling like prey under his sharp gaze, roared as the man's thin arm wrapped around her body, holding her close, as if he had held a child like her a million times before so very unlike the lanky, awkward and exhausted Remus she had met before.

""Moony,"" Sirius spoke, there was no hint of warning like she expected, just surprise in her godfathers voice as Remus sat up with her in his arms. Even Peter looked on in open shock, having pulled out his wand to vanish the thin trails of blood upon his arms. The rumble grew louder, it wasn't a growl- it honestly made her think of the chuffing sound tigers would make. Still it made a shiver go up her spine reminding her of something wild. 

She watched him, staring into his eyes, almost lost in the golden pools. They were beautiful, a shimmering color that made her think of sunny days and home. Unable to help herself, she reached up, patting his scarred cheek.

Remus smiled at her, the look filled with such warmth that she hadn't realized had been missing from the green eyes she had seen. His green eyes had been filled with fear, anxiety and probably so many other things she couldn't name in one go. But, his golden eyes were just filled with love, unabashed care, a tenderness that she had mainly seen from her parents, and Sirius. The eye contact was broken as the man set his chin on top of her head, causing a confused sound to leave her. He started to rub his chin, and jaw against the top of her head, musing up the black curls she had. She continued to voice her confusion the best she could, turning only to find Sirius, whose posture looked relaxed holding a camera.

""Oh merlin look at him-,"" he snickered, the snap from the camera making her blink owlishly up at him. ""He looks like his eyes are going to pop out of his skull!"" Sirius elbowed Peter, making the other man wheeze from the suddenness of it. 

""Oi, Oi!"" James' voice came from behind Remus, with a mock scowl on his face as he loomed over them. ""You scent marking my child? He's not yours, I worked hard for him!""

""You worked hard for him,"" Lily's dry, annoyed voice made her turn to look at her as she walked in, brow raised. James sheepishly laughed while both Peter and Sirius snickered at their friend's position. ""I don't remember you carrying him for nine months. If you really want to work for it maybe we should use that spell I found to give you a chance."" 

James flustered, flapping his arms and squawking, Sirius and Peter howling as the man was left wrong footed by his own wife.

""Hello Moony,"" Lily spoke, drawing the wolf's attention to her. It had to be the wolf, Remus hadn't wanted to touch her, he looked frightened as if, if he touched her he would end up shattering her in a million pieces. She supposed wolves didn't have the same fear, able to feel the happy sound of his rumbles reverberating through his chest.

""I have a potion for you,"" she continued, having slowly crouched down to be on the same level as him. He snorted, giving her the stink eye as he held her a bit tighter then she would like.

""You can't lick your wounds you're not as flexible like this,"" Lily pointed out as if she knew what Remus/Moony was saying even though he hadn't spoken once.

She took out her wand, which was long, a bit twisted at the tip, the wood a light color as she easily pulled what little fragments Remus had gotten stuck in his arms. Then lightly she placed potion soaked bandages upon his arms which healed the cuts right up. With a light sigh, she stood up, getting Remus to stand up as well, still holding her possessivly in his arms. 

Well, quite frankly this was bizarre. She had never been held by anyone else besides her parents, and Sirius. She liked the view being in Moony's arms gave her, as even Lily, who was taller then James by many inches wasn't as tall as Moony. She felt that she was on top of the world, looking down at everyone else which reminded her of the height that she would never have in this life.

""I think that's enough excitement for today. Me and James will get changed, why don't the three of you go into the kitchen. We have everything set up-"" She cut herself off, sending a sharp glare to Sirius, ""and don't you dare touch the cake we have set up!""

Sirius raised his arms in the air in mock submission, ""Whoa Lily flower! I'm not going to ruin Harry's birthday."" She pursed her lips, rolling her eyes, before turning to Moony, placing a quick kiss to his forehead, having to stand on her tip toes to reach before going towards the stairs, James following behind her. He must have said something funny because she caught the sound of laughter, the sound fading as the three other men settled down in the kitchen. 

""Moony, you're going to have to set Harry in his highchair,"" Sirius pointed out though she's not sure if he did it because he wanted him to do it, or to gain the annoyed huff from the wolf.

""It's been a really long time since we've seen you like this, how are you,"" Peter asked, his fingernail drawing patterns in the warm wood of the kitchen table. The man watched Moony in deep interest, his eyes flicking to her every few seconds.

Emory wasn't even sure if Moony could speak, so when he did she was left shocked again. (Annoyingly enough Sirius had taken another picture, and this one would show both her shock and Remus/Moony's' annoyance)

""Difficult."" Moony' voice was worn, as if the man hadn't talked for years, a low gravelly sound. ""Remus is a stupid man."" 

""Well, never say that anyone's perfect,"" Peter sighed shaking his head, hiding his face in his hand.

""Remus is a fool,"" the wolf went on insulting his other half His host?, seemingly ignoring Peter's words or using this as a way to add onto them. ""He is a fool that listens to those not of pack. I mourn our times apart, he claims this is better for us all. My soul aches."" 

Suddenly the mood turned somber, both Peter and Sirius glancing at each other, before looking to Moony. They both looked like they wanted to say something, or ask the wolf something but weren't sure if they should. Moony seemed to take control, adding on, ""Old man has claimed Remus' work is better for-""

Suddenly, Moony's head started twitching frantically, hitting the side of his shoulder repeatedly as if having an eternal battle with himself. She was quickly whisked away into Peter's arms, and maybe if she wasn't terrified of the thought that Remus was having a seizure she might've bitten his hand. Instead she watched as his golden eyes dimmed the green fighting control over the other as he was flailing into his seat. Sirius raced forward, holding Remus down the best he could whisper hissing, ""don't- don't do this Remus, come on.""

Peter turned her body away from what was happening, keeping her from seeing anything more. She heard the way the chair shook, Sirius hissing, Lily and James racing down dressed in new clothes that she knew matched her own in ways colors that were a bit more muted, yet still so beautiful. 'Is that what a sari is,' her brain silently commented even as the tensions in the room grew higher.

A snarl was ripped from Remus' throat, the booming voice of Moony's last resolve screaming out, ""YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO HIDE REMUS LUPIN THEY ARE PACK."" 

Then, all was silent.

She shouldn't be surprised when Remus came too; he looked furious, but along with that terrified of himself. His hands were shaking as he glared at both Peter and Sirius, Peter withered from the look, yet even as he shrunk he hid her with him, instead of leaving her in the path of the full glare while Sirius' eyes gained a hardened light to them. Even Lily and James could only watch as Sirius confronted Remus as if in shock of what was happening right before their eyes. 

""It's Dumbledore, isn't it.""

Remus didn't answer, instead standing on shaking legs, his nostrils flaring. ""That is none of your business,"" he hissed starting to back out from the room. 

Sirius chased after him like a dog with a bone. ""It is our business! He's using you to spy on the wolf packs isn't he!?""

Emory blinked, feeling guilt twist her stomach. She had forgotten that all this time Remus was out there, following the headmaster's orders. She could only wonder how it felt, doing something that terrified you, but feeling the need you had too.

""Just because he gave you a place at school doesn't mean you owe him anything,"" Sirius continued unknowingly echoing Emory's own thoughts, stalking forward,  even as Remus looked like the other man had slapped him with a fish. ""He treated you with basic human decency! You deserved to go to school no matter what- just because he asked you to run a fools mission doesn't mean you have to- do you think James was stupid enough to give Dumbldore his cloak? Or, even let the man know about it!""

Emory didn't have time to think about the implications of Dumbldore not having James cloak, wide and wary eyes turning from Sirius to Remus whoes face twisted into something sour at being called a fool, lips curled into a snarl, ""You don't get to call me a fool, not after you-""

""BOYS!""

Both men jumped as Lily flicked her wand, freezing the two of them in place. She looked thunderous, so much so, both men seemed to wilt in front of the force of her. 

""If you are going to fight,"" she spoke in mock sweetness, a sharp smile that spoke of eternal agony if they didn't listen. ""You will take it to a different room and ward it with silent charms, or I will kick you both out of the house to fight in the back yard like the dogs you are! This is Harry's first birthday party, and I won't let you two ruin it with your bickering!""

Her temper was rising, Emory could feel it, crackling around the kitchen, it tasted electric, and sharp, sharp enough to cut her finger if she barely grazed it. Both men still looked ready to go at each others necks, but they seemed to have the decency to take Lily's words to heart practically nipping at each other's heels with whisper hisses and sharp growls. 

Lily's shoulders slumped as she fell into the seat that Remus use to occupy, James sitting next to her with an arm around her shoulder. She didn't realize it at first, but Lily was crying, the tears rolling down her cheeks as they fell upon the table. Emory held her breath, glancing up to find that Peter looked just as tired, and upset by everything that was happening.

""I just wanted us to be a family- a happy family for one fucking day,"" she cried, her accent sounding strange, slurred, thickening into something else before she seemed to force it down. ""I baked a cake, I managed to message the others of the order, and they sent their own gifts, we put this all together yet still-""

""I don't think it's ruined,"" Peter whispered, looking down at her. ""I mean, Harry seems fine? A bit confused maybe, but he hasn't cried once, and isn't that something?""

Emory looked from Peter, to Lily, and James who, looked surprised. She didn't cry that much did she? Not enough to be a shock like this, should she feel offended?

""Oh,"" Lily's voice cracked her watery eyes turning to look at her. ""Oh- Peter you're right he hasn't cried even once today.""

""Yeah, maybe he passed the water works onto you, and James, you both seemed to be crying a lot today,"" Peter joked, the teasing sounding gentle to her ears. How could a man that seemed so content be a traitor? How good of an actor did he have to be, to be able to say this to her parents, to have the gall to hold her gently as if he gave a damn about any of them. 

The three sat in silence, Lily having done her best to clean up her face as James kissed her temple. Lily had rested her head against James shoulder as the three of them tried to let the emotions of today go through them. The cake, which she hadn't noticed at first was covered with white frosting and tons of rainbow sprinkles. She supposed it was more for the adults then for her, since she never had a good track record with food in this new life. She closed her eyes, listening as the three talked quietly about this and that. James mentioning how good of a Quidditch player she was going to be when she was older; while Peter talked about the McKinnon's and apparently the lone survivor Marlene an how when she first woke up from the magical induced coma she had been put under the week before she had cursed that she'd missed Harry's birthday at this rate before passing out again.

""You know, before this old Bathilda had talked about showing up for Harry's birthday and us having a quiet birthday tea. Of course we declined since all of you would be coming over today, but I feel a bit guilty. She's such a sweet woman, always asks after Harry's health and the like.""

The whole time that Lily was talking about a name she barely recognized, she kept turning the idea over and over in her head. Peter had set her on the highchair, as he had cut the cake and handed everyone a nice big slice, even she had gotten one though none seemed to think she would eat it.

""Mummy,"" Emory began slowly, her voice sounding slurred. Lily's head jerk up, staring at her with an open mouth while her dad's eyes seemed to pop from his head. She's sure if her, and James weren't already sitting down they would've fallen on their asses, blown away by the next words she spoke. ""Da, I love you,"" she finished feeling that given how stressful their day was that this was the least that she could do for Lily, for the both of them. Sure she wouldn't get to have the fun of saying her first word was fuck, but this mattered much more then her childish wants to mess with the adults around her.

""It looks like I was wrong,"" James whispered, sounding choked up. ""It looks like our little Harry had to prove us wrong. He didn't have his first word, he had to make it his first sentence!""

Lily laughed, the sound watery to her ears but she didn't care, both of them finally looked their age, joyful as they hugged each other.

Emory's stomach grumbled, making all the adults in the room laugh. With a smile of her own, she reached forward much to everyone's shock, and grabbed the cake before thrusting a bit of it into her mouth.

""Wait, that's dark chocolate! Peter stop him before-""

But it was too late, she didn't care if she got sick from this. Quickly she grabbed fistfuls of the delicious cake, gleefully stuffing it into her mouth, even though she had ate to much to the point she'd probably choke. Everyone had jerked up from their seats, sending the camera that Sirius had left behind falling to the floor, a click went off as a picture was taken which they would find later to be of their legs rushing forward much to the groups collective amusement it soon would become one of the favorites in the album."

James Potter observed, looking at the shimmering, pearly white potion in his friend's cauldron.

Sirius Black shook his head.  ""Couldn't be.  I can't smell anything.""  He leaned in closer to his potion and inhaled.  The odd thing was, he shouldn't have needed to.  His textbook said Amortentia was incredibly aromatic, not to mention how much his sense of smell had heightened since fifth-year.  There was a hint of...some sort of spice?  But at this point Sirius was pretty sure he was just imagining it.

He was interrupted from his thoughts when he felt James' hand still his.  ""Don't over stir, mate.  Dad says you've gotta figure out what you did wrong before you do anything else.""

James' dad, Fleamont Potter was a somewhat famous potioneer, known for inventing Sleakeazy's hair potion.  He was a great person, and Sirius had grown to see him as a second father (or perhaps a first father, to tell the truth) ever since he'd moved in with James when they were both sixteen.  He'd rather not think about it at the moment, but the short story was that his so-called ""home"" had simply gotten to be too much.

""Hey, Lily!"" James exclaimed, waving at where Lily Evans, the potions prodigy of their year, was working with their other friend, Remus Lupin.  She looked up, and James grinned at her.  ""Can you help us?""  Lily nodded, her face slightly red, and began walking over.

""I reckon she likes you.""  Sirius observed, having noticed her blush.

""Nah, she doesn't.""  James replied, slightly dejected.  ""We're friends now.  It's fine.  Better even.  I'm over her, really mate.""

Sirius hmm-ed in response, glancing at James cauldron.  He didn't have to speculate too much on what James may or may not have smelled, but really, he was too fed up with this potion to care much for James' love life just then.  He was flipping through his potions book, trying to find where he went wrong, when Lily approached them.

""What do you boys need help with?"" she asked, leaning against the front of their table.

""Sirius can't smell anything,"" James said nodding at Sirius and his cauldron.

Lily scrutinized the potion.  ""It seems to be the right shade...you added all your silver powder, yes?""  Sirius nodded, and gestured at his empty mortar.  ""Okaaay.""  Lily bit her lip, thinking.  ""Did you add two many rose petals?  They're very fragrant, too many, and all you'd be able to smell is rose.""

""But I can't smell rose,"" Sirius pointed out.  ""I can't smell anything.""

""You're right...it's awfully odd.""  She inhaled.  ""No, you definitely did it right.  It smells like..."" she trailed off, and Sirius saw her eyes flit to James for half a second, before returning to look at Sirius.  She cleared her throat, and continued.  ""It smells how it usually does for me.  James?""

""What?""  James asked, surprised at being addressed.

""Does it smell normal to you?"" she asked.  ""Sirius' potion?""

James inhaled.  ""Oh, yeah, definitely.  Smells like...y'know, the usual.""  He blushed, and tried to avoid staring at Lily.

Oh my Godric, do they have to do this now? Sirius thought.  He didn't say that, though. ""So, what's wrong, then?"" he asked instead.  ""Why can't I smell anything?""

Lily chewed on her lip, and looked around, thinking.  ""You know what it could be?  You could be too close to the ingredients.  They can smell fairly strong.  I mean...the potion should be stronger, but I suppose it's possible, theoretically, that one who disliked strong smells would have a less stronger smelling Amortentia, because, well obviously it's meant to smell like what attracts or comforts you, and it would be quite counterproductive of it to be overly fragrant when one--""

""Lily!"" Sirius interrupted.  ""Slow down there.  The ingredients might be too potent, you said?""

""Yes, I suppose.  I mean, it's all I can think of."" she replied.

""Brill.""  His dog senses must have picked up on the ingredients instead of the potion.  That had to be it...right?  ""So, what do I do?""

Lily thought about it for all of two seconds before grabbing his cauldron, and walking to Slughorn's desk.  Sirius turned to James, who just shrugged.  He reluctantly followed her to the front of the room.

""Professor, Sirius was having trouble smelling his potion.  I figure it might have to do with how strong the ingredients can smell, especially back in that corner.  Now, I know you don't want the potions leaving the classroom, and with good reason, of course,"" Lily was surprisingly good at this.  She was fairly convincing l, and of course it didn't hurt that she was Slughorn's favorite.  ""But really, I'd be happy to go with him, and keep an eye on things.""  At this point Lily adjusted her sweater ever-so-slightly that her head girl badge got the light.  Not a bad touch, if Sirius did say so.

""Why of course, of course!"" Slughorn declared, beaming at Lily.  ""Go on, I trust you, of course, Lily.""  Lily smiled back at him, before discreetly elbowing Sirius in the chest.

""Ow...um, thank you, sir."" he muttered.

Lily turned around to begin walking out of the room, and Sirius saw her rolling her eyes.  While Slughorn was shouting that ""of course, of course, anytime, young boy"" or something like that, Sirius whispered to Lily ""That was smooth.  You'd make a wonderful Marauder.""

Lily scoffed, ""It was hardly breaking the rules, Sirius.""

""Still,"" Sirius muttered, ""we can always use a teacher's pet.""  He nodded his head at Remus as they walked past his desk.  Lily raised her eyebrows.  ""Well, that and he's our friend.  But so are you, Evans.""

""Right,"" Lily said, holding the door open, and handing him his cauldron as he walked past.  He leaned in and inhaled.  He could definitely smell it, but it was decidedly still the smell of the potions room.  ""Well?"" Lily asked, stepping out of the doorway and into the corridor.

""It just smells like the classroom..."" he inhaled, and caught a strong whiff of the spices he thought he had noticed earlier, though they were more recognizable now, ""and...masala"" he finished.  ""Spices."" he added at Lily's confused expression.

""What kind of spices?"" Lily asked.

""All sorts, I guess.  Saffron, cardamom, turmeric.  They're very...fragrant.""  Sirius realized where he'd smelled these before.  ""They're the sort that Mu...Mrs. Potter uses.""  Then, Sirius suddenly realized something.  Of course, he thought, that's why I couldn't smell it in the classroom.  ""Thanks, Lily!  You're the best!""

Lily looked at him, confused.  ""I...okay?  What did you smell?""  

Sirius didn't really want to tell her.  Lily knew he lived with James, but he didn't want to get into it.  He just smirked at her.  ""What did you smell?""

Lily flushed bright red.  ""Well, I...it's complicated.  Sort of...private actually, I'd rather not..."" she stammered, ""you don't have to tell me, if yours is private, I just...""

""Relax, Evans, it's not a big deal.  Thanks again!""  Sirius said, walking past her back into the classroom, where Slughorn was walking around assigning grades to students' potions.  Lily followed him in, and they went to their desks.  He sat down at his table next to James, and put his cauldron in front of him.

""Well?"" James asked, ""Did it work?""

""Yeah, just fine,"" Sirius muttered, nervously tracing a circle on the table with his finger.  He found the whole situation rather embarrassing.  Sure, James would be cool about it, but...well, he just wasn't great at these sorts of conversations.  Feelings-conversations.  

""So?  What was it?  What did you smell?  Why wasn't it working here?"" James grinned at him, ""Don't tell me your Amortentia smells like potions ingredients!""  Sirius blushed, and kept his eyes focused on the table.  James noticed his sudden silence and asked, ""Does it?  Smell like potions ingredients?""  Sirius looked at him and nodded.  This was positively mortifying.  ""Oh, Pads.  Mate, I didn't mean to...I mean, that's okay.  I just...I never thought you liked the class much, is all.  It's fine, really, I don't care one way or another.""

Sirius shook his head.  ""It's not the class, it- it was more like...your dad's brewing room.  And...your mum's masala, I...it smelled like...your house.""  He didn't really know what else to say, so he kept his head down.

Their conversation paused as Slughorn came over to grade their potions, before vanishing them with his wand.  He assigned the homework (2 feet on the purpose of the ingredients in Amortentia) and dismissed the class.

""Really?"" James asked, as they packed up their stuff.  ""My house?""

Sirius nodded.  ""Yeah, I guess cause...y'know, you guys are like family to me, and I guess that...well, it's more of a home than Grimmauld was, and...I don't know Prongs, I'm not good at...this sorta thing.  You know that.""

James laughed.  ""It's okay, mate.""

They headed out of the classroom with Remus and Peter, before splitting off to go to muggle studies.

They were about halfway there when James brought it up again.  ""I'm glad you moved in with us."" he said, suddenly.  Sirius turned to look at his best friend.  ""I mean, it's been nice having you around, of course, but really...I'm just glad you got out of that house.""

""Thanks,"" Sirius muttered, looking down at his shoes.

He didn't like talking about Grimmauld, much.  He missed his brother, even if Regulus clearly didn't miss him.  At least he knew his brother was safe, Regulus had never made Mother angry the way Sirius did.

He looked back up at James.  ""Thanks for saying that.  And for...being my friend, and taking me in, and...not laughing at me, with the potion.""

""Padfoot,"" James said, smiling and shaking his head.  ""You're my best mate, you know I'd do anything for you.""  James stopped walking, and pulled Sirius into a hug.  They stood like that, for  a brief moment, before remembering they were, in fact, in the middle of the corridor.

""And I'd never laugh at you,"" James added, as they continued on their way.  Sirius raised his eyebrows.  ""Okay, sometimes,"" James admitted, ""but it's usually justified.""

""Git,"" Sirius muttered, reaching over to mess up James' hair.  James ducked out of the way, and stuck his tongue out.  ""Whatever, your hair doesn't need my help to look like a bird's nest,"" Sirius mocked.

""Hey!"""

Hyacinth Potter, Hadrian Potter, Harriet Potter; the list goes on and on and on until the close.

Except here. 

Here, just before Harika Potter sets down that Elder Wand, she hesitates. Her fingers trace the worn wood and it warms like sunshine on a bright Hogwarts morning. Home, it says. 


Wouldn't you like a home, Hari?


Hari may be a golden lion, true, but her heart is a hungry thing. A ambitious thing. A Slytherin thing. 

And like all Slytherin things, her heart knew how to recognize an offer when it saw one. 

Just one spell, Hari. Just one. 

Maybe she would have accepted, her hunger-bitten insides ached with the possibility, but-

Dumbledore peered over those glasses at her frozen form, and Hari knew well enough that she never could. 

The wand barely made a sound when it touched the desk, but it may as well been a particularly well-aimed bombarda with how Hari's body shook without that small weight in her hands. 

She took three steps towards the door, and her hands quivered with want. It was so close- 

But no. Harika Potter had more power than she knew what to do with already. She needed no more. 


But oh, silly girl, who said the only thing it gave was power?

Lily set a cloth bag full of reusable food containers on Remus' desk in the campus library. The werewolf had originally taken the job as a way of earning money while getting his degree. In less than a week of working there, that had changed. Remus loved working in the library, even when his shifts were unexpectedly extended, and he needed meals brought to him. The only hard limit he put on his hours was keeping the Sabbath. Not seeing Remus in the immediate vicinity of his desk, Lily settled in his chair.

She pulled out her laptop. No matter how adorable Tony was, she really regretted letting him code unattended while sleep deprived and high on coffee. Honestly, she could see why his first projects couldn't progress pass beyond the understanding of a young child. The code base was a brilliant mess. The weaving of the algorithms and variables was beautiful. She couldn't wait for Tony to officially move to Cambridge as planned so that she could meet Dummy and U finally.

She had a feeling that Tony's boys would fit right in with the Marauders.

""I haven't heard you sigh like that since Marlene broke up with you and James,"" Remus commented as he dropped a stack of books beside the bag of food. He immediately began shuffling through the bag containing his dinner. The smell of warm spices wafted up from the containers as he opened them. ""Oh, now I know something is up. Beef curry and Gobi Manchurian?"" His eyes were gold when he looked up at her. ""What are you up to, Lils?""

""I need you to keep Sirius occupied and out of the flat tomorrow afternoon,"" Lily announced. At his stern look, she pouted. ""You should be nice to me. I made beef curry for you, Remus! I cooked beef in our kitchen.""

""Yes,"" Remus agreed, ""and that is why I'm suspicious. You, a humble wife--"" Lily snorted. Remus gave a crooked smile that made her want to curl around him until he relaxed enough for it to be a full grin. ""--of a proper Hindu cooked beef in the same kitchen where you prepare his meals. You also cooked cauliflower, despite how much you hate the way it smells. So, what are you up to, Dr. Evans Potter?""

""James and I are having my lab partner over for lunch,"" she answered. Remus gestured with his fork for her to continue before taking a bit. She grinned triumphantly at the mistake. ""We're hoping that Tony will be dessert.""

Remus choked on his nasty cauliflower. Serves him right. He should have known better than to eat or drink anything when she or Sirius were talking. They always managed to say something shocking. He managed to swallow the bite.

""You're evil,"" Remus accused without any real venom. ""I don't even know why I put up with you.""

""Who else would listen to you bellyache about your time of the month when you've chased away James and Peter and Sirius has gone to resupply your chocolate stash?""

""I don't--""

""Oh, but you do,"" she interrupted. ""You really do bellyache. But it's okay because your entire body is attempting to turn itself inside out."" She saved her progress proofing Tony's addition to their code. Then she closed and packed away her laptop. ""I do need to get back to the flat. Sirius had been trying to convince James to let him try baking again.""

""Yes,"" Remus agreed hurriedly, ""get back to the flat. The last thing we need is another flight of gingerbread hippogriffs tracking over the bathroom for a week. Worse than the self-replicating rubber ducks.""

""I thought we agreed to not talk about the Ducks,"" Lily whined. She gave his cheek a kiss as she rose, leaving behind the faintest impression of her violet lipstick. ""Take care, love. Don't get lost in your books and forget to make it home before curfew. You know how prissy campus security can be, even if you are rocking the whole librarian look.""

""Yes, Mom,"" Remus replied, only a bit snarky. He knew as well as she did that campus security was already leery about their group because of the visible diversity they had between them. They really didn't need to give them any more excuses to harass any of them. ""I'll have you know that Sirius likes my librarian look.""

""That's because he has taste,"" Lily said. ""I would totally go for it, too, if it didn't feel so damn incestuous to James.""

""It is nice to know that you and James have some limits."" Remus stabbed a cube of beef from his curry. ""Goodness knows how often one of you are interrupting me and Sirius.""

""Please, like we haven't already seen Sirius naked,"" Lily quipped as she began to walk away. Remus sputtered behind her a few times before finally getting a reply together.

""That's not fair! All of Gryffindor has seen Sirius naked!""

She gave him a quick wink over her shoulder and just kept walking."

Upon shutting the door behind them, they collapsed, almost in unison, on the armchairs near the barren fireplace.""That was amazing!"" Hermione exclaimed, still laughing as she wiped some pigment from above her eyes, only succeeding in smudging it further.""I'm surprised you're not more concerned about us getting colour on the furniture, Hermione,"" Ron said.""Oh, give it a rest, Ronald, I'm tired,"" she replied, grinning.Harry smiled, leaning back in his own seat with a feeling of satisfaction warmly spreading through him. It had been his first time attending Holi festivities since uncovering more about his lineage.He could just imagine his parents excitedly looking on as he realized his racial background and cheering for him when he decided to immerse himself in it. To think there had been an entire Indian Wizarding community in London, waiting with open arms to greet him and introduce him to the culture he'd missed out on growing up - it was still unfathomable to Harry. It made sense that this was soon followed by his eventual decision to convert to Hinduism, and introducing his partners to the culture made sense after that.""The bonfire was beautiful, too,"" Ron added. His face was very amusingly covered in mainly yellow. ""What was it called, again, Harry?""Before Harry could reply, Hermione had already jumped in. ""Holika Dahan,"" she said, waving a red-and-green hand. ""Honestly, Ron, don't you remember anything -""""Look I just found out about all this stuff two days ago -""""And so did I, Ron, we learned about them at the same time -""""Have you ever thought, Hermione, that maybe not everyone has a brain that could double as a sponge -""""Well have you ever thought, Ron, that you come up with the stupidest excuses for your terrible memory -""""Ugh, Harry, back me up here, will you? You have a normal brain like mine -""""I'm the one appreciating Harry's religious festivals, Ron, so clearly he sides with me -""Harry grinned as he watched Hermione and Ron bicker back and forth. Just a few years ago, he'd been so jealous of their romantic relationship. It had been such a confusing time for him, as he couldn't figure out which one of his best friends he was jealous of. When they'd come forward to him and asked if he'd like to be a part of their relationship, it all clicked into place, and the rest was history.Now, he couldn't imagine living his life any other way. It'd been strange, at first, since he was so used to being the third wheel, but Hermione and Ron had done everything they could to make him feel included. They held hands with him under the table at dinner, shared giant mugs of butterbeer, and lay intertwined on sofas and floors. They'd broken the news to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and aside from a few awkward questions from Mr. Weasley, it had gone well. They'd told some close friends and were met with congratulations and acceptance. To be honest, Harry had never felt so loved in all his life.Also, the sex was fantastic. Whether they were pleasuring each other and keeping their mouths and tongues busy, or he and Ron were both buried in Hermione, kissing over her shoulder to the sound of her moans and cries, it was mind-blowing. It was something that had also taken some time for Harry to fully adjust to, but he wasn't complaining - and he suspected neither of his partners minded.Harry came back to the present and found that Hermione and Ron were still going at it."" - if you listened to anything I'd been saying, Ron, you wouldn't have concluded that -""""All I'm saying is, it's unreasonable to expect that I'd ever -""""Ron, you're being ridiculous! Don't you think so, Harry?"" Hermione looked over at him, and he frustrated frown dropped away into an expression of exasperation. ""Why are you smiling?""Harry shook his head, unable to get the grin off his face. ""It's nothing.""""You didn't have too much of that funny spiced milk drink, did you?"" Ron asked, scrunching his nose. A few creases appeared in the dried-up coloured water staining it. ""It really was quite potent -""""He only had one small cup of it, Ron,"" Hermione replied. ""And it's called Bhang Ki Thandai.""""Now, how was I supposed to remember that?"" Ron grumbled.""It's literally thandai with bhang in it,"" Hermione said sternly.""What the bloody hell do those words even mean?""""Thandai is a cold drink made with spices, almonds, and other things like fennel and watermelon seeds. And bhang is cannabis. Seriously, Ron, Harry told you all of this yesterday.""""It's just a lot of ingredients to remember!"" Ron snapped. He paused, then went red, and Harry vaguely wondered if he'd turn orange due to the yellow splashed over him. ""Wait, cannabis? As in, weed?""""Yes, Ron,"" Hermione said. ""Don't tell me you're going to be immature about this. It's a very common drink during festivals like these.""""My prior need for a sobering potion suddenly makes so much more sense now,"" Ron groaned. He turned to Harry. ""Why didn't you remind me of what was in it?"" He narrowed his eyes when he caught sight of Harry's still gleeful smile. ""Just why do you look so pleased with yourself?""""I was asking the same thing,"" Hermione said.The two suddenly turned on Harry, their argument already forgotten. He couldn't help the fact that his grin was impossible to get rid of, even if it was starting to hurt his blue-dyed cheeks.""You two are great,"" Harry said, smiling. ""Just fantastic."" The softening of Hermione's gaze and the pink colour rising to Ron's ears met his words. ""And I've just thought of a great way to have a private afterparty...""A few minutes later, in their bedroom, that private afterparty was in full swing, and as Hermione took him into his mouth while Ron filled her, Harry couldn't think of any place he would rather be."

She feels petty right afterward, but not petty enough to put them back. After all the crap he's put her through, he deserves some suffering in his life, and what better way to make that obvious to him than by bringing cabbages home? It is a plan for the ages, and boy, is she going to win this argument. 

She'd decided to go grocery shopping partly in order to cool down, and partly because they'd nearly run out of vegetables that afternoon, but by the time the cashier's finished ringing everything up, she's worked herself up into full-blown righteous indignation. She loves her husband, she really does, but he's so good at pushing all the wrong buttons sometimes. It had started out so small, so silly-- Janardhan had made Hari's bath too warm and he'd screamed for an hour and, of course, she'd had to fix it.

And that was the way things always were-- he would screw up and she would have to clean up his messes.  Sometimes I feel like I've married a child!, she'd shouted, and the conversation devolved from there. They'd spent an hour screaming insults and accusations at each other, until finally she'd stormed out of the house, too angry to think straight. She'd heard a faint ""I love you"" yelled at her, as she slammed the door shut, but she'd chosen to ignore it then, and was choosing to ignore it now. She knows just what to say to him now, and so she Apparates back to the house, bag full of cabbage heads in hand, ready to deliver the perfect comeback and end this once and for all, and-- the top floor is gone.

At first, it seems too absurd to be true, and she wonders if her husband's bad eyesight has become contagious.  How did he screw up feeding Hari this badly? , she thinks, a familiar exasperated expression settling onto her face as she wonders what she'll say to him this time, but then she really thinks about it for a second.

Oh God,  she thinks, the cold iron fist of fear grabbing her heart and squeezing it tight. The top floor is gone. 

And then she's racing through the gaping hole that used to be her front door and up splintered stairs, distantly noting an overturned chair here, a scorch mark there.

Within seconds, she's standing inside the nursery doorway. The first thing she sees are Janardhan's glasses, lying broken on the floor. The lenses are cracked, spiderwebs of lines weaving their way through the glass, and-- and---

Her husband, her Janardhan, is lying far too still beside them.

His whole body is strangely limp, his whole posture so  off,  and he's staring emptily up at the ceiling in a way that is so very  wrong  that, for a second, she thinks he's pulled the worst prank ever. ""How dare you!"" She wants to yell, and watch his features come alive again, a sheepish grin lighting up his face. But she knows better.

The familiar mischievous glint in his hazel eyes is gone, as if it's been sucked right out of him by a Dementor, and Lalitha's gaze travels from his still chest, up his motionless arm, and down the fingers reaching desperately through the bars of Hari's crib, hoping that the lack of noise from it doesn't mean what she thinks. Her heart climbs up into her throat as she desperately hopes that her son, her beautiful, darling, loud little boy, is just sleeping, too caught up in some soft, wild dream to wake at the sound of someone entering his room.

But she's watched him sleep so much, over the past fifteen months, memorized the soft flutter of his eyelashes against his chubby brown cheeks and the way his tiny chest rises and fall evenly with every breath and something is wrong because he's so still. Her baby, her Hari is defined by motion, by the way he climbs up and down the stairs carefully and runs wild through the kitchen. He's not moving. He's too still, and he's not breathing, and neither is Janardhan. They're not breathing. They're  not breathing .

Lalitha wants to scream but she can't, she can't even breathe. It feels like she's forgotten how, to match her husband and her son. She thinks of Janardhan in his last moments, reaching out to his son,  their son. She wonders if he was thinking about her, if he knew how much she loved him, how much she wished that had been the last thing she'd said to him. It was the last thing he'd said to her-- he'd said that he loved her, as the last thing, and what had she done? Her hands are shaking, and she can hardly feel her face, because it feels like there is some awful buzzing building beneath her skin.

In the midst of the panic, she notices one thing-- as always, Hari looks just like his father.

 She doesn't know which is worse-- that first realization, or the ones she has a hundred times every day, when she makes plans around the two people-shaped holes in her life. It would be so much better, she thinks, if she carried that around with her constantly, numbing her to the pain.

It's so sudden when it happens. She'll glance in a shop window and think about how Hari would love that spinning top, how that shirt would bring out Janardhan's eyes, and then when she remembers, it's always as bad as that first time.

When she thinks about them now, she doesn't let herself think Janardhan and Hari, because somehow, that is all the more painful. They were James and Harry to the Marauders, to the world, and when she mourns them as James and Harry it feels as though she is sharing this burden of grief, she doesn't have to carry it all alone. But Janardhan and Hari were solely hers, her boys, the loves of her life, and they can only be mourned by her-- and right now she is not strong enough to bear that weight.

It makes everything a little more endurable, for them to be James and Harry and her to be Lily. It's an act she can put on, just a part to play, and she doesn't have to think too hard about everything she lost.

People visit a little, in the beginning. Offering consolations and trite words of wisdom alike, things like  It'll get better  and  Everything will be alright  . What's even worse is the things they don't say, the spaces between their words when all she can hear is  Thank god it wasn't me.  People fear death, and though she is alive she is as steeped in death and sorrow as one can be.

There are really only two people she even wants to see, right now. That is not true-- there are four people, counting the two people she actually most wants to see, but can't. But the two who she can feel just as far away, these days. She cannot bring herself to take that first step, to see them, because more than the living, it would be the empty spaces that would stand out, the sentences left unfinished, the tenses that would start out present before changing to past.

There would be too much silence, Lily thinks, and shelves the issue. Besides, they were his friends first, anyway.

So when Severus Snape shows up at her doorstep, it is almost the last thing she is expecting. 

He is there when she opens the door to grab the morning paper, his hand poised to knock at the door, and when she registers his existence she almost closes the door in his face. She isn't quite sure, in the end, why she doesn't-- the lack of human interaction she's had recently, perhaps, combined with her rather unstable emotional state, along with numerous other reasons-- but, before she really has a handle on the situation, he's in her sitting room with one of her terrible cups of chai James always used to tease her about.

The silence between them is thick, and Lily doesn't have the energy to break it. There has been too much said between them, throughout the years, or maybe not enough. He's always been good at breaking things and she's always been the one to fix them, but for once she doesn't want to.

""How have you been?"" he asks finally, and she has to fight not to laugh at the absurdity of this question.  I've lost everyone in this world who I loved the most,  she wants to say.  I had to cremate my baby son. Can you imagine outliving your son, Severus? How do you think I am? But she is too drained, too tired to say any of what she actually feels.

So instead, she gives him a mirthless smile. ""Not very well.""

This seems to make him realize the foolishness of his question, and he breaks eye contact and looks down. ""Yes, o-of course,"" he stutters. ""I'm sorry about them."" 

And, all of a sudden, Lily is furious because Severus had  hated her husband, and he'd never even met Harry. How dare he say these meaningless words to her?"" 

""Don't pretend like you're actually sorry,"" she snaps, and her voice is whip-sharp. Sev- Snape flinches like he's been slapped across the face. ""Why are you here?"" she asks finally.

""I just... I wanted to see how you were doing,"" he says.

Lily scoffs. ""Nothing's changed since the last time we saw each other. I'm still a mudblood, and we all know how you feel about that, don't we?""

""I never thought of you like that."" Snape says, after a pause to think. ""Not even when we were kids. You were always... You were always just like me.""

""What is that supposed to mean?"" She asks coldly. Lily knows what he's saying, deep down, what he's about to say, but she doesn't want that to be it.

""Your father was... He was like Potter, but you were never... you were never like that."" Snape says carefully, as if he is afraid to offend. Little does he know, he is doing more damage like that than he would if he were honest in his intentions. ""You were like me, and not... Like Potter was. You know.  Foreign ."" He says, the distaste in his voice a little too obvious, a little too unguarded.

Lily can feel the blood rushing to her face. Layered under Snape's words, she hears the classmates who would ask her, ""so what are you,  really?"". She sees every confused look from passers-by she would get when she was out alone with her father.

She wants to scream at Snape, hex him maybe, but instead she musters up all the ice in her voice she can and looks him square in the eye. ""Get out.""

Snape opens his mouth as though to argue, but something in her face must tell him how close she is to snapping, because instead he nods stiffly and gets up. ""If you ever come to your senses, maybe we can talk again,"" he bites out, and Lily nearly does hex him for that.

But then he's gone, and all Lily is left with is the sharp edges of the words he'd spoken and the bone-tired weariness of someone who'd heard the same words thousands of times before.

Lily calms down soon after Snape leaves. She can still feel the anger thrumming deep inside her, but this is an old anger she has lived with all her life, and it is not in danger of bubbling out of her. And, now that she is calm, she realizes a few things. 

The first is that she can't continue like this. She can grieve-- she has to-- but this wallowing is not helping anyone, least of all her. She knows that she could continue like this forever, sinking into her sadness until she forgets to feel anything else. And  God it would be so much easier than anything else, to live among memories of ghosts. But Lily has never been about doing what was easy, after all. And she wasn't about to start now.

The second is that she can't keep thinking of them as James and Harry. That might have been the people they were for the world, but Janardhan and Hari were  who they were , and she can't take that away from them just because it pains her so to remember them in everything they were. She has known this all along, but it had taken Snape trying to erase her, erase Janardhan and Hari's Lalitha, so callously for her to change.

She starts to make little lists in her head, tiny things she can accomplish because thinking about the reality of a life without them is so insurmountable. Go three hours without crying. Don't stay in your pyjamas all day. Remember to water the tulasi plant. She doesn't think about how if Janardhan were here, he'd tease her for this obsession she'd always had with her plans and her lists.

""En anbe, en uyire."" He'd tease, as he wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, bending down to rest his head in the space between her neck and shoulder. His hair, sticking up in a thousand different directions like usual, would tickle her cheek, and she'd try not to laugh. She can almost feel his fingers tapping some half-remembered rhythmic beat against her hip, can almost feel his breath, warm against the side of her neck. It is hard to remember, sometimes, that these moments with him are just memories. ""Ellaathukkume plan poda vendaam."" (My love, my life, you don't need to plan everything.)

But Janardhan isn't here to tell her that, so she does, partially out of spite, and partially because she wants to see if he'll come back, if she plans enough. She knows it is unreasonable-- nothing but a wish, a want, some ridiculous dream that will never come to fruition, but she can't help but think that, if she succeeds, he might come back, might groan at her again in that melodramatic way of his and make her forget the need for planning entirely.

The first time she tries to go a few hours without breaking down, she thinks about the time her boys once made each other cry by starting a food fight right before lunch on rasam sadham day and ends up choking back tears in the windowless bathroom of a tiny coffee-shop in the first half hour. She can almost hear them calling for her, Hari's tearful yells of ""Amma"" interspersed with Janardhan's ""Lalitha!"", and she clamps her hands over her ears like that will change something. There is a part of her that enjoys hearing their voices again, though, a part that is much larger than she'd like to admit, a part of her that doesn't even want to succeed, because succeeding would mean letting go of them, of her boys.

It feels like a betrayal of her boys to even live on without them, let alone start to build a life of her own. There is a nasty little voice in her head that says,  Janardhan wouldn't try so hard to move on -- and the thing is, she knows it's true, that if their positions were reversed, he'd dwell on the loss of her, of Hari, to his last breath.

But she is not Janardhan, and she cannot function like that, living a shadow of a life, walking in the footsteps of ghosts. So she takes a deep breath, and works to make her worst hell into a world she still wants to live in.

Lalitha has had enough of visitors showing up at her doorstep for a lifetime, and this heavy sense of disgruntlement is what she feels that morning when she realizes that there's yet another one. But then she opens the door, and-- it's Remus. He looks tired, she distantly notes, and then laughs internally because they're  all  tired, all the way down to their bones. And then she's smiling so wide her cheeks hurt and maybe crying a little too, because it's  Remus, and finally, she doesn't feel so alone.

They talk for hours about too many things to count, all the while ignoring the ghosts between them. She asks about Sirius, and learns that he's a mess, more or less. But he has Remus, and so she knows he will be okay, and she can see that Remus knows this too.

They don't talk about Peter.

Lalitha has tried not to think about Peter at all, really. She knows, on some level, that he's still out there somewhere, this man she and Janardhan had loved as a brother. The man who was responsible for the death of her family. But if she allows herself to feel that too deeply, to hold Peter accountable right now, she knows that the fury will be too much for her to bear, and she's already a mess of emotions even on her best days. One day, she knows, she will want to search him out and find out  why he would do this to her. To his best friend. To the little baby boy who had adored him.

But, until that day comes, she is content to pretend that Peter Pettigrew never existed at all.

When Remus gets up to leave, Lalitha panics for a second because she has to say something about everything that's happened, she can't just leave it like this. But then he smiles and says ""It was really good to see you,"" and it's okay, because he  knows . Remus has always been good at knowing the words unsaid.

Lalitha smiles. ""It was... It was good to see you too,"" and it's the first time in a long time that she's said that and meant it.

There's a letter from Pavi-no, Petunia, Lalitha has to remind herself. She hasn't been Pavithra for a long time-- since they were kids, really. It says 'To Lily' on the envelope, and though Lalitha isn't surprised, it does sting a little. Petunia has always done her best to erase anything that might make her different, from having a sibling who could do magic to having a parent who wasn't white.

Lalitha remembers the friends she used to bring home, blonde and blue-eyed with whispered comments and wrinkled noses at the murukku their father would sometimes put out. Lalitha had always hated them and hoped that one day Petunia would realize, too, how they didn't know her, not really. They loved Petunia but they knew nothing of Pavithra, who was once so proud that her name meant pure, but disappeared somewhere along the way.

But that was the way Petunia had wanted it, and in the end, she'd married one of those friends. Vernon Dursley, someone who was so unlike them in every way possible. So unlike them, in fact, that Lalitha often privately thought that Vernon was inhuman-- he resembled a walrus more than he did any of the other white people she knew.

That had been one of the first things she'd found in common with Janardhan-- an entirely understandable hatred for Vernon Dursley. It had started at that infernal wedding, when Vernon had turned up his nose at Lalitha's ""choice in partner"", even though neither she or Janardhan had even given a thought to an actual relationship, at that point. Of course, she found out much later that he definitely had, but seventeen year old Lalitha was still securely in the dark. 

Once Petunia and Vernon had left them alone, Janardhan had pulled the most hilarious face, a surprisingly accurate imitation of Vernon's ever present scowl, and had grumbled about drills and ""those damn immigrants"" for a solid two minutes, to get a laugh out of her. It had certainly worked, and so well that she'd nearly inhaled a quarter of her glass of water, and he'd ended up patting her on the back awkwardly while she coughed loudly.

Lalitha is almost tempted to throw the letter out.

She doesn't know what it contains, but it doesn't matter-- she and Petunia weren't exactly on the best terms. It was probably either vitriol or empty condolences many years too late, which was somehow even worse. But then she reminds herself that after all, this is her sister. The rift between them had grown so great that sometimes Lalitha didn't even feel like they were living on the same planet, but there was a part of her that had always held out hope that one day they might be on the same page again.

So she opens the letter and finds a cordial, although concise, invitation to tea. Lalitha can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this is close to the bottom of the list of things she wants to do with her life. She doesn't want to face Petunia, with her quietly smug satisfaction at the way her life has turned out compared to Lalitha's. She can almost hear Petunia's voice.  Look where magic got you. Maybe you were special and I wasn't, but at least I still have Vernon and Dudley .

But Lalitha has isolated herself from everyone for so long, and she knows that this isn't sustainable, not for her. This will be good for her, she thinks.

So she finds herself at her sister's home at the appointed time. The whole neighbourhood couldn't be more  Petunia if it tried-- the houses are exact copies in precise little rows, lawns trimmed to perfection, not a thing out of place. She stares at the front door for a good minute, psyching herself up to ring the bell. When she does, she has to wait only a second before the door swings open and she finds herself face to face with the sister she hasn't seen for over three years.

Petunia looks much the same. Her blonde hair is pulled back into a severe bun, and she looks at Lalitha disdainfully. ""You're late,"" she pronounces, as if the world should revolve around her, and Lalitha tries her best not to turn around right then and there. She promised herself she would do this, and now that she's here, she might as well see it through.

 Hello to you too, Lalitha thinks, but puts on an apologetic expression. ""There was a lot of traffic."" It's a joke because of course she'd apparated, but maybe it will lighten the mood a little.

Petunia eyes her suspiciously. ""I thought you people didn't use cars,"" she says. 

Lalitha winces internally. She should've known it would've fallen flat-- Petunia had never been one for humor after all. ""Yeah, we don't, I just... never mind."" She hadn't missed the usage of  you people  either. Petunia had the unique talent of making something so innocuous sound like  you freaks .

There's a moment where Lalitha stands awkwardly on Petunia's doorstep, waiting to be invited in. The silence is broken by the patter of little feet and suddenly there is a tiny boy standing next to Petunia, peering up at Lalitha. He tugs on his mother's skirt. ""Mummy, who's that?""

And then, Lalitha's heart is in her mouth because this must be Dudley. This is Dudley, and he looks nothing like Hari, with his pale skin and blond hair and rosy cheeks but all she can see when she looks at him is her baby. Her Hari, with his quick smile and always curious green eyes and full, chubby cheeks. Hari, who had just learned to run reliably, and had been doing so at every opportunity.  He will never be this old, she thinks, and it's everything she can do to not break down crying right there. 

Petunia doesn't seem to notice the look on her face, or if she does, she has the decency not to say anything-- Lalitha is willing to bet it's probably the former, knowing her sister. ""This is your Aunt Lily,"" says Petunia to Dudley.

Lalitha forces a smile. ""Hello, Dudley,"" she says, leaning down to shake his hand. Dudley stares at her outstretched hand and then looks up at her, frowning seriously in the way that only four, almost five, year olds can. She imagines Hari, taller and face a little thinned out, looking at her the same way, and the sudden flash of pain, bright and terrifying, in her chest makes her wonder if her heart really is breaking.

""I don't like you,"" he announces haughtily, his resemblance to his mother heightened for a moment, before scampering off. Lalitha stares after him, startled, before looking up at Petunia, who has the faint traces of a smile. 

""He takes after his father,"" she says, and her smile is almost smug. Lalitha thinks about how the first thing people would ever say when they saw Hari was  he looks so much like his father! And Hari had-- he had Janardhan's lazy, easy smile, and their faces were nearly identical, save for the fact that Hari had Lalitha's eyes. And then, all of a sudden, he was dead, and no one really said much of anything about him anymore.

""Well, I suppose you should come on inside,"" says Petunia, as though it is the last thing in the world she wants. Lalitha knows it probably is. She is suddenly very, very tired. This isn't the delighted reconnection with her sister she'd maybe hoped for-- Petunia clearly wants something from her, and she still doesn't know what.

She follows her sister into her home, distantly taking in the obsessively neat decor. There's a wall filled with photographs of Dudley, Vernon and Petunia, in various poses-- professional portraits, casual photos at the beach, birthday parties for Dudley.

Lalitha, Janardhan and Hari had never really been able to take many pictures of all three of them-- after all, they had been in hiding for all of Hari's life. 

There is a photo from the day Hari was born, of him lying fast asleep in Lalitha's arms as she rocked him. Janardhan was standing off to the side, looking at them both like he might actually die if he looked away. Anyone could look at it and feel how happy they are, how relieved and hopeful they are, and sometimes, when being in hiding had gotten too tough, Lalitha had dug it out just to remind herself that she felt that way, once. 

And then, there's a photo of the three of them from Hari's first birthday party. In it, Hari is laughing as Janardhan tosses him up in the air, arms spread out as if he is trying to fly. She is the one off to the side, this time, looking on with the brightest smile she had ever seen on her face. Lalitha's heart aches, thinking about it, because, just three months later, two of the people in it were dead. 

Lalitha no longer looks at those photos, because it is too painful. And she doesn't need to anyway-- she has memorized everything about them, from the curve of Hari's grin to the sound of Janardhan's laughter. It is easy to memorize something when you are constantly seeing it play out in your head.

They reach the sitting room before she can sink too deeply into her thoughts, and a voice calls out as they enter, ""Oh, Petunia, this must be Lily!"" The voice belongs to a well dressed man, his brown hair held flat against his head with so much gel that it resembles a helmet, who obviously has more money than he knows what to do with, and was, judging by the way he was positioned in his chair, conversing excitedly with Vernon Dursley just seconds earlier. Already, not Lalitha's favorite type of person. ""You know, she's even prettier than you said she was."" 

Lalitha blinks at him. ""'She' is also right here,"" she says. It's an effort to keep her voice pleasant.

""Don't be rude, Lily,"" Petunia scolds. She turns to the man. ""Excuse my sister, Nigel. She hasn't been well recently.""

As annoyed as Lalitha is, she cannot help but want to laugh. 'Hasn't been well'? She'd witnessed the aftermath of her family's murder.  Good old Petunia, always stating the obvious .

""I'm sorry."" Nigel replies glibly. ""Illness is always tough. I'm glad you're in good health now.""

""Illness?"" Lalitha repeats. ""I wasn't--""

""Lily, why don't you go freshen up before tea?"" Petunia cuts in. Lalitha turns to argue, but stops at Petunia's warning look. ""The washroom is down the hall to the left,"" Petunia continues, and Lalitha shoves her anger to the side and tries not to storm off.

""Quite a pleasant girl."" She hears Nigel say, down the hallway. ""I must say, Vernon, she's not that bad. I'm glad you and Petunia set this up."" They set this up. The thought makes her sick. This is what Petunia wanted. She should've known-- Petunia never did anything without an ulterior motive. Petunia, the schemer, always in possession of a greater plan. Suddenly, Lalitha is thankful for the fact that she used to call her sister Paavi as a child. Sinner was definitely much more of a fitting name for her.

All throughout the horrendously awkward tea that follows, Lalitha does her best to deflect any attempt at conversation from Nigel. Nigel doesn't seem to realize that he's ignored, and pontificates on all the subjects Vernon brings up, as if trying to impress her. Lalitha is markedly unimpressed, and, by the end of the visit, she feels like someone's literally grating at her nerves.

Nigel, who is also on his way out, is horrendously eager to arrange another meeting. ""Will I be seeing you again?"" He asks, far too enthusiastic given the fact that she's been trying to project disinterest as much as possible.

Lalitha looks him straight in the eye. ""I'm sure my husband wouldn't like that,"" she says coldly.

""Y--Your husband?"" Nigel stammers, turning bright red. Good, Lalitha thinks. It feels oddly like it had when she was picking out cabbages, and she files away the thought for later. ""I-- I wasn't aware, I'm sorry. Petunia hadn't mentioned that you were... spoken for.""

Petunia, on her part, looks as though she has swallowed an entire lemon. ""That's because he's dead,"" she snaps.

""Yes, that's... that's..."" Nigel looks rather embarrassed, and then all but runs for the door. ""Vernon, I'll see you at work tomorrow. Thank you for having me."" He says, before shutting the front door behind him, and Lalitha can see him striding down the driveway toward a fancy looking car, looking like he's been punched in the stomach.

Petunia rounds on Lalitha as soon as the door closes. ""I can't believe you were so rude!"" she shouts, and then all of the tension and fury that's been simmering under the surface boils over.

""Rude?"" Lalitha repeats. ""Rude? Petunia, my husband and son are dead and my own sister is pretending they never existed! And I'm the rude one for telling him I'm married?""

""Because you're not !"" Petunia hisses. ""You're not married, because he's dead, and you owe it to yourself to move past him. You could do better, and to wreck your life over him...""

""I'm not wrecking my life!"" says Lalitha in disbelief. ""I lost my family, Petunia! I'm still grieving! And if you loved me at all, if you were a good sister, you'd understand that!""

""Family,"" sniffs Petunia derisively. ""You knew him for what, four years? He's not  family.  Don't be so dramatic.""

""He was more family to me then you ever will be,"" says Lalitha, and, with that, Apparates out.

She's had enough of the Dursleys for a lifetime.

Lalitha and Remus go out and get coffee or tea together at least once weekly now, because Lalitha's chai is honestly the worst thing on this planet. She wasn't just saying that for fun. One time, she'd actually gotten Janardhan sick, and in between rounds of vomiting, he'd sworn that he was never letting her in the kitchen again. To this day, she didn't know what she'd messed up that time, but thankfully, it hadn't happened a second time. Or, she thinks, perhaps she just hadn't had enough time to repeat the mistake.

This is how their meetings usually go-- they sit at a coffeeshop and make up horrible backstories for people that walk by. On his good days, Sirius even joins them, but Sirius' terrible backstories are always horrible, and not in the good way.

""That man, with the polka dotted tie?"" Sirius says, stroking his chin dramatically. He is trying to grow a beard, this week. Lalitha wants to tell him that it looks stupid, but she's afraid of what he'll do if she does. Janardhan had had a much better beard, she thinks wistfully. ""That's his only set of clothes."" Sirius pauses for impact, looking around. Neither Remus nor Lalitha look suitably impressed, according to him, because he continues anyway. ""His entire family died in a fire, and he wanders the streets in the only set of clothes he has left, searching for justice.""

""That doesn't make any sense,"" says Remus. ""Why doesn't he just get new clothes? Or did his bank burn down too?""

""It's called suspension of disbelief, Remus,"" says Sirius with narrowed eyes. 

""More like suspension of all logic,"" mutters Remus.

""I think the real question here is what on earth possessed him to buy that tie,"" cuts in Lalitha. ""It's hideous.""

""It's tasteful."" Sirius says, pouting. ""I like it.""

""You would,"" says Remus with a roll of his eyes.

Hearing Remus and Sirius banter is equal parts amusing and painful. Painful, because Lalitha can hear the empty spaces where Janardhan might have interjected a sarcastic comment or a terrible joke.

It's strange, sometimes, how they're only barely twenty-six but have lived lifetimes more than most people ever will. No one ever talks about the aftermath of a war, when all people are left with are the pieces to pick up. Too many of them have been left behind by family and friends alike, and she knows that she is lucky in that not all of them have been able to function in the way she has.

She's come a long way from the person who broke down in a coffee shop thinking about her boys having a rasam sadham fight. Her grief is more of a dull ache now, that flares occasionally when she sees flashes of Hari in children on the street or notices particularly involved dads at the park, and thinks of how Janardhan would've been right there with the best of them, if he'd had a chance. She thinks it will always be like that. She can't imagine ever not seeing her boys in everything, and she imagines life would be quite lonely, without the little winks and nods from them sprinkled through, like little surprises for her to find. They are playing a scavenger hunt, almost, and she is finding their clues as much as she can, even the ones that break her heart a little.

They're all a little broken, with jagged edges and missing pieces. And maybe Lalitha will never be whole again. But maybe she doesn't have to be. Maybe getting up every morning and daring herself to face the world is enough.

Lalitha tunes in again to Remus and Sirius bickering about the stylishness of polka dotted clothing and her shoulders relax as she smiles. This sounds like a good place to start.

No letter arrives in June of 1991, because there is no almost eleven year old in Lalitha Iyer's house. 

Lalitha sits in a park and basks in the sun's slanting rays as the sound of children's laughter surrounds her. The paai she sits on is just big enough for two, and she can almost see Janardhan sprawled out beside her on the grass mat, sticking his fingers through the gaps in the weaving and laughing as he tells Hari whatever terrible pun he's just come up with. She doesn't have to think too hard to imagine Hari-- she knows that he would have been an exact copy of Janardhan at eleven, when she first saw him, all gangly limbs and uncontained energy.

No letter arrives in June of 1991. 

A concerned mother rushes to attend to a toddler who has scraped her knee. Lalitha has to fight not to laugh because Janardhan had always been good at injuring himself, and she can see Hari right now, tripping over his own feet and thin air alike, just like he would have tripped through life. She knows he would've always rushed in headfirst to every situation, never thinking about consequences, but it would've been alright, because she and Janardhan would have been there to pick up the pieces for him.

It is no longer a burden to miss them, she realizes. There's a kind of comfort in her grief, now. It's like an old blanket, familiar and warm, and she can wrap herself in her grief, her memories of what she has lost.

He always has hope, always fights hard, always gives everything he's got, and then falls just steps short of the finish line -- a heart attack, a poisoning, a disembowelment by a faceless enemy. Always too close, but no cigar. Always just on the edge of fulfilling his potential. Always an almost.

James Potter is rude and cruel and arrogant, and his friends (save for Remus) are much the same. They roll around on the floor of the Entrance Hall like puppies, run screaming down hallways, push each other down bannisters, and act like Hogwarts is their personal playground instead of a school they could very well be expelled from. They don't understand what it takes for people with less means (for people like Lily) to come to places like this, to get an opportunity to learn like this -- they live in a world where they can blissfully ignore the storm brewing outside the castle in a way Lily never will be able to.

But then, they do what she thought they never would: they grow up. Sirius Black learns to apologize. Peter Pettigrew learns to use his voice. Remus Lupin fights back against a world that's had him pinned against a wall with a hand around his neck.

And James Potter loses his razor sharp edges and melts into something truly beautiful. James Potter, somehow, against all odds, becomes kind. He becomes friendly. He replaces the bricks and mortar he'd torn from Lily's boundary walls and steps back, wiping his hands off on his trousers, and runs in the opposite direction.

So when he smiles at her for the first time (really smiles, not the fake smirk he pastes on while he directs Hogwarts' student body like a ringmaster at a circus), something within her aches, something dark and melancholy, and she thinks that the war snapping at their heels like an angry beast might take him to teach them all a lesson. They are all taking their roles now, stepping into archetypes crafted long before they were born, and James has unknowingly signed away his own life.

James Potter shines like the sun, too bright to look at straight on, and Lily Evans, like the stories have always foretold, falls in love.

Boys who look like James never get to be the hero.

He looks at himself in the mirror, skin the color of old pottery, eyes like honey, and thinks: heroism is not for me. 

Heroism is for boys like Sirius, with faces pale as the moon and gray eyes that carry knife strikes of disdain within them like a secret. Heroism is for boys like Peter, who get hailed as unexpected legends, as the hero no one saw coming, as a subversion of everyone's expectations. Heroism is for boys like Remus, boys who are carrying the weight of infinite sorrows but still redeem themselves, flying up to the sun like an Icarus with wings stuck with something stronger than wax, the glue that only years of suffering can make. 

Heroism is not for James, a boy with a name stolen from a language that doesn't belong to him, acting like he has a place here, like this could be his home in the same way it is Sirius', Remus', and Peter's. Heroism is not for a boy whose family name sparks hatred in people's hearts for something so simple as insisting Muggles can be, must be, just as human as wizards. Heroism is not for a boy who has grown up on the edges of a world that embraced Sirius, embraced Peter, but requires him to play like he's one of them, to spit at and kick Remus like he doesn't belong.

James would do well to steer far clear of the war. To go abroad with his parents, to go home, and shut his eyes and ears to injustice. To wait out the deaths and the suffering and come back when it was settled (or not come back at all). But because James is James, he signs up for the Order of the Phoenix the morning they all leave school. His parents didn't raise him to do the easy thing -- they raised him to do the right thing.

But there is still a tiny part of James that wants to be a hero, that wants to steal back the plot from the boys the world calls more suited to it, and say this is mine. This is mine and I will carry it with honor. This belongs to me.

When boys like James play the hero, they nearly always die. He conveniently ignores that.

Sirius Black has known exactly who he is from the moment he tumbled forth into the world, into the Healer's hands, into the cage of the Black family's reputation. Sirius Black has never doubted himself for a moment, has never even entertained the idea that he might like to change, that change might be good for him, that it might be good for those around him. Sirius smiles like a shark, rows of teeth ready to bite, and licks his bloody, cracked lips at the thought of an opportunity to be seen, to be known, to be loved.

Sirius Black knows he will be a martyr -- one side or the other will grow tired of his antics, his recklessness, his unpredictability, and they will kill him. He wonders how it will happen. A knife to the chest? Too mundane. Too boring. A poisoned drink would be interesting, at least, and he inspects every glass he takes at Order meetings with great caution. He thinks of all the great paintings, all the great plays, every book he read, and wonders in what form Death will come for him. Will it be an Avada Kedavra, clean and simple? Or something bloodier, something that will spawn poetry? Will it be someone he knows? Will it be someone he's hurt? Will it be entirely random, an act of chance, a miscalculation by the universe?

It is all a mystery, but Sirius embraces life as if martyrdom is guaranteed, as if it is an essential law of the universe that he will not live to see the end of the war. Boys from bad homes who grow up snatching pieces of happiness from the world to hoard like dragons are always punished. There are never happy endings for children who didn't have a happy beginning.

Peter has never seen himself as a potential hero, has spent too much time playing every single side of a scenario to call any one cause his own. 

He sees James and Sirius, commitment and conviction personified and bound together by brotherhood, and he wishes he were built for that, wishes he too could be a monument to a future that was promised to them but now has to be fought for, tooth and nail. He wishes he had Remus' fortitude, Sirius' ability to breeze through anything at all with his heart safely guarded beyond several locked doors, James' easy confidence and self-worth. He called them friends once. Would they call him a friend now?

He has never felt as comfortable as he does under Voldemort's wing, and that strikes him as a betrayal, the first in a string of many, as he sits in the front room of the cottage in Godric's Hollow, sipping on a hot chocolate James had made him. Sirius and Remus newly done wrestling with Harry, lie on the carpet, exhausted but laughing so hard their chests heave like their bodies are playing tug of war with the floor, and Peter wishes he could feel at ease here again. He wishes he could feel like one of them again, like one of four boys rowing in rhythm to bring the boat of their lives to shore.

Peter knows where he stands, in the story of their lives, the betrayer, the one who said goodbye first, the one who shattered their friendship beyond repair. He understands that, someday, people will call him evil in whispered voices. He just hopes it will be behind his back, where he can ignore it. He hopes that he will have the power to silence them with his deeds, his smarts, his actions, when people talk. 

He hopes that his friends will be alive to see it, but he knows better.

Peter may not be a hero, but he sure as hell doesn't think of himself as a villain. Don't most people fall somewhere in the middle anyway?

Remus is the last one left, the last man standing, the last Marauder.

It's cruel.

He never thought he, of all people, would be the only one left to see Harry pass over that thin, arbitrary line of a seventeenth birthday into manhood. He never thought it would be him, the sickly werewolf, the least favored friend (though he knows that's not true now, now that Peter sealed his own fate years ago), the one least suited to giving Harry the quiet, calm life he deserves. Instead, he watches happiness dance in Harry's eyes like it had in Lily's long ago, watches him smile James' same boyish, self-conscious smile. He watches Harry struggle to tie his shoes, watches Harry tell the worst jokes he's ever heard, and lets the river of time run forward toward its inevitable conclusion.

There are no old werewolves.

It is not a matter of werewolves passing into old age unseen, quietly disappearing into the embrace of society. They are all dead, gone somewhere beyond Remus' vision, and someday, he will join them. Maybe, if he is lucky, he will end up where James, Lily, and Sirius must be, a happy place, a good place, somewhere bright and beautiful. Maybe, if he is lucky, he will be allowed to spend the rest of the universe's time with them.

But he's never been lucky.

If he were lucky, would he have been bitten at all? If he were lucky, would he have lived to see his friends die, one by one, like crows leaving their perches on a power line? If he were lucky, if anything in the universe loved him, would he have watched his son (his son, his son, the words have a certain magic to them no matter where the emphasis falls) be born just weeks before heading off to war?

Remus is not a hero. Remus is a sidekick. But the sidekicks never have good chances, and the charity cases fare even worse.

Too bad Remus is both.

James has grown up with the knowledge that the human body is nothing more than a glorified suitcase for an eternal soul. Death is nothing more than forgetting it at the train station and climbing on without your things, realizing only when the train has left the station that your bag is still sitting by the bench you were waiting on, forgotten in your hurry. Even then, he is surprised when he dies, surprised by the instant shock of it. The strange sensation of being without a body, without limits. 

He sees the front room of the cottage, in Godric's Hollow, and behind him is the foot of the stairs where he'd-- where he'd-- oh well, there was no sense in avoiding the word died now that he was already dead, was there? He'd died there, a hand on the railing, and woken up on the floor like he'd gone on a drunken bender instead of running right at one of the most powerful wizards of the day without a wand. Even now, he didn't have a wand. 

He laughs, at his empty hands and empty pockets, at the horror of a life he's consigned his wife and son to, at what a horrible husband and father he's been, if he's signed over their lives. He could have fought longer, could have picked a better Secret Keeper, could have been so much more for his wife, for his son. He could have believed it could be about him, when Dumbledore said there was a prophecy, could have believed that Voldemort would choose his son. But no one ever chose boys that looked like James as the hero, no one had ever deemed him important enough to mark as the herald of their death, and James stupidly assumed that his son would be the same. 

Harry is a pretty boy with James' copper skin and Lily's green eyes, who sings along to songs of the radio with off tune screeches, and recently learned how to jump, much to everyone's consternation. Harry is hardly a boy yet, can't dress himself or get out of his crib alone or sleep through the night, and now he will learn those things without James, without his father, at his side. Harry will learn what the world is like, for boys like them, without a father to guide his path, to hold him when things are unfair and teach him to be proud of his work, of himself, of what he can do, in the few sparkling instances that they are not.

James crumples into a ball at the foot of the stairs and weeps, not for himself but for the son he's left behind, a son with no history and a deadly inheritance in the color of his skin, a prophecy hanging over his head that will, without a doubt, kill him some day. The hero never survives all the way, even if his body lives on -- something must always be sacrificed. Death's thirst always get sated, one way or another, and James can see it circling over his son, even if this isn't the cottage, isn't the same stairway, isn't the same world. Even if this is a sick parody of the place he'd lived and loved.

His son will be sacrificed to save other children.

Will he ever be able to repay whatever part of Harry remains? Will he ever be able to apologize for what he's done? Will Harry ever forgive him?

He should have known better. Nothing ever ends well for boys who look like him, in stories. From the beginning to the end, he should have known better.

Lily awakens on the nursery floor and hears the soft sound of crying from downstairs and thinks, for a second, that it is Harry. That it is Harry, who has somehow run fast enough past Voldemort to avoid death despite being all too fond of sliding slowly down the stairs on his stomach, one step at a time. She loses herself in that certainty for a second, that her son has survived, before reminding herself who is at the foot of the stairs. Who was at the foot of the stairs. Who has to be, if this is their home.

She feels like she is abandoning her son, with each step she takes toward the doorway of the nursery, her heart thumping painfully in her chest when she slips past it into something new, something unknown. Each step down the hall prompts a stabbing, ripping pain somewhere deep inside her. She can't turn around. There's no reason to turn around. 

There's nothing in this nursery.

She places a foot on the stairs and James looks up instantly, eyes bleary, having sensed her presence finally, and she runs toward him, never doubting him for a second, launching herself into his arms like she often did after a long Order mission, sobbing into his shirt. And James, as he's always done, comforts her. He wraps himself around her like a blanket, like armor, like a wall against the world, and lets her cry, lets her scream, lets her do anything she needs to fight her way back to whatever will be their new normal. His tears drip into her hair, his nose digging uncomfortably into the top of her head, and they grieve into each other, hands clutching at each other with a desperation they've never felt before.

""I love you."" Her voice has been wrung out like a wet dish towel, hoarse and creaky, but he smiles like he has been given a gift, her words lighting him up from the inside. James is a candle, a firework, a lightbulb -- something electric and fiery coursing through him in eternity -- but he's muted now in death, like there is some deep, dark sadness within him now that cannot ever fully be chased away. 

James has been switched off, forever. 

He doesn't say anything immediately afterward, brushes her hair out of her face with careful, shaking hands and kisses her like she is something precious, made of glass or porcelain, infinitely breakable.

""I'm so sorry."" He says and she crumbles again, safe within the circle of his arms. She'd often joked, when they were children who didn't know better, that she could never live without him. And now, she wishes she hadn't been so certain that a life without him wasn't worth living, that he hadn't agreed with her, so one of them could have survived to love their son. She wishes they hadn't loved each other so much, after saying those three words, and finds it hilarious that James picked three different ones for what was likely the same reason. ""I'm so sorry. I never meant for us to be here.""

""I know, baby, I know."" Lily fists her hands in his shirt. ""You didn't know. Neither of us did."" 

She wonders how long it had felt for him, being without her, remembers intimately the seconds between hearing the thudding noise his body had made against the floor and Voldemort appearing in the doorway of the nursery. She remembers each and every one of Voldemort's footsteps, his taunting words floating up ahead of him, the reminder that her husband had died for them, James' last heroic blaze of bravery doing nothing to protect him from mortality. 

It had felt like hours, for her. Days and days of torture. And here he was, as always, packing himself away for her, ready to welcome her with open arms whenever she was ready. She remembers that first real smile, the way he'd left space for her in every moment after, and reaches to grab his shirt collar and pull him down into another kiss, a hungry one, in the hopes that it would tell him everything she found herself incapable of saying.

I love you.

I am so happy you are not alone here anymore.

I wish we were both still with him but this is better than nothing.

James seems to understand, when she pulls away, something in his eyes hazy and unfocused, because he smiles, a ghost of the smile Lily remembers, but just enough to convince her. He pulls her close, arms wrapped tight around her, her head resting against his chest, and says sorry again, then a third time, then a fourth, each one blending into the next like scarves pulled out of a magician's mouth, and she gently punches him in the jaw.

""Ow, fuck."" He says, words slurred and uneven. ""I bit my fucking tongue.""

""Stop saying sorry, then."" She challenges, words still heavy with recently shed tears. ""Stop saying sorry and help me make this doable, then.""

""Yeah."" James says softly. ""Yeah."" And then he smiles, and then it feels real.

Sirius falls through a curtain and into the kitchen at Godric's Hollow, where James and Lily are making badly constructed robot horses joust with butterknives. They don't notice him for a second until Lily's knife falls off her horse and Sirius dives to catch it, bumping his chin on the tiles. 

""I hate everything."" He complains, and has only a second before James decides Sirius needs to get to know the floor face to face and jumps onto his back, screaming incoherently while nuzzling the back of his head. 

""It's good to see you again."" Lily says, kicking James off his back. Sirius scrambles to his feet, thankful to be freed, but has only a second before they both tackle him from either side, Lily barely avoiding knocking her head on the countertop as they all go down in a pile again. 

""Can't we do this somewhere more comfortable?"" Sirius whines, but feels at peace for the first time in years, the first time since October 31st, 1981. ""Why do you two always have to be so violent?""

""You're talking about violence? You? Sirius Black?"" James says, incredulous. ""Don't corrupt me, my wife has a hard enough time as it is.""

""God, I've been here some ten seconds and it's already 'my wife' this, 'my wife' that. I'll go find another place. Somewhere with single men."" Sirius groans, but loops an arm around James' neck, trapping his throat between elbow and bicep like a vice before rubbing his knuckles into James' head. That would teach him. ""I don't need losers cramping my style.""

""But we're winners."" Lily says sweetly. ""We won the Board Game Triathlon of July 1980.""

""You were in labor! We let you cheat until you absolutely couldn't wait anymore!"" Sirius exclaims. ""I'm still surprised you didn't have Harry right there on the couch, with how long you were willing to wait just to win Trivial Pursuit.""

Suddenly, he thinks of Harry and Remus, still in the Department of Mysteries, probably at risk of death themselves. Would James and Lily be so happy to see him if they'd known that Sirius had left Harry and Remus to die? If Harry and Remus followed him here, one after another, like little ducks in a line, would James and Lily still be so happy to see him?

""Harry."" James says, hazel eyes searching Sirius' face. ""Have you seen him? They gave him to you, right? He never-- he never showed up here, so..."" He looks to Lily, hope clear in his eyes, and she looks to Sirius, putting him on the spot. ""You look... older."" He frowns. ""How much older? How old is he now?""

""Do you not know?"" Sirius asks, a bolt of terror shooting through him. ""James, how old are you?""

""Twenty-one. Same as Lily."" James says. ""How much... how much time has passed?"" He looks to Lily, fear clear in his eyes. ""There are no... no clocks, no anything outside the house. It's like we're in a little pocket of the universe by ourselves.""

""He's about to turn sixteen. It's mid June, now. School's about to let out."" Sirius says softly, and James and Lily both recoil in horror. ""Nearly as old as his parents, now."" He can't resist making the joke, but they both wince, and it feels awful. ""He's getting his OWLs back this summer. He expects he'll do well."" 

He doesn't know what else to say, the secret of Harry's childhood with Petunia and Vernon feeling like too much for one conversation. Harry's hard won trust, the way he scouted out rooms on an endless loop of anxiety, the way he held his breath when any adult looked right at him, none of that was what James and Lily needed to hear.

""He looks just like you, James."" Sirius says instead. ""Like a fucking giraffe with glasses.""

James bursts into laughter.

""We taught him to shave last summer, Remus and I, and he nearly cut his own face off with a safety razor."" Sirius begins to laugh himself. ""He's got your temper, Lily. The world bites and he bites back. It's beautiful to watch. He's found-- he's found the Map! The Weasley twins, Fred and George, they've given it to him and Harry's used it to find empty classrooms to sit in. God, Evans, he's so much like you that it hurts sometimes.""

Lily, still shocked, reaches around Sirius to grab James' arm.

""Nearly sixteen."" James says softly. ""It feels like he was a baby just yesterday. For us, he was a baby just yesterday."" He stands up slowly. ""It's a lot to take in at once."" His eyes cut over to Lily, who's pulled herself up to her feet using the countertop, helping Sirius up after. ""Nearly sixteen. I can hardly believe it. We've been dead almost...""

""Fifteen years this October."" Sirius says, like an apology. ""He asked about you nearly every day. Wanted to know everything we could tell him. Didn't have much that was kid appropriate, but--""

""Oh, come on, what did we do that wasn't kid appropriate--"" Lily interrupts.

""We made the kid in question, I guess--"" James shrugs.

""Oh, shut up, both of you. He's a great kid and he'd be better with you there, but he's pretty damn perfect."" Sirius says. ""He's a wonderful kid and it's all you two. It's all what the two of you gave him. The rest of us just... helped him along.""

""Fifteen years."" Lily smiles. ""You've got a lot to tell us."" She reaches out for Sirius' hand. ""No time like the present, right?""

""No clocks either."" Sirius quips. ""If James can be believed.""

""Oh, shut it."" James complains, and there it is, the easy rhythm Sirius had missed for half of his life, wrapped up in a bow for him again.

Death isn't half bad.

Peter ends up somewhere cold and dark and lonely.

He deserves it.

Remus stumbles up to the door of a familiar cottage, knocks on the door, afraid of what he'll find. He knocks again, when there's no response, then the door swings open to reveal Harry, sleepy eyed and without his glasses and-- no, that's not Harry. That's James. It hits him like a punch in the stomach, that this is James, James who he has been hungry for, begging for, praying for for almost seventeen years, and the moment Remus has been given his wishes, he doesn't see them for what they are.

James catches him without a thought, the two of them forever caught up in a game of cat and mouse fueled by order and chaos and all those eternal things. They were supposed to be eternal. They were supposed to live forever, two dumb teenagers uniquely suited to understand what it meant to not really feel at home anywhere, clawing their way up into security and joy with their last dregs of strength. But James had died and now Remus is dead, both of them leaving young sons behind, and that is the first thing Remus says to his best friend.

""My son's name is Edward. Teddy. I wanted to call him Teddy.""

""I'm an uncle."" James says, awe and wonder turning his words into fireworks. ""You're a dad. Remus, that's brilliant."" He looks over his shoulder into the house and yells ""Sirius, Lily, it's Remus!""

""Everyone's here?"" Remus asks softly, not believing his luck. 

""We were all waiting for you."" James ruffles Remus' hair, then pats his back like they'd just taught the Giant Squid to play fetch again. ""We're not us without you, Remus. Never. That's true everywhere.""

""You've gone soft in your old age."" Remus says, words rocky and uneven because the sunburst of feeling in his chest is forcing its way out of him. ""What, you're a fucking poet now?""

""No, I'm twenty-one."" James says, though he sounds a lot older. ""And that means I'm entitled to be ridiculous all the time.""

""I'm thirty-seven."" Remus says. ""I'm fucking old as balls.""

""Lovely."" James winks. ""We'll make quite the pair, then.""

He barely jumps out of the way as Lily comes barreling into Remus next, a veritable hurricane of words masquerading as a conversation pouring out of her, and James looks on in mild amusement for a second before disappearing back into the cottage. Remus has hardly gotten Lily to calm down enough to leave actual spaces between her words when Sirius is standing in the doorway, staring at Remus like the universe has spat him up on their doorstep which, if Remus were to think about it in an overly mundane way, it did.

""Sirius."" Remus says, grateful, thinking of the moment Sirius had fallen through the Veil, how Remus would've pulled him back if he could. ""Sirius, I--""

""You did well with him, Remus."" Sirius comes forward slowly, places a hand on Remus' shoulder. He pats it twice, thrice, trying to appear as casual as possible, before wrapping his arms around Remus. ""You did so well, Remus.""

James joins in, resting his chin on Remus' shoulder and throwing his arms around them both. ""We couldn't have left him with anyone better, Remus."" His voice breaks slightly as he buries his face in the side of Remus' neck. ""Your Teddy would've been incredibly lucky to have you.""

""Teddy?"" Sirius asks, confused.

""My son."" Remus says, voice shaking. ""Edward Remus Lupin."" 

Lily's face falls. She'd been the only one to know how dearly Remus had wanted a child even as a child himself, how his first fear, after being turned, was that he could never be a father someday. She'd been the only one to know how jealous he'd felt, watching James with Harry and knowing that could never be his. He is perversely grateful that Teddy will never see the full moon rise with fear in his heart, but all the same, he wishes he could hold his son again, watch Teddy blow spit bubbles with his little rosebud mouth once last time.

""He's a month old next week."" Remus says hoarsely. ""And I'm never going to see him again. I watched-- I saw his mother die. He's-- He's going to have none of us.""

""I'm so sorry, Remus."" Lily joins James and Sirius, and they all hold each other like old times, James and Lily gluing Sirius and Remus together effortlessly. ""I'm so-- I'm so sorry, Remus.""

""We're all together."" Remus says, eyes brimming with tears. ""It could be so much worse.""

One moment, James, Lily and Sirius are playing a rather boring game of Connect Four Times Three, a frankly terrible game they'd devised where three separate games of Connect Four are on at a time and there are all sorts of ridiculous penalties involved for playing games in the wrong order and not knowing exactly when your turn is in each one, while Remus referees. The next, they are standing in a forest, all four of them looking around in confusion. 

And then, at once, they all notice Harry, face streaked with mud and wavy hair matted to his head by sweat and dirt. He looks old, tired, exhausted, far beyond his seventeen years, and James would've run to him if he could. From chancing a glance over at Lily, he knows she is seconds from doing the same. Instead, she holds a hand out toward Harry, an invitation left open ended. 

Harry seems amazed, entranced, for a moment, before running to Lily, eyes filled with glee. He tries to take her hand, but his hand passes through hers and he squeezes his eyes shut, like it hurts him to be reminded that she is somewhere beyond him. 

""You've been so brave, sweetheart."" She says. 

""Why are you here?"" He asks. ""All of you.""

""We never left."" Lily says with a smile.

Harry nods slowly, his breathing heavy, and takes a look around the gathering again before making a bee line for James. He is a little more hesitant, this time, not as sure what to do with his father as his mother, but when Harry and James stand together, there is no mistaking them for anything than father and son. Perhaps brothers, James looking young for twenty-one and Harry looking old for seventeen, but their ears, their long fingers, the breadth of their shoulders, are all the same. They're within an inch of each other in height, the soft slope of their noses matching near perfectly, and when they smile at each other, it is like watching a mirror be invented for the first time.

""I always wondered what you'd think of me."" Harry said.

""Wonder no more."" James intones, sounding far too dramatic, and Harry laughs Lily's laugh, shrill and screeching. ""I think you're the best thing that ever happened to me. Sorry, Lily."" James holds his hands just millimeters from Harry's shoulder, giving them both the illusion of contact that they're craving. ""You're an incredible boy. An incredible man. Any father would be proud to call you his own. And I'm not just any father. I'm yours.""

""You're proud of me."" Harry sounds almost relieved, and James wants to scream. ""You really are?""

""Honest to God."" James' voice cracks and shatters, a dinner plate thrown against a tile floor. ""I'm a lucky man. You and your mother have made sure of that."" 

Harry smiles weakly at him, reaches toward James for a second before remembering his father's embrace is a tripping hazard, that he is trying to catch smoke in his hands. Watching him pack that simple want away is nothing short of torture, watching Harry realize something so normal, something so regular, cannot and will not be his until he's dead.

""When you come to us"", James says, ""a billion, million years from now, when you've got thousands of great-great-great-grandkids or something, you'll have all you want from us. Anything you want, we'll give it to you. I promise.""

""Anything I want."" Harry says. ""That's a loaded promise.""

""I don't mind."" James smiles. ""Go, Sirius is waiting."" He points to Sirius, bouncing around antsily like a child being denied attention. ""There'll be time later.""

Harry almost laughs, a choked, wet sound tearing its way out of him, but he walks over to Sirius and Remus on unsteady legs, like a newborn foal.

""I'm sorry."" He says, sounding so like James that Lily looks to James to assure herself he is still by her side. ""I'm sorry, to both of you. You should've-- you should've had years more than you did, Sirius, and I led you to-- to what, your death? Remus, Teddy-- Teddy shouldn't have to grow up without you, he should have his parents, he should have-- he should have what I didn't.""

""Teddy has an excellent godfather who will know what he needs."" Remus says. ""One who's lived his circumstances already and knows how to make sure he'll want for nothing. And you'll have everyone there with you too. Like your mother's said -- none of us ever left. We're just selectively invisible.""

""Very funny."" Harry sniffles, then laughs wetly. ""I'm tired of looking at you, so go invisible again."" He swallows hard. ""I've, uh, I've got to die, now. That's how this ends. I don't know how much you know. If you know."" He looks around the group slowly, as if drinking the moment in. ""I'll be with you soon, I think. Hopefully he goes down without me."" He manages a wan smile. ""I just... when I get there, I'll be where you are, right?"" There is hope in his voice that James cannot bear to crush, so he nods. ""I can do this then."" He exhales slowly. ""I can-- I can do this.""

""We didn't want this to happen to you."" James says softly. ""None of us ever did. We didn't-- we didn't want you to have to--""

""I know, Dad."" Harry says, and James' heart breaks. ""We'd have a problem if you'd wanted me to die."" He tries to laugh and James is reminded of Sirius as a teenager, so unused to the idea of adults that wanted good things for him that he'd laughed in James' parents' faces when they'd suggested things so simple as eating more greens at dinner. ""Thank you. For loving me all this time. Can't have been easy.""

""It was."" Lily says. ""Every second, it was.""

""I'll be home soon."" Harry says, and it feels like a parody of a child leaving home, like the universe is jerking James and Lily around, strung up like marionettes. It feels like someone extraordinarily cruel wants them to hurt, wants them to cry, wants them to grieve for their son all over again, like the last sixteen years and nine months and some odd days haven't been just that in various shades. ""I love you. All of you. I have to-- I have to go now.""

""We'll be with you every step of the way."" James promises.

""You're never alone, Harry."" Lily adds her voice to the mix.

""And then you'll have us after."" Sirius says fiercely. ""For as long as you want.""

""Forever, if you want."" Remus says. ""Let's go.""

Harry drops the stone, and suddenly they are all back on the cottage floor, grabbing at each other's clothes and screaming. James is crying and Lily's eyes are burning with anger and Remus would've broken his first pounding it against the wall if they could break anything here. Sirius screams himself hoarse for longer than anyone else, the rebellion of noise all he had left to give, and runs circles around the cottage in the emptiness, searching for someone who isn't there. Who might never be there.

They promised him they would be there.

They promised him they would be there.

Instead, they wait up for that eighteen year old boy to appear, spend enough time lying in wait that they all grow irritable and Sirius has what sounds like an extremely vivid hallucination, and for weeks afterward they sleep in shifts, waiting, waiting, waiting for a teenager that desperately wanted nothing more than to be wanted by them to knock on the front door. 

James cannot look in the mirror and Lily cannot look at him and Sirius and Remus snap at each other like they are kids again, circling each other like vultures, each waiting for a sign of weakness from the other to pounce. It feels like the war again, feels like they are all being played against each other, but they are smarter this time, stronger. They know better. James learns to catch his reflection in windows without wincing and Lily's smiles come back eventually. Sirius' words eventually cocoon themselves in bubble wrap and Remus stops trying to destroy the cottage.

They learn to be happy with Harry not showing up, but it takes longer than they thought. They learn to be at peace with themselves, but it takes longer than they thought."

To Vernon and Petunia,

I didn't really want to write this letter (I wanted to never speak to any of you ever again) but Hermione and Ginny convinced me it might help me find closure or something, so here goes.

 

I'm seventeen now, so I'm not going to be returning to Privet Drive. I know you only took me in because Dumbledore insisted that it would help keep me safe, and now that the spell my mom cast with her love isn't going to protect me anymore, I see no reason to stay.

 

I've always wondered - did he Imperio you to keep me? Or was the letter he dropped off at your doorstep along with baby me charmed with something similar? He would never answer that question, and now that he's dead I'll never know. If he'd done that, I wish he would've cast something to make you treat me better, or at least to let me have a real bedroom. He claimed you took me in out of the kindness of your hearts, but I never saw kindness growing up at your house, so I don't believe that.

 

I've also wondered why you always treated me like shit. I'm tired of people treating me certain ways because of how they felt towards my parents. I think it's evident by now that I'm not James or Lily, and given that you two took me in when I was only a baby, it's not like I would've formed much a personality like theirs at that point. You could've raised me to hate them - instead, you just raised me to know that I was horrible because I was the offspring of Petunia's sister who she hated and some ""uncultured"" British-Indian man. (Thanks for implying that I can't be a real Briton due to my parentage, by the way.) I'm so glad my friends (my true family) and my girlfriend have shown me that I'm not the person you thought I was.

 

Maybe if you'd just allowed me some independence, allowed me contact with the world my parents came from, I would've grown up with less warped a self-image. Even if you couldn't contact Sirius until I was nearly an adult, you could've talked to Remus. Or even Hagrid, or Marlene. Just because my godfather was in jail didn't mean that there were no adults who would've wanted to help me.

 

But you didn't, and I had to find myself on my own.

 

Oh yeah, and I'm queer. Bisexual, to be specific. Hermione helped me figure out that it's okay to like both men and women even though I'm in a relationship, and she and Ginny have been helping me find support groups and stuff. So have fun with that knowledge, since I know Vernon liked to rant until he was red about queer people, which is probably why I didn't figure it out until I was fifteen.

 

If you ever realise how much you fucked up, or if Dudley wants to contact me (since I know he's only partially responsible for how he turned out, with parents like you) you can send a letter to 12 Grimmauld Place. One of my friends or my girlfriend will be looking at the letters before I do in case they're loaded with insults and profanity, just as a warning.

 

Sincerely,

Harry James Potter

Let's find us a Malfoy!""

""W-what? Why?! Rose-!""

Rose dragged Al, her helpless henchman, behind her (caring not a whit for his increasingly reddening face) as she shoved her way through the train corridor and all with a mad grin on her face.

""Aha! Found you!""

Al bumped into Rose's back, hurriedly catching his glasses before they fell, as she abruptly stalled. He stood on tiptoe, once again bemoaning Rose's early growth spurt, to catch a glimpse past her shoulder: a largely empty compartment with but a single well-cared for suitcase covered in stacks of books and one very startled bookworm.

 

""I'm sorry?""

""You! You're Scorpius Malfoy, right?""

""Y-yes?""

The combination of white-blond eyebrows and big circle glasses gave ""Scorpius"" a rather owl-like appearance. Al found himself liking the boy despite himself. He'd always rather liked owls. Then again, Al liked anyone who kept Rose's attention off himself.

Rose plonked herself on the seat opposing the blond and put an arm out in front of her. ""Scorpius"" carefully set his book aside.

""I'm Rose Granger-Weasley. My dad told me to beat you in everything.""

""I'm, er, Scorpius but... you know that already? Er..?""

Scorpius looked at Rose's hand as if it were a live squid. Al cautiously went to sit beside his cousin, nervously nudging his glasses up his nose, and whispered to the blond,

""It's a muggle thing. You're meant to shake it.""

Eyes narrowed suspiciously, Scorpius reluctantly moved to grasp Rose's hand. He slowly moved their hands to the left only to be interrupted by Rose cackling and shaking their hands up and down ""properly"".

""Ha! You're a funny one, Malfoy! Oi, Al! Don't be a stranger! Introduce yourself!""

Al jumped in his seat. He fidgeted with his glasses again before muttering his name, desperately trying to hide his growing nerves. He really wished Rose didn't drag him into her antics. Why did she have to be so utterly shameless?

Scorpius squinted at Al before murmuring his own name in response. The three sat staring at each other (or in Al's case, anywhere but at each other) before Scorpius said,

""Er, this is... nice and all but... why are you talking to me?""

Normally Rose would have gone immediately on the defensive but something about Scorpius' genuine confusion must have left her amicable. Rose laughed, her natural hair bobbing good-naturedly with her.

""I told you! My dad told me to beat you in everything!""

""Er, if your father's so against me... won't he be rather mad that you're sitting with me on the train?""

""Pssh! If he gets mad about it I'll just tell him I'm keeping an eye on you. 'Friends close, enemies closer', you know?""

Scorpius blinked at Rose, seemingly sincere, before shifting his skeptical blue eyes to Al. Al shrugged helplessly. He'd never really understood Rose either.

 

""Well! This has been fun! I'll be back in a jiff- just got to check on the rest of the gang. Merlin but there's a lot of us! You two play nice now, alright?""

Rose narrowed her eyes at Al. He nodded furiously.

And so, with as much bluster as she had entered it, Rose Granger-Weasley swept out of the compartment, reddish-brown curls bouncing behind her.

She graciously left her luggage behind for Al to deal with. He sighed, unsurprised.

 

Meanwhile, Scorpius was continuing his impression of a startled bird, brow furrowed, eyes blinking, mouth gaping slightly. Al took pity and decided to attempt some explanation. It seemed to be most of what he did as Rose's unwitting second.

""Rose is, um, always like that. My dad... he likes to say she's like some 'unholy combination' of her mum and mine. Sent to terrify the pox out of the Wizarding World, apparently.""

Al pulled at his plait, desperate to avoid eye contact, hoping madly that Scorpius would be satisfied with his rambling. Alas.

""Your dad... Harry Potter.""

""Um, yes.""

""Your dad, Harry Potter, famed hero of the Wizarding World and former arch-nemesis of my father, the school-yard bully?""

""Um, yes. Sorry.""

""Why are you sorry?! Shouldn't I be sorry-?""

""No! Um! I mean, my dad... he's always saying that we, my cousins and me, shouldn't try and relive his, um, his...""

""Heroism?""

""No! Um! I mean, kind of?""

Scorpius snorted. It was the most natural thing Al had seen him do since meeting him. It made Scorpius' nose go all wrinkly.

""My father barely talks about his school years. He goes all quiet and then he gives a speech about 'not giving into what other people expect from you' and 'respecting your own sense of morality'.""

Scorpius seemed to be somewhat bitter about all this.

""That sounds... kind of similar to what my dad says? I mean! Um, not really but... kind of?""

Scorpius raised an eyebrow and Al whimpered miserably. Oh, Merlin, how long was Rose going to take?

 

Scorpius coughed and attempting to change the subject.

""Er, I think your dad sends mine a Christmas card every year.""

How was that a change in subject? Al thought.

""R-really?"" Al managed. Why did Rose have to leave him alone with people? Now he was expected to talk!

""Yeah... It always makes my dad act... weirdly?"" Scorpius paused but continued upon Al's complete lack of verbal response, ""I, er, think he tries to hide them but Grandmother gets hold of them and... puts them on display. Er.""

Silence. Painful, pained, pain-inducing silence. Al fidgeted in his seat, sorely tempted to hide behind his luggage. Rose owed him. Scorpius, seemingly out of fatherly anecdotes, shifted in his seat. Al, terrified of boring the other boy, blurted the first thing to come to his head.

""Um. What are you reading?"" 

Al was glad the blond hadn't winced at Al raising his voice. Al never could rely on getting his speaking volume right.

""Hogwarts: A History!""

Now Scorpius winced, probably at his own eagerness, before continuing in a more mumbled fashion.

""Father told me a lot about the Wars last year but I wanted to see if he was really... er. I wanted to read what had happened for myself?""

Al happily ignored Scorpius' unconscious slip. Honestly, Al could relate. He wouldn't say that of course: if there was something that terrified Al more than having to talk to a stranger it was trying to bond with someone through familial insecurities. Al attempted to make a vague reply.

""Y-yeah. Dad sort of left all... that to Mum. Uncle Ron got there first though... His version of it is quite... um, dramatic. Aunt Hermione ended up telling us all afterward that it really involved a lot more standing around reciting spells and a bit less dragon slaying. And, um, less Uncle Ron saving the day singlehandedly.""

Scorpius smiled despite himself. He looked somewhat surprised to have done so and began blinking again. Al wondered if he should offer some eye drops.

Thankfully, Rose decided to make her dramatic return before another torturous silence could ensue.

 

""Merlin's beard, did you two talk at all while I was gone? Really, Al! Ugh, never mind that - I found one of the cool Weasleys!""

Rose stood to the side waving ""jazz arms"". Aunt Hermione had sent Rose along to muggle dance classes to help ""build confidence"". Al continued to blame muggle dance for inflicting him with Rose in all her grandeur. Rose hissed something to someone behind her before mouthing 'ta-da' just as a vaguely ginger Chinese girl stepped into view.

""Hello, Alby.""

""Molly!"" Al leapt up and was immediately swallowed in a hug.

""Shouldn't you be with the prefects? Oh, wow! You're already in-uniform and everything!"" Molly giggled as Al jimmied up and around their hug to take in her shiny new badge.

""I decided to excuse myself for a bit to see you, Alby. Not fair to leave you all alone with Miss ""I Have A Fantastic Idea"" over here-""

""Heard that, did you?"" Al muttered under Rose's offended gasp. Molly made a quick grin at Al before taking notice of the other occupant of the room.

""Oh! I see you've made a friend! Introduce me?""

""Um, this is...""

""Scorpius Malfoy."" The words came somewhere around the blond's shoulders as he had apparently tucked his head into his chest amongst all the hugging. Molly then proved exactly why she was Al's favourite cousin (take that, Rose!) by being a wonderful angel of mercy.

""Scorpius, huh? After the constellation?"" Scorpius nodded, tense. Molly gave him an encouraging smile

""Astronomy has always been my favourite subject. I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. The professor is very nice.""

Al noted that Scorpius' ears had out-rosed Rose. Al quickly kicked Rose (who had decided to sulk in a corner at Molly deciding to talk to Scorpius instead of her) in the shin before she could comment on it.

Scorpius, unknowingly rescued from Rose's teasing, braved further conversation with the kind older girl, voice only squeaking slightly.

""Er. Congratulations on being a prefect?""

""Oh! Thank you!"" Molly's eyes wrinkled as she laughed and Al could almost see the steam coming from Scorpius' ears. ""My parents are very proud! I hope you keep this friend, Alby! Scorpius and his manners should be an excellent influence on Rosie!""

Rose snorted but let the comment stand, likely only employing tact to save face in front of Molly. No one liked looking bad in front of Molly.

""Well, I've best go off and make sure no one other than Rose is causing mischief- don't worry, Rosie, I'm only mostly kidding! Be sure to find me at dinner, alright? I'll give you a wave! Oh, you too, Scorpius!""

""Bye, Molly,"" the three first-years chorused, Scorpius looking rather dazed.

 

Rose humphed back to her seat and flicked Al on the forehead. Darn, Al had hoped she's let his kick slide.

""Trust me to rely on you, Al! You haven't even put our luggage on the racks! Hmph!""

Al lamented how easily his embarrassment showed on his face. He was just as brown as his brother and sister yet somehow only he had inherited the Weasley tendency to go tomato. He did his best to hide his cheeks with the bangs that had once again escaped his braid.

Rose busied herself with setting the compartment to rights. Every time Al went to half-heartedly assist she tutted him away. Al gave up, feeling rather useless.

 

 

""Er...""

Ah, Al thought, the 'Molly Effect' ended.

""Yes, Malfoy?""

""You really don't need to call me that... er, Rose.""

""Sorry, Scorp! Got a bit used to Dad going all 'last-name basis' when talking about you and yours.""

""Right..."" Beneath his breath, Scorpius muttered something along the lines of, ""Scorp? Really?""

""Well, come on, Scorp! Out with it!"" Rose stomped in emphasis.

""Doesn't your family mind?!""

""Mind? Mind what? I thought we went over the Malfoy thing already. All I have to do-""

""No! Not that, er. Doesn't your family mind that...""

Al finally got at what Scorpius was skirting around.

""That Molly's in Slytherin?""

""Yes!"" Scorpius said, relieved not to have to ask the question himself, still somewhat pink in the ears.

Rose stepped back from the luggage rack, humming. That always meant she was taking something seriously.

""Well, there was a lot of fuss at first. Not from Cousin Molly's parents but from Dad and Uncle George. Aunt Ginny was a bit iffy too. A few others- I only know this second-hand of course, bit before my time, you understand.

""Uncle Percy - Molly's dad - well, he was always a bit of a black sheep for the family. Some tiff during the War, I think. Anyway, Uncle Percy was all about being supportive of Molly. Her mum too - was a Ravenclaw - so that's obvious enough. Mum took Molly's side too - she's always got a soft spot for underdogs - and it was a bit of a row for a while until Uncle Harry had his say.

""He mentioned you, actually, Al! You know your dad - always keeping to himself until he's suddenly all serious. He went and brought up your middle name - Al's is Severus, like Severus Snape, one of the headmasters during the War? Unfortunate, I know - and how Uncle Harry thought that if the Potters and Weasleys and all the other Gryffindor families had been less judge-y about the whole Slytherin thing, maybe Snape and some of the other Slytherins wouldn't have turned out so... difficult? I think? Then something about house rivalries fuelling sides in the War... I'm pretty sure at least half of what he said was stuff he'd sponged off Mum...""

Al had stiffened at the mention of his infamous middle name until he'd realised that his dad had meant what he'd said about not telling anyone else about his Sorting. What with Al's brother being the apparent reincarnation of Granddad James and his little sister being, well, a little sister, Al had never felt all that... special at home. Knowing that he and his dad had a secret, just between them? Well, it had done more for his confidence than he'd realised. He was a bit surprised to hear that Uncle Percy had been so supportive though. Just another example of Uncle Ron being an unreliable source of information, Al supposed.

""Anyway, Uncle Harry's little bit settled it and then Grandma Molly - that's who Molly's named after - put her foot down and said that 'A Weasley's a Weasley no matter what colours they're wearing'! So it ended up that it was all sort of sorted - heh, sorted - before the family had even owled Molly back!""

""Wow.""

""Yeah! Exciting, right?""

""I guess? I just... I hope my family will be as accepting. If I don't get sorted into Slytherin, I mean.""

""Oh! Is your dad hassling you about it? I know my dad was still trying to do the whole 'Join us on the Gryffindor side!'-thing.""

Al winced at Rose's awful impersonation of her father. For some reason she always made Uncle Ron sound a lot shriekier and menacing than he was.

Scorpius surprised them by shaking his head.

""Actually, I think Father would be fine with it. It's just my grandparents I worry about. I just don't want to disappoint them.""

They all went solemn then. Grandparents were serious. Al wasn't sure how he would cope if he ended up being the only Weasley without a sweater on Christmas. Being without a jumper from Grandma was almost worse than being disowned! Rose nodded to herself, likely thinking the same thing Al was thinking, before jumping to her feet.

""Well! That was depressing! Why don't we play a game to cheer ourselves up?""

Al nodded eagerly: anything to avoid having to do more talking. Scorpius made a weak smile before saying,

""As long as it's not Exploding Snap. I'd like to keep my eyebrows intact on my first day of school, thanks.""

That got a smile out of everyone and Al relaxed. Perhaps he wouldn't have to suffer Rose's tyranny alone this year. In fact, having Scorpius around would mean Al would have another human to hide behind when James (inevitably) tried to challenge Rose for leadership of the younger Weasleys!

Perhaps Hogwarts wouldn't be too awful after all."

Great Hall, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Scotland







31
st
 June 2025




Padma Patil, former Ravenclaw prefect and daughter of the Indian Magical Ambassador, was happy. Her fiance, Ravenclaw Head Girl Rose Granger-Potter, was graduating today and Padma had been invited to it by her.

Today was also a first for the British Wizarding Nation as it would be the first marriage allowed on this day between two witches, making Padma excited.

It was all thanks to a campaign led by her future father-in-law and fellow classmate, Harry Potter, the Minister of Magic. He, along with his wife, Hermione Granger, had spearheaded the creation of a 'Marriage for All Act', a law created in order to allow the joining of not just heterosexual, but also homosexual couples in matrimony.

Padma remembered how she had first met Rose. She had attended a Weird Sisters concert two years ago and it was there that she first met the bushy haired teen. They swapped Floo addresses and had been seeing each other for a year, before Albus Potter, Rose's half-brother, found out about the couple.

Rose and Padma talked to their parents, admitting their love for each other and initially Rakesh Patil, Padma's father, refused to allow her to continue in the relationship, but Padma won out in the end.

As the graduation speeches ended, Padma looked into the chocolate brown eyes of her lover and smiled, knew that she was happy. As the Minister for Magic rose, Padma heard the reason for him to rise and was ready to be called by him.

""Today we call for Miss Rose Granger-Potter and Miss Padma Patil to come forth in order to celebrate their union together."" Harry said, smiling at his future daughter-in-law and his daughter.

Padma saw her fiance smile, kissing her on the lips in front of the assembled students, staff and dignitaries. Who knew that the two of them would be Ravenclaw students who were happy together."

The snow drifts reached almost up to the knees of Regulus Black as he struggled to keep up with his older sibling on the poorly kept cobbles of Nocturn Alley.



Christmas shopping with the Carrows were a tradition designed by their mother and father to get the two Black children out of Grimauld Place to allow Kreacher to decorate the place to Walburga's preferences. The place would look beautiful when they returned later that afternoon, Regulus knew. It would be filled with garlands of holly and evergreens, ribbons and candles; a Christmas tree, hung with candy canes, beaded peacocks made with real feathers and strings of pearls. There would be presents under the tree - books, fine robes, maybe toys, and cards with brand new galleons spellotaped to the insides.



 Regulus was snapped out of his thoughts of hot butterbeer and tinsel when his winter boot slipped on a wet patch of snow, whipping it out from underneath him and sending him headlong into the snowy street. The cold and wet of it, the sudden immersion, shocked him, and he cried out for his sibling. 


 


""Siri!""


 


Sirius Black was walking a few paces behind the two Carrow youths - twin sister and brother, Alecto and Amycus - their hands shoved deep into the pockets of their winter cloak, and their hat pulled down over their forehead in a bid to hide their mullet of a haircut, as well as a yellowing bruise above their left eye.



 All three stopped and turned around to find Regulus sprawled out in the muddy snow-slush, covered head to toe in the freezing slurry. The Carrows giggled gleefully into their mittens as Sirius turned on their heel and marched back to pull the boy up by his wet sleeve, his bottom lip quivering, bare hands turning red with cold.


 


""You are in trouble now, little Reggie,"" cackled Alecto.


 


""Walburga is going to whip you for messing up your robes,"" Amycus agreed.


 


Regulus' eyes went wide with fear, as he stared at the two, then at Sirius, who was doing their best trying to brush the snow and dirt off the front of their brother's wet robes.



He looked so scared, and it hit Sirius like a bludger to the heart.



They had already cried themselves to sleep together in Sirius' bed four days ago.



 That afternoon they had played hide and go seek, when Regulus had broken a crystal cup while climbing into a cabinet to hide, in the formal reception room. Sirius had taken the blame, and the punishment, but Regulus had cried the hardest. Sirius hadn't even bothered to put dittany, or even ice, on their eye, instead they had taken their little brother straight to their bed, where they held him while he cried until he fell asleep.



Then they themself had cried, in silence, gently stroking their little brother's hair, until they too fell asleep. 



 Now they crouched down and placed both hands on Regulus' shoulders, locking eyes.


 


""Reg, look at me, no she is not, don't worry about it, come on.""


 


They swivelled on their heels, gesturing for the boy to climb on their back, and he obeyed, stifling a sob, as he wrapped his arms around his older sibling's neck. Sirius in turn wrapped their arms around each of his legs, and pushed themself up, stumbling once, twice, before finding their balance, and kept heading up the street towards Diagon Alley.



 The two Carrows let them catch up to them, then fell into step on either side of them.


 


""Where are we going?"" Amycus asked.


 


""To the Leaky Cauldron.""


 


""What good is that going to do?"" Alecto inquired.


 


Hiking the sniffling Regulus up higher on their back, Sirius sighed.


 


""Get warm and dry, for one. You coming?""


 


""It's 'are you coming', 

for one

,"" Amycus muttered under his breath, but shuffled, albeit grumpily, after the Black siblings together with his sister.


 


***


 


The windows at the Leaky Cauldron were fogged up with the condensation from dozens of wet winter cloaks drying on warming bodies in the heat of the blazing fireplace, filling the air with the smell of wet wool and leather, as well as mulled wine and roast. It was crowded with Christmas shoppers and their bulging bags, their squawking owls and babbling children. Goblins and wizards alike were huddled around tables full of pints and pub-grub, illuminated by lamps and Christmas lights alike.



 The four children pushed their way towards the bar, where Tom, the landlord, was chatting away with his patrons.



Sirius put Regulus down on an unoccupied barstool and looked around for a familiar face, any familiar face would do, at this point. Fortunately, Merlin must have been smiling down upon them, because just then they spotted a face they would recognise anywhere; across the bar, a tall bespectacled wizard raised his hand to flag down Tom in the hustle and bustle, tufts of his dark, thick hair sticking up in all directions after having worn a hat all morning. Fleamont Potter's likeness to his son was uncanny - or his son's likeness to him was, Sirius supposed they should say - except for James's dark complexion and the bend in his nose, which he had clearly inherited from his mother.



 Sirius had always liked the elder Potters, and right now they were happier than ever to see them. Heaving themself up on the bar, leveraged on straight arms and leaning in past the other patrons, they called out:


 


""Mr Potter! Mr Potter, sir!""


 


Fleamont scanned the bar until his eyes met Sirius'. Immediately his face lit up, and he waved, before turning around to talk to someone else over his shoulder. When he turned back around he gestured for Sirius to come over, pointing to indicate that corner of the bar, where, presumably, there was a table.



 Sirius hopped back down onto the sticky floorboards and helped their brother off the barstool, turning to the Carrow twins:


 


""You coming?""


 


Alecto and Amycus crossed their arms in perfect unison.


 


""You know,"" Alecto started, ""those no-good blood traitors you call friends are making you common, you can tell from the way you speak.""


 


""No wonder your parents are ashamed of you,"" Amycus continued, ""socialising with half-bloods and mudbloods, acting like a poofter...""


 


""Watch it, Carrow!"" Sirius bit back, ""the Potters are part of the Sacred Twenty-eight, just like you and I.""


 


""So are the Prewetts.""


 


""And the McKinnons.""


 


""And the Weasleys.""


 


""That doesn't stop them from being blood traitors.""


 


""They are blood traitors, Lupin is a half-blood and Evans is a mudblood.""


 


Stepping in front of Regulus, putting themself between him and the Carrows, and angling him away from the two blondes, Sirius leaned in and hissed through their teeth:


 


""Look, you blast-ended skanks, you want to talk about blood? Snivellus Snape is a half-blood too, you don't seem to mind his greasy beak up your arse eight days a week. And keep my friends' names out of your mouths if you know what's best for you.""


 


The superior grin on the twins' faces did not falter as they gave each other a smug look, unfazed by both the name they'd been called, and the threat levelled against them.


 


""Oh, don't you worry your pretty little head about Severus Snape,"" Alecto smirked. ""What he lacks in blood-status, he makes up for in other ways, just ask Mulciber next time you see him.""


 


""And as for your little friends, us 

talking

 about them will be the 

least

 of their problems, before long,"" Amycus added, the same malevolent mirth playing across his face. ""So get your act together, Black, and do it quickly, if 

you 

know what is best for 

you

.""


 


The three stared each other down for a moment, neither of them willing to concede, to break away first.



 But their face-off was settled for them by the arrival of Fleamont Potter, who had made his way through the crowd when Sirius failed to appear at their table. All four children flinched at the sudden voice from above them:


 


""Sirius, where ever did you go?"" Then, ""Gosh, there are more of you! Hello there, Carrow, I presume?"" He held out his hand to the two, and to Sirius surprise, and, frankly, amusement, they both took it. They bowed and curtsied, mumbling greetings and wishes for a happy Christmas, before excusing themselves, and disappearing into the crowded tavern.



 Fleamont watched them leave, somewhat perplexed, then turned to Sirius, and the now shivering Regulus standing beside them, holding onto their arm.


 


""Are they not joining us?"" He asked, but upon seeing the state of the younger Black's robes he seemed to forget about them instantly.



""Oh dear, what in Merlin's beard has happened to you, young man?""


 


***


 


At a cosy table near the far corner of the Leaky Cauldron, with a bench seat against the wall, Euphemia Potter and her son, James, welcomed the addition of the two siblings. In fact, they had already bought a round of hot butterbeer, which was now sitting on their table, waiting as well.


 


""We seem to be in need of some clean-up,"" Fleamont announced, gesturing to the youngest of them.



It was then that Regulus finally started to cry, turning to bury his mucky face in Sirius' scarf.


 


""

Mama

 is going to flay us!"" Came a muffled whimper. 


 


 Euphemia was on her feet immediately, putting her arm around Regulus' shoulders and steering him towards their table.


 


""

Oh pyaare

! 

Oh

,

 bachche

, 

roo mat

... 

Roo mat

..."" And with a wave of her wand she had cleaned him up; with another, dried his robes, and with a third, done the same for Sirius, who was indeed quite wet and dirty themself after carrying their little brother.


 


 Soon, the three Hogwarts students were sitting on the bench seat, Regulus fitting comfortably between his sibling and their friend, sipping their butterbeer and chatting happily.



 He was ashamed about having cried in front of the Potters, Sirius knew.



Despite being favoured by their parents, Regulus felt the oppressive terror as much as Sirius did, but whereas Sirius pushed back, Regulus buckled. He both looked and acted younger than he was. After all, there were only two years between them, but, as Sirius had had to grow up fast to protect their brother, Regulus had become somewhat stunted.



 But sitting in-between themself and James in the warm glow of the decorated  tavern, he seemed to come to life; chatting animatedly, cheeks rosy, smile wide, eyes bright. James, too, seemed to enjoy himself. He didn't treat Regulus like a little child, he talked to him like an equal, more so, even, than Sirius did.



If they could just stay like this forever - warm, content, safe, happy...


 


""So, boys, when are you meeting up with your mother and father?"" Euphemia asked, shattering their dreamy pondering at once.


 


Their mother and father. They had lost the Carrows a long time ago, finding them now would be hopeless, if they were even still in Diagon Alley.



They were meant to Floo home from Borgin and Burke's at five o'clock, no earlier, no later. As long as Alecto and Amycus didn't tattle to their parents, maybe they would get away with it...



It certainly was a good sign that neither Walburga or Orion had yet shown up to flog them right then and there, that meant that the Carrows had not, yet at least, told their parents of their exchange, and subsequent departure.



But now Sirius' blood ran cold.


 


""What time is it?""


 


Fleamont reached into his robes and took out an ornate pocket watch.


 


""Five ten,"" he declared. ""Have you finished your Christmas shopping? If not, you have less than an hour before things close around here."" 


 


""SHI--!"" Shooting out of their seat with such force that they rattled the tabel Sirius clapped both hands over their mouth to stop themself from swearing. ""Reggie, we've got to go, grab your cloak, 

now

!"" They turned towards the bar, ""Tom, Floo powder, now, 

please

!""


 


Regulus flew out of his seat, swinging his cloak over his shoulders in the process and practically leaping towards the fireplace while Sirius rushed to the bar, flanked by James, ready to help if he could.


 


""Hey, hey, hey! Lads, what's going on?"" Fleamont stood up, gesturing, with the palms of his hands facing the floor, for the frantic teenagers to calm down.


 


""We're late, Sir, and we'll be in trouble if we don't hurry home,"" Regulus explained, with only a fraction of vibrato in his voice, hopping from one foot to the other in front of the fire.


 


Before any of the elder Potters could get another word in, the older boys pushed past the table with a clatter of chair legs and winter boots on the floorboards.



James pushed a handful of Floo powder into Regulus' hands and gave the boy a one-armed hug, then he hugged Sirius and wished them good luck.



With that, the Black siblings turned to the roaring flames, threw the Floo powder down, took each other's hands and stepped into the fireplace, calling out:


 


""12 Grimauld Place!""


 


And with a rush of green sparks they were gone.


 


***


 


The countryside outside of Woking was much colder than the city of London. Here, the snow lay mostly undisturbed over the fields and hills, save for the tracks and trails of creatures great and small that crisscrossed the land.



It was dark now, the sky thick with snow-heavy clouds, only illuminated in parts of the horizon by the yellowish light from the cities beyond. Occasionally there were twinkles of light from neighbouring farms and cottages, appearing as mere fairy lights in the distance, from where Euphemia was standing, by the tall front room windows.



She was holding a large cup of tea with both hands, watching how the strands of steam rising from it condensed on the cold glas, when movement in the reflection of the sparsely lit room caught her eye and made her turn around.



Her son was standing in the door, a deep furrow between his brows.


 


""

Pyaare bachche

, what's on your mind?"" 


 


Smiling warmly, she held out her hand towards the boy, beckoning him to come to her.



He obeyed, letting his mother put her arm around him as he joined her by the window. She continued:


 


""Are you worried about your friends?""


 


James made a noncommittal noise in the back of his throat by way of an answer, so Euphemia continued:


 


""They are nice boys. Are their parents... nice, as well?""


 


""You know of the Black family..."" James supplied.


 


His mother sighed loudly and turned to face him, pinning him with that knowing look only mothers learn to perfect.


 


""James, 

main ek bevakooph nahin hoon

, I saw the bruise on Sirius' face, and I know fear when I see it, and those boys were terrified. 

Mujhe batao

, are their parents hurting them?""


 


""Mom, you can't tell anyone!""


 


""That's a 'yes', then?""


 


""They don't hurt Reggie, but they can get very angry, Sirius takes the brunt of it, but please don't get involved, it'll just make it worse.""


 


""

Bhagavana

, James, that's not right!""


 


""I 

know

, mom!""


 


They were raising their voices now, and the escalating commotion finally reached the ears of Fleamont, who appeared in the door, with a tray of mulled cider and bakewell tarts, now demanding to know what on earth they were fighting about.


 


""Darling, you know what these old English pureblood families are like, we might indeed make it worse by interfering,"" he admitted, once the others had filled him in on their discussion.



He set the tray down on the side table between the armchairs, taking a seat, as well as a glass mug of cider, stirring it slowly with a cinnamon stick. 


 


""Sirius is a good lad, and his little brother is a delight, and so polite, but I know Walburga and Orion, and I think James is right - upsetting this particular apple cart may have repercussions beyond that of the safety of the two Black brothers. Honey, please.""


 


Euphemia was rubbing her forehead above the eyes with the thumb and forefinger of one hand, pacing up and down in front of the fireplace and muttering under her breath in Hindi.



 However, upon seeing the look on her husband's gentle face, she sighed with resignation, and returned his loving look.



He held out a mug of cider towards her, and she took it, taking a seat herself in the second armchair and taking a sip of the warm, fruity potion.


 


""Fine,"" she gave Fleamont a sideways glance over the rim of her mug, ""but we're extending a standing invitation to both of those boys. They can visit any time, without prior notice.""


 


""With permission from their parents,"" countered Fleamont, raising his cider, index finger extended, to make his point.


 


""And they can stay the night,"" added Euphemia.


 


The two Potters smiled at each other, and both raised their mugs in agreement.



 Fleamont turned to James, who had been sitting on the rug in front of the fireplace with his own mug of cider, watching his parents talk for the last half hour, thinking in silence.


 


""Jamie, my lad, will you write to Sirius in the morning, please, and let him know?""


 


""Sure,"" the boy nodded, and after a beat of hesitation he added: ""But there's something you probably should know...""


 


His parents exchanged a look, both furrowing their brows as they turned back towards him to let him continue.



 James took a deep breath, he wasn't sure how to explain this to his ageing parents, but if they were to offer Sirius a safe place where they could take refuge, then he wanted to make sure that the Potter estate was just that - safe - so he pressed on:


 


""Mom. Dad. Sirius is not a boy, or a girl...""


 


***


 


Lyall and Hope Lupin had built their little house themselves about eight years ago, deliberately off the beaten path, in the Welsh countryside.



 It was quiet, save for the birds, chirping in the garden around the birdfeeder, and the occasional motor vehicle passing on the distant highway.



 Remus pulled the duvet off his head, hair in an impressive disarray even for him, to find himself bathed in the golden light of a sunbeam, the dust in the air glittering around him like a strange and unfamiliar spell. It had pierced through his dream, where he had been on the Hogwarts Express with his friends, just as it sped out of a tunnel into the bright September sunshine. In the dream he had been asleep in his seat while his friends were all laughing and talking around him, and much like right now in his bed, the sun had woke him up as it suddenly shone in his face. Just before he woke, he saw, in the seat across from his dream-self, Sirius laughing at something one of the others had said. Their hair was long, past their ears again, and pulled back from their face with clips. They turned towards him, still smiling brightly, and said something...



Remus wasn't sure whether he'd just not heard what they'd said, or if he'd woken up before they said it, but whatever it was, it was gone, and the rest of the dream was fading fast.



 Somewhere downstairs he could hear his mother moving around, and the faint sound of Christmas songs on the radio.



He flopped onto his back on the bed with a sigh. They always let him sleep in, in the days after the Moon, but, given the Sun's position in the sky, it must be more than time to get up. He closed his eyes again and tried to recall dream-Sirius' face. He wondered if their hair really would have grown out that much over the winter break, and if they would really look that happy and healthy in a week's time when they'd all meet up on Platform 9 3/4 . Their many letters, notes and cards hadn't suggested any further spontaneous make-overs at the hands of Mrs Black, but given her famously unpredictable temper, that could still change in a week.



He wondered how many letters Marlene had received. Had they been writing sickly sweet love letters to each other every day?



 Remus groaned and threw his duvet off the bed, giving it a kick as he used the momentum to lever himself up into sitting on the bedside.



It was cool in the room despite the bright sunlight, and he slipped a pair of long woolly socks on before sticking his feet into the threadbare slippers by his bed. Before he left his room he also pulled a too-big jumper over his head on top of his pyjamas to lock in some of the warmth from his bed



 James would have gotten letters from Sirius every day, they were inseparable, more like twins than friends, but he'd never reflected over the frequency of their correspondence like he now did with regards to Marlene, and it bothered him. He'd always considered her a good friend, but the last couple of months he found himself irrationally annoyed by the mere mention of her. 



Once again, he was being unfair, and he didn't like this side of himself. It added another layer to the shame he already felt. So he bypassed the bathroom, with its mirror, and went straight downstairs. 


 


Hope looked up from her papers, when he walked into the kitchen, and smiled.


 


""Morning

, cariad

, 

ffansi paned

?""


 


""Please,"" he smiled back at her, but immediately flinched and sucked a breath in through his teeth.


 


A fresh, deep slash trailed down the side of his neck, under his ear from his cheek. Instinctively, he raised his hand to touch the burning cut. It was going to scar, he was sure of it. Another reason to avoid the bathroom mirror.



 His mother made a sound of sympathetic pity, leaving the kettle on the cooker to take his hand off his face, but he ducked out of her reach.


 


""Let me look, del,"" she scolded, but he pushed her hand away when she tried again to reach for him.


 


""It's fine, mum, leave it.""


 


Hope looked unconvinced, perhaps even hurt by his rejection, but she sighed in resignation and appeared to let it go, at least for now. Instead, she poured a large mug of tea and placed it on the table for Remus.



While he sat, she topped up her own mug and fetched a bottle of milk from the fridge.


 


""Did you sleep well?"" Hope tried again.


 


""Yes, thank you,"" Remus felt guilty for not letting his mother tend to his wounds, but on balance, he felt like a burden for having inflicted them in the first place. There was no winning this internal battle he was fighting. He pressed on, hoping to talk about anything else but himself and how he was doing:


 


""What are you grading?""


 


Hope had taken a job as a muggle primary school teacher once he had started Hogwarts. Up until then, she had stayed home to look after him, leaving her husband to provide for the three of them with his ministerial research grant.


 


""Oh, I'm not grading, dear, these children are too young to be graded"", she took a sip of her tea, ""I'm just going over their report books for half-term"".


 


Remus stared at her. Did she think that made sense to him?


 


""What?""


 


""Hm?"" Hope looked back up from the thin notebook in which she was writing. 



""Oh! The children write these letters to their teacher, and we write back to them."" She picked her mug up with both hands, mirroring his own stance with her elbows resting on the table.



""We have books for the parents too, so that we can... talk to both parents and children, without the interruption of the other.



They aren't meant to read each other's letters, and we don't tell them what the other writes, unless there's a good reason for us to do so... it's to make sure everyone's... happy, I suppose you could say.""


 


Remus thought about it for a moment, taking another slow sip of tea.


 


""Is that... normal? Do all muggle schools do that?""


 


""I honestly don't know, 

cariad

, I've only ever worked at this one."" She smiled, her open, honest face looked content.


 


Maybe he needn't worry about being a burden to his mother.



She seemed happy, now, that he was away from home, from her, most of the time.



Maybe once he was done with Hogwarts he'd finally move away for good. They could be happy, then, his parents; they could have a normal life at last, without him around.

Greeting each other like old friends, James took Death's hand and followed. Passed over, some would say. But the ugly truth of it was...

James Potter was dead.

He opened his eyes and he was suddenly in the backyard of his childhood home. He looked around, not seeing anyone.


Did Lily make it? Did Hari?


""James."" A soft voice called out. 

James froze, instantly recognizing that voice. How he had longed to hear that voice again. But why like this?

James was terrified to turn around, knowing he wouldn't be able to keep himself together. 

He was about to say something when he felt him grab his hand. Tears immediately started welling up in James' eyes and he turned, attacking the smaller boy in a hug.

""Merlin, I've missed you."" James whispered into Regulus' hair.

Regulus beamed, ""I have as well.""

James held Reg tightly, never wanting to let go. He was terrified that once he did, Reg would disappear. Vanish. Maybe this was all some dream, maybe-

Regulus pulled back and cupped James' cheek, ""You've gotten older."" He teased.

""You haven't aged a day."" James said back.

Regulus smiled sadly, ""Yeah... that happens.""

James snorted, ""Still cynical, even in death.""

""Oh, you know it."" Regulus nodded.

James admired Regulus. He still had those beautiful, stormy eyes, gorgeous curly hair and a smile that could light up any room.

""So this is the Potter mansion huh? Didn't think I'd have to see it like this."" Regulus said, a sad smile on his face. 

""Yeah. I've always loved it here. Lotta good memories."" James reflected. ""Where were you before?"" A smirk crept onto Regulus' face and he grabbed James' hand. The familiar feeling of apparition overwhelmed James but...softer. They materialized on the rocky bank of a crystal clear river shimmering in the sun. Regulus had a wide smile on his face and led James over to a rope swing hanging off a large oak tree. 

""Here, I'll push you!"" Regulus said excitedly. James walked around the swing and took a seat on the wooden plank, gripping the frayed rope. Once he was situated Regulus ran forward, running out the front, and taking his place back behind james. He whooped with glee as he soared through the air. It was pure bliss and for a moment things were joyous and he felt free. 

After a few more swings he dragged his feet on the bank and hopped off the swing. Regulus was still smiling brightly. 

""Sirius and I used to come here, when we were little. It stopped after he..."" Regulus shook his head out. ""It's been nice to be back here."" 

James nodded in understanding. He knew all about Sirius running away, having housed him. He took Regulus' hand and kissed it, ""It's brilliant.""

Regulus turned and looked at James, smiling. His eyes darted down to James' lips and a small blush appeared on his cheeks.

James noticed the look and nodded a confirmation. He leaned in slowly, heart beating fast. He had waited for this moment since forever. He was finally able to be with the love of his life again.

They were millimeters apart and...

It all started to fade away.

James' eyes widened and he started to panic, ""Reg?""

Regulus was disappearing and.... Oh fuck, oh fuck.

""Regulus, no!"" James cried out, tearing up again. This couldn't be happening.

Soon, he was in a field of flowers. James looked around in front of him, not being able to see Regulus, but then...

""James?"" A feminine voice said. 

James spun around quickly and there was his wife. His wife.

""Lily... oh... oh no, Lily."" James' world was burning around him. Lily was dead. Hari was defenceless, alone with...

He was interrupted by Lily rushing at him and tackling him into a hug.

""Hari lived."" Lily said, tearfully. ""Our boy is okay.""

""I... wh-what?"" James was overwhelmed. He didn't know how to react to anything. Was he to be in despair about being ripped away from Regulus? Worried that his wife was dead? Happy that Hari was alive? He felt lightheaded. Can you feel lightheaded in death?

Next thing thing he knew, everything was black.

James opened his eyes and there stood Death in front of him.

Death was cold. Commanding. Fearing.

Death was death.

""Why? Why do you play such a cruel trick on me?"" James asked, unusually calm.

Things work differently here. A voice said, seeming to come from nowhere.

""How? Is my wife dead? Can I see Regulus again? Is Hari-""


Hari is well. Distressed, but alive.


That eased James. At least that was real. ""What about Lily? Was that real?""


Lily is dead. She died protecting your son. She is what saved him.


James closed his eyes. Lily was real as well.

""And... and what about Regulus?"" James said.


What about him?


""Is... why... can..."" James didn't know what to ask.


Soulmates, dear James. When one dies, they are sent to their soulmate. Regulus has waited to be reunited with you.


""Then why was I sent to Lily?""


You are Lily's soulmate.


James was confused. Regulus was his soulmate, but he was Lily's? It didn't make sense.


You may see him again. You may visit whoever you like. But once you are ready, you will rest. You will be in peace.


""You mean this isn't it. This isn't the end?"" James asked.


Not until you decide that it is the end.


""Can... Can I be with both of them?"" James asked. 

Death raised his hand and suddenly, James was back in the field, two faces staring down at him.

""Bloody idiot's only reaction to things is passing out.""

""I know. He passed out when we found out you died.""

""I saw that."" A laugh.

""You saw- oh wait, he's opening his eyes.""James blinked a few times, and a worried Lily and Regulus were peering down at him. Regulus offered him a hand up and Lily immediately peppered him in questions and a kiss to the cheek. 

""I was worried for a minute!"" She said, now smiling softly. ""Hari's alive, love. And we're both...together."" Even in death her optimism shone through. ""And here nonetheless! I used to come here with Pet and mum and dad. We'd camp here."" 

""That's lovely. Want to have a look around?"" James asked, extending a hand. Lily smiled but shook her head. 

""I want to look for a moment. Just remember."" She said. James nodded. And Regulus, nodded just so, smiling at Lily. She walked off into the field and Regulus turned to James. They both spoke at the same time. 

""I talked to death-""

""James-"" Regulus blinked at him. ""Well you have the floor."" He said incredulously. 

""I talked to death, and we're soulmates. But Lily's my soulmate too."" he finished. Regulus nodded. 

""I know."" He gave a sad smile. James wasn't sure what to say. He couldn't well choose between his first love and his last. Luckily Regulus picked up. ""Choose her.""

""But-""

""You won't decide James. So I'm telling you to choose her. Don't get hung up on me. I'll still be here. But it's you two."" James reached out to put a hand on his arm but Regulus stepped back. He sighed, eyes darting up at James again and he gave him a quick and tight hug. 

""I want you to be happy. And you'll have that with her."" He said in only a whisper, but the words reverberated in James' ear. He understood. 

Regulus loved him. 

James nodded, ""Will I see you again?""

""Of course. I'm gonna be annoying you for eternity. It's my job now."" Regulus grinned.

""Dork."" James laughed.

""You know it."" Regulus said quieter. He looked back at Lily who was still exploring. ""Go be happy, James.""

""I love you, Reg.""

""I know."""

Chapter 1


 


Dhatura Lily Potter supposed she should have seen all of this coming. She 

seemed

 to have the worst luck in the world, and the weirdest things just

 seemed

 to happen to her, all on their own.


 


It wasn't her fault, at least she believed so. She never asked for any of this to happen, she couldn't control any of it. She knew she was just a little girl, and it all just plain sucked.


 


Her life, as long as she could remember, had been utter shite. As if her parents being dead, and living with the most awful family in England wasn't enough, now she was left behind and homeless on the bloody streets of London. 


 


She knew she was odd, but no one deserved this. These 

things

... they just 

happened

 and it wasn't like she could control it. This time, it had cost her food and a home to live in, not that the Dursley's was any sort of home for her.


 


See, when Dhatura's parents had died, she had been left upon the doorstep of her aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon. Aunt Petunia had been her mother's sister, and so responsibility had been handed to them. In kind, they reluctantly took her in, which was evident in how they treated her, and especially when Uncle Vernon was incensed enough to hurt her, which wasn't exactly rare. 


 


To them, she was a burden risen up from the highest evils of hell and she was handled as such. Despite having several other spare rooms in their spacious suburban paradise, she was shoved to the cupboard underneath the stairs, to live with the spiders and dust. She was hardly ever given much, so the only things that had resided in her box was her mandatory school uniform, dyed grey hand-me-downs from her cousin, books given to her by sympathetic teachers and a worn blanket and pillow. 


 


As a young child, she'd had no idea this was abnormal, until she truly thought about the differences between her and the precious Dudley Dursley, and why they so despised the girl's very presence.


 


Well, for one, she wasn't white. Her father, as much as she could figure, was of Indian descent , considering her Aunt Petunia, who never spoke a word about her parents, was as pale as the moon above, she guessed her father was of Indian heritage or something close to that. 


 


It also had to do with all of the weird things that had happened to her throughout her short lifetime. For example, when she was left at their doorstep, she also came with a scar on her forehead, in the shape of a lightning bolt and unnaturally green eyes. Dhatura thought it was rather cool looking, but the Dursley's believed it was grossly abnormal for a little girl to have a scar, and it was therefore labeled ""ugly"" and her aunt forced her to hide it behind unruly black bangs. 


 


Then one time, Dudley, her cousin, had stuck gum into her hair, to which Petunia then cut her hair into a horrid bowl cut that refused to stay flat. As much as Dudley had laughed and she had cried that night, it had miraculously grown back overnight after having an amazing dream about a flying motorbike and a giant friendly black dog. Dhatura had thanked whatever god or goddess that had answered her prayer. Then again, she had also gotten locked in her cupboard for a week without food privileges. 


 


This time, however, her weirdness had come with truly dire consequences. 


 


She had been exiting her school building for the day in mid-September, after having talked with the school librarian about the Nancy Drew books that she so loved, when Dudley and his stupid gang of bullies, of which he was the leader, had begun to chase her around the school. She dove behind the trash bins just next to the kitchen door, but found herself on the roof of the school, just above the kitchens, witnessed by many of the residents in the neighborhood.


 


That's when the Dursley's and their 'bizarrely delinquent niece' had been quite literally the talk of the town. This gossip enraged them and she was pushed violently into the wall the moment she got home, and dragged by her hair into the cupboard again, listening to the harsh whispers that came from the living room for days upon days. The next few days she was lucky if Uncle Vernon would throw her a bloody apple, if anything at all. 


 


Then, there had been all of the rukus outside of her cupboard for several days in a row, thumping down the stairs multiple times a day, until everything was silent. Every once in a while, Dhatura could hear Vernon muttering ""freak"" or ""... tried to stomp it out...""


 


Then there was nothing except the fading sound of a car engine.


 


For days, no words were heard, nor the telly going off, absolutely nothing. Not even an inkling of Vernon getting too drunk and smashing glasses, or Dudley throwing a fit for more food. 


 


Panic seized her. 


 


She was trapped in a small box, and presumably left behind, at the age of 8. 


 


Instinct grabbed her. She rattled at the locked door, as tears poured down like lava released from her eyes. 


 


She thrashed wildly, like a caged animal abused for far too long. Minutes felt like years, trapped in a hell that she did not deserve.


 


After banging one last time, the door's lock cracked as it unlocked and it flew open, hitting the wall with a loud bang and caused Dhatura to jump back and flinch.


 


A few moments later when the coast seemed to be clear, Dhatura slivered her eyes open just a bit. The door had opened... but no one was there to open it from the outside... 


 


Of course, the young girl had simply chalked it up to the weird things she couldn't control and climbed out of the cupboard. She had no reason to believe it was anything otherwise.


 


The house was... empty. Not a soul or even object remained. 


 


She didn't know what to do. On one hand, the Dursleys were horrid, and she felt herself slump a little in relief. Of course, her life would look up a little bit since those vile people were gone, but she was left with so many questions. What was going to happen to the house? What did they think was going to happen to her after they left her there to die? What was she going to do? 


 


She felt confused. She supposed she had to come up with a plan.


 


All this, and she was only bloody 8 years old.


 


***



She didn't have many choices, so she went with the most sensible of them.


 


Dhatura cleaned out her school bag, which held her work and a few books to read. She kept the books, but left everything else laid out on the table of the kitchen. 


 


Then, she took all of her belongings, considering she had next to nothing anyway, and stuffed them in, jamming her ratty blanket and pillow deep next to her ugly oversized clothes from her ugly oversized cousin. 


 


What was to come next had been banking on what little luck she'd had and every bit of building karma she was owed from such a damning universe to treat her so cruelly. 


 


In the dead of night, as not to get caught by any peeping neighbor, Dhatura snuck off to Surrey Station. She knew it was useless being 'homeless' in the middle of a suburb, because most people only cared about their garden and whatever have you. 


 


She snuck around the crowded train station, stealing some crisps and a bottle of water out of a sleeping woman's purse while she slept soundly on the bench.


 


With no money, Dhatura snuck past ticket agents, and hid in the bathroom on the emptiest car, saying she was motion sick, until she ran off the train as soon as it stopped. She felt residual guilt, at the mixture of taking up the bathroom and not paying for the ticket, but she simply had no other choice.


 


She ripped out of the bathroom like a bat outta hell. Shouldering her bag, she darted straight into the dangers of London. 


 


***


 


Being homeless... was hard, but that was quite expected. 


 


Dhatura would never admit this, but as much as she hated the Dursleys, she missed being able to eat a good, solid meal, at least every once in a while, and having a roof over her head.


 


She also missed showering. That was nice while it lasted. 


 


It was a few months away from being 3 years she became homeless, abandoned and a runaway all at once. It was the beginning of June, and in a bit less than two months, Dhatura would be 11. 


 


It had been three years of survival, and she continued to count her blessings as they came, as she refused to become as bitter as Petunia had been. Wandering the streets all those years ago, she continued her brief luck streak from right off the train, and didn't die. In fact, in those months to come, she had found a small niche with a group of other homeless people, including Agnes and her 2-year old Heather, Mitchell the ex-accountant, Robert, or Raz, a kid kicked out of his house for being gay, and Akemi, an elderly Japanese woman. 


 


She took their advice and slept under a bridge underneath a motorway, keeping her mostly dry at the very least, but she was always chased away when trying to make permanent camp in warehouses. It was hardly easy. She often starved, and honestly, she was just barely surviving day to day.


 


Winters had obviously been the worst. Dhatura felt she now had a permanent chill to her bones, despite staying in the youth shelters as much as she could. 


 


But her minimal luck had yet to run out, so she was grateful for that at the very least.


 


Three years later, and not much had changed. Her little camp saw several freezing winters, but Dhatura kept in mind that she hadn't died yet and that was enough for her. And while, as wasn't quite permanently bitter, she held some resentment towards the Dursley's.


 


She slept in threadbare sleeping bags, but she had found a tiny mattress a year ago and it served as an extra cushion. 


 


Dhatura would never call it home. It helped her to survive, and kept her mostly safe, but it was hellish and dirty. She longed for a nice meal in a nice house. 


 


That day had started just like any other. The sun rose early on a summer day, and wildlife around her began stirring. Dhatura refused to move today, content to dream about a better life than she was leading today. A life with loving parents, a warm home filled with laughter, and food made with the intent to keep her safe and content. 


 


She was about to drift off to sleep again when she heard the nearby flapping of wings and a short hoot, alerting her that some bird was close. She peeked a sleepy eye open to see an open right in front of her face.


 


Spooked, she jumped and slipped out of her sleeping bag cautiously. The owl blinked up at the tiny girl innocently, and seemed to be gripping onto a piece of paper. 


 


She took a step forward.


 


The owl took a step forward. 


 


She took another step.


 


The owl took another.


 


They stared at each other down, until Dhatura slowly crouched to pick up the letter, unwilling to get any closer to this truly strange bird that acted almost human.


 


Snatching quickly, she backed away, but the owl remained blinking up at her. Fancy her, having a staring contest with an owl with too much personality.


 


Shaking her head, she looked at the letter. 


 


It read:


 



To: Miss D. Potter





The Bridge Under The Motorway





London



 


""I really don't know what this is about but it's creeping me out,"" she informed the owl in a frank tone, which irritatingly continued to blink up at her. 


 


Hesitantly, Dhatura broke the seal and opened the letter. What found was even more crazy:


 



HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY





Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE





(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)





Dear Miss Potter,





We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.





Yours sincerely,





Minerva McGonagall





Deputy Headmistress





 





HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY



 


Dhatura truly did not know what to make of this. Was this a prank from Raz? Or from some stupid group of teenagers that thought it was bloody hilarious to make fun of homeless people?


 


She didn't bother to look at the book list, as she didn't feel like dealing with that mind blowing experience. 


 


She was stunned into silence.


 


She stared at the awaiting owl and remembered that the letter had said it expected some sort of reply... She truly didn't know what to say.


 


This had to be fake... Witches and wizards? 


 


She supposed she had to answer or else the owl would probably peck her eyes out. 


 


She stepped over to her old schoolbag, and pulled out a pen she had found last week on the street outside of a fancy bank, and on the bottom corner of the first page of the letter she penned out a note.


 



Hello, is this a prank? I'm very confused.- Dhatura Lily Potter



 


She stalked back over to the owl and handed the letter off.


 


""Er- take this I s'pose?"" And the bird nabbed the letter back. Dhatura merely hoped it got back to whoever it was supposed to. 


 


***



Several months later, and it was July 31st, Dhatura's 11th birthday. She still hadn't heard from the crazy wizard school. She simply believed at this point that it was just some prank.


 


On this bright summer morning, Dhatura once again snuggled deeper into her makeshift bed and let herself have a lie-in as a small birthday present to herself. It was pretty much all she could afford anyway.


 


She felt the sun hit her from beneath her spot under the bridge and gave herself a small grin, just celebrating the fact that she was alive. She wasn't going to let this get her. She had been through worse with the Dursley's all those years ago.


 


A small but loud pop hit her ears. Opening her eyes, she found the strangest dressed woman she had ever seen, which was hard to believe, seeing as she had been living in pits of London. She felt vague deja vu and remembered this exact scenario happening the last time she had a lie in, with that bloody owl. 


 


Dhatura sat up warily and grabbed the small pocket knife for protection, upset at the disturbance of her sleep. She gazed at the woman who was stunned at the site before her. The woman was tall, emphasized by her strict posture, with greying hair pulled but into a tight bun, adorming what looked like a long dress and robe and lastly, a witch's hat straight out of the Wizard of Oz movie from decades ago. (She was homeless, not culturally unaware.)


 


""Miss... Miss Potter is that

 you

?"" The woman held a Scottish cant.


 


""I suppose yes. Who wants to know?"" Dhatura was suspicious. How could a woman simply 

appear? 



 


The woman was still taken aback, which seemed abnormal on her. ""I-I'm sorry, are you sure? Miss Potter was meant to have been living with-""


 


""The Dursleys? It didn't work out.""


 


There was a pause, whilst the woman blinked her widening eyes in pure shock.


 


All the woman said was, ""I suppose we are in for a long talk then..."" 


 


***


 


""I assume I should start with the most pressing matter outside of this situation. I am Professor Minerva McGonagall of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You, Miss Dhatura Lily Potter, are a witch.""


 



What an elegant way to begin this conversation, 

Dhatura thought to herself.


 


""Well that's an arsehole move, lady."" The disbelieving look on the woman's face was quite amusing, but the young girl believed that it was tit for tat, as she just called her a witch.


 


""Miss Potter!"" This professor had come in her, insulted her, then scolded her for her language? Lame. ""No, I meant as in, witches and wizards, and magic. You were born in a magical world, quite literally. In fact, did the Dursleys never inform you?""


 


Dhatura snorted with cynicism, but finally released the grip on her hidden knife. ""'Inform me?' They certainly didn't 'inform me' of anything, including when they abandoned me and moved out of their house, leaving me locked in the closet.""


 


If possible, the woman's eyes widened further, whilst her eyebrows grew steadily. ""I cannot believe it,"" she murmured, rage injecting into every syllable. 


 


The girl kept on. ""So no, I don't believe anyone told me of any magic."" 


 


The mysterious professor shook off her emotions, promising herself to deal with this part later. She gazed at the small girl, who was still stiffly leaning in her little cot as if to guard herself. Dhatira's dark hair was ratty and greasy, but Minerva could see evidence of her father's wild, untameable hair. Her skin, dry and scratched from the elements was naturally bronzed, also taken from her father. The child's eyes, though, were just as brilliant as her mother's, an awe inspiring emerald, yet filled with distrust for the world.


 


The girl, so young, should have been care-free, happy and innocent, but her she was, distrustful, small, and so

 skinny

. 


 


""Well, I suppose I have some convincing to do,"" Minerva stated, and gripped her wand.


 


Waving the stick, she conjured up new clothes for the girl, and offered them, almost like an olive branch. ""We have many things to discuss further, and we will, but first we must take a small trip, so you might as well clean up a bit.""


 


Glaring up questioningly, Dhatura relaxed a bit as the woman turned away for privacy. 


 


As she finished pulling the plain clothes on, including a pair of blue jeans, plain black sneakers, and a black shirt, she stuffed her pocket knife in the front pocket of the new jeans and McGonagall twirled back around.


 


""Where are we going anyway?""


 


""We are going to Diagon Alley. First and foremost, we will stop by the bank, then we shall get you some food, as you are horribly in need of a good meal, and discuss these such things further."" The professor had a stern aura around her, but seemed quite kind as she gazed down at the short girl.


 


""That sounds alright... But, miss, I don't have any money."" Dhatura was confused, she was quite obviously homeless, sleeping under a bridge. ""Obviously if I had enough money to go to school, afford meals, and all this, I wouldn't be living under a bridge like a troll.""


 


A hint of a smile winked quickly in and out of existence on McGonagall's lips. ""Yes, well, when your parents died, they left you money. I have the key with me, as Professor Dumbledore, the Headmaster, was keeping hold of it to keep it out of the Dursleys grasp.""


 


""Alright then..."" Dhatura had no idea what to say anymore. All this was happening so fast. 


 


""Give me your hand Miss Potter. We will Apparating to Diagon Alley. This will feel very odd, like being squeezed through a hole but it goes quick."" Dhatura nodded; she could handle anything.


 


Holding onto the professor's arm like instructed, Dhatura braced herself, felt the unbearable squeezing sensation, like if she was an icing bag being compressed out onto a cake. A lovely thought for a very not-lovely feeling.


 


Not even a blink later, the feeling left, and Dhatura slivered an eye open to look out at the new world around her. She had expected some magical locations, or some unicorns, anything like that, but instead they stood in front of a dank pub called 'The Leaky Cauldron.' She had passed by it a few times, but never thought much of it, as looked just like any other pub in the great city of London.


 


""No time to dawdle, let us eat and then move onto the bank. Breakfast shall be on me,"" the unbending professor proclaimed before stalking upright into the pub. 


 


Dhatura walked into a welcome sight. What she thought was going to be some normal, oddly named pub, she instead found a literally magical room. There were glasses cleaning themselves, people playing cards that exploded, and one random man stirring his coffee with a spoon whilst simply circling his finger.


 


Minerva ushered them to the seats in the middle of the floor and called over the barman with a wave. 


 


Stumping over happily, the man looked jolly as could be. ""Ah, Professor! What can I do for you today?""


 


""Yes, hello Tom, two English breakfast for me and the girl,"" she ordered patiently. 


 


""New student?"" Tom asked, only to answer his own question. ""Merlin's pants it's Dhatura Potter!""


 


McGonagall looked quite irate at the attention of the bar now focused on them.


 


""Yes, Tom quite, but we would prefer to be left alone, as we have things to discuss."" The woman was undoubtedly scary enough for Dhatura to respect her.


 


""Ah, yes sorry there Minerva, got ahead of myself, almost didn't recognize the small 'un,"" he gave her a bright smile and sod off to place the order.


 


The two sat in silence, while it wasn't uncomfortable, Dhatura had a lot of questions, even more since she had stepped foot into the pub. 


 


""Go on and ask your questions. The food will be a while anyway. You probably have a large amount so we might as well get started now, and when we go to the bookstore, load you up as to give you an understanding of this world,"" the professor said tightly, as if she desperately wished this wasn't the case. 


 


Dhatura thought for a minute about what she wanted her first question to be. 


 


""Ok, so how did that man know me? I don't believe I've ever met him, or any of the people staring at us.""


 


McGonagall looked upwards as if asking the gods to send her strength. 


 


Carefully choosing her words, the professor set out for a long story. ""Ms. Potter, to put it plainly, as a baby, when your parents were killed by a dark wizard-""


 


Dhatura interrupted her, not caring about the stern look sent her way. ""My parents were killed in a car crash. That's what the Dursleys told me. They said they were drunks and that's how I got my scar.""


 


McGonagall scowled at this. ""No they certainly were not! Magical folk are certainly stronger than that! They were killed by a dark wizard, in fact, the darkest wizard to reign in ages."" The older woman paused to gauge the young girl's reaction. 


 


""Is that how I got my scar?""


 


""Yes, as far as we know, he sent the killing spell at you, only for it to simply bounce off of you.""


 


""W-what was his name?"" She inquired hesitantly.


 


Just as hesitant, Minerva spoke softly, as to not be heard. ""His name was V-Voldemort. There is a lot of fear behind the name, so many do not speak it aloud, but I suppose you are welcome to.""


 


""So my parents died for me and I killed an evil guy with a dumb name? Better than a car crash I suppose..."" This was a lot to wrap her head around...


 


""Ms. Potter, rest assured, your parents were of the highest quality in every way possible. In fact I taught them when they were your age!"" The professor promised her. 


 


Tom brought their breakfasts to them, winking quickly as Dhatura, which gave her a small smile. No one had ever been so nice, but to have both the professor

 and 

this barman acting kindly to her, she felt it was a miracle.


 


As they ate, Dhatura processed this new information. Her parents had died, 

for her

. For so long, she had felt unloved and uncared for, but now, finding out she had had parents who loved her so much they 

died

 for her caused a deep ache inside her, longing for these parents who are praised so heavily. 


 


Finishing their food, only for the dirty plates to float away from them, the professor looked over to her future pupil.""Anything else Ms. Potter? Questions?""


 


Thinking deeply, she responded, ""I have a million questions, but I'm quite ready to meet my new world.""


 


A twitch of a smile happened upon Minerva's lips, as the woman thought 

'she ought to be a Gryffindor, just like her parents.'









          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Chapter 2 


 


Straightening herself out, the professor led Dhatura, while waving goodbye to Tom, the kind barman. Guiding her to the backdoor, the two exited the pub, only to come across a blank brick wall, with a few weeds growing out of the cracks.


 


McGonagall proceeded to bring out her wand, and tapped one of the bricks, only for the rest of them to move and form a gateway to the most amazing sight the girl had ever set eyes on. 


 


""Next time you need access from the Leaky Cauldron to the alley, just tap the third up and second across, Ms. Potter."" Dhatura nodded dumbly, too in awe of what lay before her.


 


There were people everywhere. There were shops everywhere. 


 


She saw things for potions, books, robes like the professor's, magical brooms, and so so much more. 


 


It was quite overwhelming to say the least.


 


""Well, we best be off to the bank first. While we are there I have an errand I need to do for the Headmaster, so we shall go together,"" the headstrong woman conducted. 


 


Still too taken with her surroundings, Dhatura once again nodded, which led the woman to internally smile at the girl's wondrous and curious expression.


 


They appeared before a building as white as snow, as tall as a tower, and with magnificent bronze doors. Guarding bravely, were short creatures in uniforms of scarlet and gold. Whispering down to her, McGonagall said ""Goblins."" She whispered back up the woman, ""They look like they have something shoved up their ar-"" The girl got a sharp elbow for her troubles.


 


They had clever faces, pointed beards, large scowls, and hand quite long fingers. 


 


As they approached, the goblins bowed and opened the doors to reveal a pair of silver doors, with haunting words engraved upon them spelling out:


 



Enter, stranger, but take heed





Of what awaits the sin of greed,





For those who take, but do not earn,





Must pay most dearly in their turn,





So if you seek beneath our floors





A treasure that was never yours,





Thief, you have been warned, beware





Of finding more than treasure there.



 


""Keep in mind Ms. Potter, goblins don't take well to thieves,"" she warned. But Dhatura took that as a personal challenge.


 


Entering the hall, McGonagall stalked briskly to the first free goblin available. 


 


""Good morning, we are here to take money out of Ms. Potter's vault,"" McGonagall started. 


 


""Have you got her key, ma'am?"" The goblin asked not impolitely.


 


Prepared, McGonagall brandished it and handed it over. 


 


""That seems to be in order."" And before he could continue, the professor interrupted. 


 


""I have also got a letter from Professor Dumbledore, it's about the thing in vault 713."" She seemed quite unwilling to disclose the matter in front of the young girl, or anyone else for that matter, but the goblin merely nodded. Dhatura simply minded her business for the time being, despite the exchange quirking her Nancy Drew-like curiosity.


 


""Yes, I will have someone take you both down to the vaults,"" he agreed. ""Griphook!""



A goblin, presumably Griphook, took the two through another set of doors and to a cart on a set of rails, lit only by torch light in what looked like a cave.


 


They stepped in, and the three hurtled off, as if the cart knew what it was doing without need for a guide. 


 


While her professor looked quite ruffled, and the goblin looked stoic as ever, the young Potter was whooping in her seat excitedly. It was the closest to a rollercoaster she had ever been on!


 


They stopped at a small door, pretty far down in the tunnels. Griphook got out, motioning for the girl to follow him. He unlocked the door with the key McGonagall had presented, and as the door opened, a sickly green gas bellowed out.


 


When the gas cleared, what they saw was once again another wondrous view. There was so much gold, silver, and bronze! After being told she had money set aside for her, she never imagined this much!


 


McGonagall, finally got a hold of her bearings, and swiftly conjured a large bag with the swoop of her wand, so that they could stack the coins in. ""Yes, Ms. Potter, it's all yours.""


 


Helping her put them into the bag, McGonagall explained the wizarding currency. ""The gold ones are Galleons, the silver ones are Sickles, and the bronze ones are Knuts. There are 17 Sickles in a Galleon, and 19 Knuts to a Sickle.""


 


When they were done, McGonagall climbed back into the cart, and said ""That should last you for a little while depending."" She then turned toward Griphook, ""Onward toward 713 please and thank you.""


 


They rattled onward, even passing over an underground ravine. She attempted to look over the edge, curious as the cat that got killed, only for a still flushed Minerva to pull her back. 


 


When they reached the next vault, it showed no evidence of a keyhole, but knew not to ask too many questions. Griphook simply stroked the door, and it melted away. 


 


""If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they would be sucked into the vault,"" the goblin croaked. ""Get stuck in there for 10 years before we check."" He cackled. 


 


Dhatura knew there had to be something quite eye catching for such a stealthy mission for her to behold. She took a quick peak, not being able to help her curious nature, only for it to be virtually empty except for a small brown package, which the professor pockets and climbs back into the cart. 


 


They head back the way they came on the cart, and Dhatura questioned what she witnessed. 


 


***


 


Blinking rapidly in the sunlight, she was then ushered back up the alley by McGonagall. ""Might as well get your uniform now. I have an... important owl to send to the Headmaster, but I will be back.""


 


Pushing the girl through the door, the woman then turned on a heel and marched quite aggressively towards what she assumed was an owl delivery or something similar. 


 


She hefted the heavy bag and continued fully into the shop called 

Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions

, nervous to be alone for the first time all morning in a world she hardly knew. 


 


Who she assumed Madam Malkin was a short, round woman with an extraordinarily sweet face, as if she would pinch her cheeks and hand out candies. The woman in all mauve robes smiled and said ""Hogwarts, dear?""


 


Nodding, the woman continued, ""Got a lot here, a boy just being fitted up here now!""


 


She dragged the girl to the back of the shop, where a bored looking boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a stool, while another witch pinned up his black robes. 


 


Madam Malkin stood her up on a stool next to the boy, then slipped a long black robe on her and immediately went to work, as she was quite small and skinny, so plenty of work to be done. 


 


""Hello,"" the boy said, looking around disinterested. ""Hogwarts?""


 


Dhatura gave a simple ""Yes."" She didn't like this boy so far. He seemed rude and bored which was never a good combination. 


 


""My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,"" the boy drawled with a smirk, as if proud that he got people to do things for him, the twit. ""Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing rooms. I don't see why first-years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.""


 


She officially disliked this boy. Her mind briefly took her to 3 years ago, watching Dudley bully his parents into buying him some game consol or tellie or something. 


 


So she said nothing, but the boy still continued, not picking up the signals she was giving off to not talk to her. 


 


""Have 

you 

got your own broom?"" This boy certainly was snooty. 


 


""No,"" Dhatura snipped shortly, just trying to not get stabbed by pins in peace. 


 


The rude boy still didn't take the hint. ""Play Quidditch at all?""


 


""No,"" at this point she was quite irritable. She just discovered a new world of her own, and this boy was ruining it just a bit with his uppity attitude. She hoped not everyone in this secret community was like him.


 


Though, Quidditch sounded quite interesting, especially if brooms were involved. 


 


""Well,

 I

 do - Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked up to play for my house, and I must say I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?""


 


""No."" She felt quite stupid now. Dhatura didn't know what quidditch was, or what the houses were, and felt she was going in blind. 


 


""Well no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?""


 


""Not quite,"" she responded, ""I believe any house would be lucky not to have you."" Dhatura was quite done with his attitude. 


 


Not quite hearing her, distracted by the woman who just appeared in the shop, Professor McGonagall who looked apparently satisfied by the errands she had just run. 


 


""Well look at that woman! Looks like she ate a disgusting Bertie Botts' bean...""


 


""Ironic of you to say that, as you look like a-"" She got cut off by Madam Malkins, who accidentally stabbed her with another pin. 


 


Not processing her annoyance, the obliviously terrible boy kept on. ""Wonder who she is...""


 


""Professor McGonagall at Hogwarts."" '

Play nice', 

she calmed herself. 

'Don't make enemies right off the bat.'



 


""Oh I've heard of her. Quite a stick in the mud I've heard.""


 


""She's the deputy headmistress. And I think she's quite nice. A lot nicer than you"" Yes, she definitely did not like this boy. 


 


""Oh, 

do

 you think so?"" The boy said with a practiced sneer. ""Why is she with you? Where are your parents?"" 


 


""They're dead, not that it's your business."" All Dhatura wanted was to leave.


 


""Oh, sorry I s'pose."" He did not sound sorry in the least bit. ""But of course they were 

our

 kind, yes?""


 


Raising a dark eyebrow at the boy, ""They were a witch and wizard if that's what you mean.""


 


""I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname anyway?""


 


The words 

'Fuck off'

 were on the tip of her tongue, only for Madam Malkins to once again interrupt. ""That's you done, deary."" 


 


Dhatura was thankful for having an excuse not to talk to the seemingly racist boy any longer. 


 


The boy, of course, had to get some last words in. ""Well see you at Hogwarts, I suppose.""


 


Walking out with her professor, arms laden with more bags, she was quiet. 


 


Apparently seeing the look on her face, McGonagall questioned, ""What's wrong, Ms. Potter?"" 


 


""Professor, what's Quidditch?""


 


Looking slightly aghast, she said ""Ms. Potter I forget how much you truly don't know... Quidditch is quite a large sport for us wizards.""


 


""Please don't make me feel worse. That boy in there was quite rude about everything. He said that people from non-magical families shouldn't even be allowed in-""


 


""Ms. Potter, we call them Muggles. Non-magical people are muggles. And you are not 

from 

a muggle family, not that being from a muggle family is bad. Some of the most powerful and famous wizards and witches are muggle-born,"" the professor proclaimed. ""In fact your mother was a muggle-born!""


 


Wanting to move on from the subject, Dhatura asked ""So what 

is

 Quidditch then?""


 


""It's one of our biggest sports. It's played in the air, on broomsticks, there's four balls, and three goals on each side. Perhaps we'll get you a book?"" McGonagall said as they entered the bookstore, called Flourish and Blotts. 


 


""And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"" Dhatura questioned.


 


""They are Hogwarts school houses. There is Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. I am the head of Gryffindor.""


 


Instead of asking more questions, the girl took to looking around the store for interesting books to help her learn more about everything she just found to be new. The shelves were so high they reached the ceilings. There was any form of book you could imagine; short, tall, big, small, odd shaped, and even an invisible book. She didn't understand how one could potentially read it but it was interesting enough. 


 


""Do you have your booklist Ms. Potter?""


 


Dhatura took it out and it read:


 



The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk





A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot





Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling





A Beginners' Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch





One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore





Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger





Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander





The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble




McGonagall grabbed a basket to hold all of the books and started picking out the books while Dhatura gazed at all of them, holding the basket as best she could as it got heavier and heavier. 


 


Thankfully, the professor also grabbed other books for the girl, remarking that they would help her adjust, or teach her more about their world. 


 


After paying and leaving the shop, they bought a trunk for her to carry her stuff, that the professor told her would always be somewhat light no matter the weight, and had some sort of extension charm in it to store a lot more. Dhatura truly loved magic. 


 


She pushed all of the stuff she had already gotten into the trunk, promising herself to sort it later, content to just not have to hold it all now. 


 


They went through the potions supply store, getting the cauldron and all of the potions ingredients required, not quite paying attention, knowing she was going to scour her books later for the information. 


 


""Just the wand left to get, then we shall see about getting you an animal. An owl, or perhaps a cat?"" Dhatura thought on it, she didn't particularly like owls, not after the last one she encountered. It could be useful, but who was she going to write? 


 


She also lived under a bridge. That was an entire problem of its own. She didn't want anything stolen... 


 


Dhatura told herself not to think about it for now, and not to ruin her perfectly amazing day.


 


They come up to a shop, narrow and shabby. The letters on the sign, peeling gold, read 

Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 B.C. 



 


They open the creaky wooden doors, and a faint ring called out somewhere deep in the shop. Looking around, there was pretty much nothing in the shop except for a single chair, and boxes upon boxes, stacked up to the high heavens. 


 


A blank room, yet it gave off what felt like the oldest magic possible, in the form of the dust and the silence that seemed to resound endlessly. 


 


""Ah, yes."" Dhatura jumped and grabbed her pocket knife in her jeans, not wanting it seen, but not wanting to be taken unaware. Neither woman had seen or heard the man approach. Before her, was an old man, pale in every single aspect, with wide blue eyes seeing through his two guests. ""I thought I'd be seeing you soon, Dhatura Potter.""


 


""Hello..."" The man was interesting but his eyes gave her the creeps. 


 


""You got the perfect mix of your parents it seems. You look remarkably like your mother, with her green eyes and her face, but your father's skin tone and raven hair... I remember their wands so well, hers being ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, willow, perfect for charms work. His was mahogany, eleven inches, pliable, with a little bit more force, which was perfect for transfigurations..."" 


 


He looked off into space. ""They chose their wands well... I say that, but the wand chooses the wizard, no doesn't it Minerva? Fir, dragon heartstring, nine and a half inches, quite stiff?""


 


""Yes, Mr. Ollivander, it's doing quite well,"" she said as she brandished her stick. 


 


Suddenly, Ollivander became rather close to Dhatura, and touched her scar with a long white finger. She preferred her personal space, but most wizards didn't seem to understand the concept.


 


""And I'm sorry to say I sold the man the wand that did this to you and your family... Thirteen and a half inches, yew. Powerful, but in the wrong hands... Well if I knew what that wand was destined to do..."" 


 


The professor spoke up, ""You are as much to blame as any of us, which is to say none. No one could stop him.""


 


""Hmmm..."" The man gave a thoughtful hum. ""Well now - Ms. Potter, let's get started."" The man started buzzing around her and the shop. ""Which is your wand arm?""


 


""Well, I'm right-handed if that's what you mean...""


 


""Hold out your arm, that's it."" He tapped the measuring tape, and it began to fly around her, measuring on its own. At one point it even had measured her nostrils. 


 


All this happened, and Ollivander grabbed boxes from the wall, seemingly at random without care. 


 


""You see, every Ollivander wand has a magical core, normally unicorn hair, dragon heartstring, or a phoenix feather, though I am known to experiment. Woods are also quite different, and each combination produces a different kind of want, depending on the size and pliability too, of course. Therefore, there is no Ollivander wand that is the exact same.""


 


Despite thinking him crazy, Dhatura thought this all quite fascinating. 


 


""Alright try this, unicorn hair, 14 inches, rowan, and flexible.""


 


She waved the wand, only for the chair in the corner to hit the wall violently. 


 


""Here, maple, dragonheart string, 8 and a sixteenth inch, sturdy,"" he said, only to immediately take the wand out of her hands the moment it touched her palm in the slightest. 


 


They tried at least 20 different wands until Ollivander said ""Ah-ha! Here we go, you may be a tricky customer but I have a good feeling about this one! Here, aspen, 12 and three quarter inches, phoenix feather, incredibly flexible... A wand for powerful revolutionaries, as aspen is known for that, and the feather is a signal for bravery ..."" 


 


Dhatura swished the wand upwards towards the ceiling, and it produced beautiful yellow sparks. 


 


""Bravo! Good, good,"" the man cheered. ""But curious... very curious..."" He wrapped the wand's box for her. ""You see, I remember every wand I have ever sold... And it just so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in that wand, also gave another feather for it's brother wand - the brother wand, in fact, gave you that scar.""


 


Dhatura blanched. 

'Of course nothing with me is that simple,' 

she said, unknowingly damning her school career into a complex mess of adventures.


 


""But the wand chooses the wizard of course... So must expect great things from you, Ms. Potter, as your wand being of aspen will lead you on many quests... After all, You-Know-Who did many great things... Terrible but great..."" 


 


She was officially creeped out, but handed the man the 7 galleons for her wand, then followed the professor out the door. 


I got done early bc i was excited to post this! Thank you all literally so much for the comments, kudos, hits, and bookmarks! This means so much to me, as a budding college writer!! 

(Also if anyone knows a good beta or is willing to beta, pls lmk... I have good writing skills but i also drink a lot of Dumb Bitch juice so...)

also i forgot disclaimers before, but I dont own anything you recognize... Im poor...

So before you read, just know that I personally am a fan of OC's, because, as long as they are done well, they can bring something new to a story, a side or an influence that wasn't in the original work. I value it, and that's why I've included one. #sorrynotsorry

Also, I'm not a fan of bashing, but I am a fan of redemption arcs, so you'll figure out fairly quickly the route that I'm going to take with Dumbledore.

Chapter 3


 


By the time they left Ollivander's it was time for lunch, as McGonagall took her back up through the alley and to the pub again. 


 


The two both ordered fish and chips, and the professor continuously opened her mouth to say something to the younger girl, only for words to apparently leave her. 


 


They got their orders, and a fresh pot of tea for the two of them. The teacups and saucers danced over to them on invisible currents of air, coming from the underneath of the bar where they were stored.


 


They ate quickly, wanting to get the rest of the shopping done in a swift manner. The chips, Dhatura resolved, were the best chips she'd ever had; better than any of the cheap chippies she had frequented whenever she got pocket money from strangers. 


 


They finished up, went through the backdoor and the bricks again, where McGonagall led her to an ice cream parlor, 

Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor. 

There were so many flavors, and so many she'd never heard of, like Pumpkin Juice and another named Butterbeer, and even one called Fizzing Whizbees Sherbert. 


 


Eventually, she chose what she had known to be good, no matter what world she was in; chocolate and peanut butter swirl, which she was told was called ""Hippogriff Swirl."" She had no idea what that meant, but was just as content. 


 


When they finally sat down after paying, outside watching the kids stare at a new broom that had just come out called the Nimbus 2000, Minerva finally spoke up.


 


""Ms. Potter, I have some news,"" the professor announced. ""I owled Professor Dumbledore, and he was as outraged as I was at your situation. It isn't... right, for lack of a better word. Even if you weren't the 'Girl-Who-Lived' as many call you, we cannot just let you live on the streets.""


 


Dhatura now had two little figures on her shoulders. One was telling her hopeful things like, 

'You may find an actual home now! Just imagine...' 

while the other hissed, 

'Doesn't matter does it? You were abandoned. No one will ever want you again.' 

She shook any stray thoughts away.


 


""Then what's gonna happen to me then? Magical foster homes? Yeah right..."" She licked her ice cream to hide her frown from the professor.


 


The professor twitched a smile, the longest one the girl had seen the entire day. ""No, Ms. Potter. Temporarily you are to live with me. I feel quite responsible."" She paused, as if to choose her words more carefully; she didn't want the young girl to resent her.


 


""You see, I was there with the headmaster when he left you on the doorstep after the happenings that night in which you were orphaned."" Dhatura winced. ""I saw what the Dursleys were like, I observed them the entire day, and thought they were quite crude.""


 



'That's one way to put it,'

 the girl thought. 


 


""But I allowed the headmaster to go through with his decision. Neither of us knew this was to happen, and we are very sorry. The headmaster thought it was for the best, and for reasons I do not know. But I know that the professor knew what he was doing and it was for a good reason.""


 


Dhatura thought on this, and knew it was her only option outside of remaining homeless. 


 


""I... Accept... It would be nice to have an actual place to stay, Professor McGonagall,"" the girl thought aloud. 


 


""Dear, please call me Minerva for now. Of course, at Hogwarts you are still to call me Professor, but for now we are living in the same household,"" the woman said, now giving a firm half smile. ""Do you have any... er, valuables left at your spot? We can pick them up on our way back.""


 


This all felt so unreal to her. If she played her cards right, she might never have to go back to that bridge again.


 


Knowing nothing had was valuable enough for her to go back, the girl shook her head. She already had her knife for protection, but nothing else was needed from her site.


 


Minerva nodded, not sure if she liked that answer, or utterly despised it. She called out ""Hellor!""


 


""Er, hello to you too... Minerva..."" She thought the woman was now insane. Quite a common thought today. Wizards were just odd compared to what she knew to be true.


 


The older woman raised an amused eyebrow at the girl. ""No dear, Hellor, is my house elf."" Just as she said the last syllable, a small figure popped directly in front of them. 


 


The small thing was like a bald child, with tennis ball eyes and huge bat ears, and it wore yellow flowery curtains like a toga. 


 


""Yes Mistress? What can Hellor do for you?"" The small thing squeaked.


 


""Yes, Hellor, this is Dhatura Potter, she will be staying with us for the time being, at least until September when she leaves for Hogwarts. Can you please make sure that the room directly across from mine is ready for our guest?""


 


Snapping to attention, Hellor once again squeaked, ""Yes Mistress! Anything else for the two Mistresses?""


 


An impish smile came across Minerva's face, and it suited her quite well in Dhatura's opinion. ""Yes, Hellor, please prepare a nice birthday cake for the young girl, as today is her birthday. Please pop over to Dumbledore's office and tell him he is invited over for dinner and cake if he so pleases, and to bring his great-niece as well."" The younger girl's face flushed at the attention.


 


""Absolutely Mistress! Thank yous!"" And the elf popped off.


 


Unable to make any noise except for a whine out of shock, Minerva got the girl's attention, by saying, ""Now, I believe we mentioned a pet before?""


 


***


 


Leaving the 

Magical Menagerie

, the sun was lower into the clouds, casting a burst of orange kissed light into the alley. 


 


Dhatura held onto a cage where her new kitten, a currently unnamed light ginger ragdoll cat of one month, was peacefully curled up. No one had picked the cat, as it was too tiny and was shunted from the litter, which reminded the girl of herself; tiny and abandoned, but slowly finding a new home. 


 


McGonagall joined her, picked up her trunk, filled to the top but not weighing anymore than two or three stones. 


 


""Grab my arm once more Dhatura,"" and she held out her hand. 


 


The moment she held on, she felt the squeezing sensation again, and as soon as they got onto ground again, Dhatura somehow tripped and tumbled into a heap. 


 


She took a long look around the room. It was a spacious cottage, and was well lit, decorated in soft greys and blues, with accents of red and gold things plaquing the wall.


 


Instead of commenting, the professor called out for Hellor again. 


 


""Yes Mistresses?""


 


""Hellor, take Dhatura and her luggage to her room, please. Dhatura, unpack, or sort, whatever you want to do with the room is up to you, it's yours. I will be running some errands, but I will be back quite soon. I'm simply getting basic clothes for you, just simple things, and anything that won't fit, I will resize,"" the woman ordered.


 


""Yes Mistress!"" The house elf squeaked, and popped away with the trunk, only to pop back and drag Dhatura, who was clutching her kitten's cage in shock. 


 


Holding on to her hand, the tiny creature brought her stumbling up the stairs, and careening to a room with a soft maroon door. The door opened and Dhatura was beyond happy and content. 


 


The room, painted with light yellows and blues, was the coziest place she could imagine. The bed sat in the middle of the room, a large full-sized bed. 


 


She ran up and jumped onto the beautiful, well-made bed.


 


""But Mistress Potter, I just made it...""


 


Dhatura didn't hear her. She began to cry. Never before did she have actual things of her own, to keep and enjoy. She felt overjoyed, if not a teensy bit suspicious at how everything came together.


 


She heard Hellor pop away, off to do her duties, and instead of unpacking, she decided to take a nap. Dhatura bent down, plucked her snoozing kitten up, and brought her onto the bed with her. 


 


The last thing that crossed her mind before dozing off was gratefulness at all of the things she had received today.


 


***


 


Dhatura woke up to a subdued knock at the door. 


 


""I'm up! What time is it?"" She felt a little bit crazed after waking up so suddenly from her little kip. 


 


She leapt up, disturbing her kitten, and slammed open the door, expecting to find Minerva or Hellor.


 


Instead what she found was another young girl, about 5 inches taller than her shrunken 4'1"". She had silvery blonde hair, an extraordinarily plain face with high brows. She had a kind smile, to match her opulent blue eyes. 


 


""Hello! The professors sent me to come get you! I'm Ariana Dumbledore!""


 


""Ah, uh, hi? I'm Dhatura Potter..."" This was not what Dhatura had expected.


 


""Well, obviously, silly! Come, dinner is about to be served! We're having bangers and mash! Hellor makes really good food, so dinner will be amazing!""


 


This girl was quite the ball of sunshine, and Dhatura thought it was fantastic if not a touch annoying. 


 


Ariana grabbed her arm and dragged her down the stairs the same way Hellor had.


 


They ran into the dinning room, to find an elaborate table set up with Minerva and an old man with youthful twinkling eyes. He had a beard longer than his waistband and half-moon glasses. 


 


""Hello, Ms. Potter, I am Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster to Hogwarts,"" the man started. ""It's nice to finally see you again."" 


 


""Uh, hello, sir,"" Dhatura stumbled. She realized she probably looked very rumpled from her nap, and her hair, a permanent rats nest, was even more mussed than usual. 


 


""I see you have met my great-niece, Ariana. She will be attending Hogwarts with you, entering at first-year as well."" He was quite a kind man.


 


""Yes! I am very excited to start at Hogwarts! I'm also super excited to have a friend to sit with on the train! We can go early, if grandfather will allow me to come here before going to the train, and we can find a compartment together!"" 


 


Dhatura smiled cheerfully, but hesitantly. This was her first friend. And while she was way better than that bratty kid from the robes shop, she doubted the girl would want to actually be friends with her.


 


""That sounds cool!""


 


They all chatted for a bit longer, until dinner was officially served and they ate healthily. 


 


After eating the sausage and mashed potatoes, Hellor magicked the plates away with one snap of her fingers. 


 


A well-sized cake then floated out onto the table, candles lit bright as the stars above. Dhatura could hear the crackling of the fireplace from the sitting room. 


 


As they ate the cake together, the chatter pleasantly died away to eat the delicious chocolate sweet pastry. 


 


The silence was interrupted by the headmaster's revelation. ""Hellor! I do believe we should retire to the living room, with some hot chocolate, perhaps? We brought some gifts for the birthday girl.""


 


Dhatura blushed embarrassed, as she felt like she had already gotten enough from people today. 


 


They resided to the seats in front of the fireplace, as it roared and sparked comfortingly. The fire played a dance for the group, as they talked about what Hogwarts was like, and Dhatura asked questions about the wizarding world.


 


Finally, Ariana burst. ""Uncle! Can we please give Dhatura her present now! I'm so excited to give it to her!""


 


The headmaster chuckled at his great-niece's energy for giving. ""Yes, my dear. Go grab them, please, I left them next to the front door.""


 


Ariana jumped up and ran towards the entrance, and rushed back. 


 


She handed them to Dhatura and returned to her seat, bouncing. 


 


The first package was small and wrapped quite badly. The other was the size of her head, but quite heavy in weight. 


 


She opened the smaller one, and in it was a gracefully braided bracelet with a little charm of a moon. The braid consisted of greens, blues and purples. She loved it, her first ever present given to her. 


 


""You see, I have the same one, but with a sun charm!"" She stuck her wrist out to show it to Dhatura. ""I made them myself but my Grandad was the one who bought the charms for me!"" Ariana rambled.


 


Dhatura gave a quick smile to the girl. ""It's very nice! Thank you!""


 


""Yes! Now open the next one!""


 


Ripping the paper open, Dhatura found a box that held a soft yellow baby blanket, several pictures, and a large stack of journals entitled 

'The Journal of Lily Jasmine Evans.' 



 


The baby blanket had 3 moving animals on them, a stag, a big black dog, and a wolf. It brought back memories of a little stuffed dog called ""Padfoot"" she'd had a child that Dudley shoved into his parents' document shredder, completely tearing it apart when they were 6 years old. Stitched into the blanket, in elegant cursive it read 

'To my bright Sunflower.'



 


The photos looked slightly seared at the edges like they had been in a fire a long time ago. They had pictures of a young family; a deeply tanned man with large glasses and messy dark hair and a pale redhead with twinkling green eyes moved around the paper, beaming up at her, like they knew exactly who she was. Some featured a sandy haired man with deep scars, or a handsome man with long dark locks. Every once in a while, a chubby but scared looking blonde man peeked into the frames.


 


Tears came to her eyes. Before today she knew nothing about her past, or her parents who now learned had died for her. 


 


Lastly, Dhatura took hold of the dozen or so journals of her mother's, knowing she was going to cherish them. 


 


She looked up to Professor Dumbledore, who was somber, the happy twinkle in his eyes now moved to a regretful glisten. 


 


""When Minerva owled me this morning about what had happened, I had no idea... I left you in that household for protection, but it seems I failed you, my dear. I never wanted this to happen. I should have taken Minerva's advice, but I was too busy thinking about the greater good."" Looking at Dumbledore, anyone could see his remorse clear as a midsummer's day. ""I'm sorry."" 


 


Dhatura didn't know what to say. She supposed she was too young, too unknowing of the world to fully put together what was said to her. There was still so much she didn't know.


 


""Sir, I- I accept your apology. Someday, I would like answers, but right now I just want to be content, if that's alright."" She tried to make herself sit up straight in her seat, and be more mature than her pixie-like stature allowed her to be. 


 


""Quite right, Ms. Potter. Everything in that box I scrounged up after visiting the site of your parent's cottage several years ago. Most everything had been left to ruins, unfortunately, but I was lucky to find what I did.""


 


Dhatura was awe-struck at the lengths people were willing to go to, for 

her

. ""This is the most amazing gift I have ever gotten, sir. You too, Ariana! Thank you! This has been an amazing day!"" She beamed up at every person in the room, feeling warm and welcome for the first time that she could ever remember.


 


***


 


After promising Ariana she would 'owl her', the two Dumbledores left as gracefully as they came, and Dhatura got a shower due to much prompting from Minerva.


 


Finally done for the night, Dhatura looked over her gifts one last time, her unnamed kitten curled up her again. Taking her old baby blanket from the box, she ran her hand over the stitching of the word 

'Sunflower'. 

She looked to her tiny ragdoll, who gazed at her expectantly. ""Do you like the name Sunflower?""


 


The kitten, now called Sunflower, purred lovingly. 


 


She set the blanket on her pillow and moved on to look at the pictures.


 


She gazed at her parents. Her mum looked to be very pregnant, probably with her. They were so young, probably not even 22 years of age. Her dad, just as tan as she herself was, was beaming at Lily, touching her stomach with such joy in his eyes that it brought Dhatura to tears. 


 


She realized, she missed her parents. There were holes in her heart where they belonged. 


 


She grew up on her own, in the dirty underground of London, and she wanted her parents so desperately now it pained her. 


 


Longing for the connection that she lacked for such an extended time, Dhatura looked to her mother's diaries for guidance. 


 


And she started to read.



***


 



""30 January 1971,



 



I've finally gotten my Hogwarts letter after 2 years of waiting! I've been waiting for today, because Sev told me that you get your letter on your 11th birthday, or even a bit before in some cases. 



 



It's really nice to have a friend who already knew all about this magical side of the world. I'm not going in blind, and I'm learning everyday. Sev once brought a book of household spells with him that he took from his mother, Mrs. Prince. It's all so interesting!



 



Tuney, though, still keeps warning me away from him. I feel bad, like I'm betraying her, but honestly, I'm just so curious about this world I'm about to enter!



 



Mum and dad were shocked, but they're so proud of me. I'm thankful they were never the religious sort, because they might have condemned me or something.



 



Mum told me that we would go to Diagon Alley together in June, and I'm so excited I'm counting the days...""



 


***


 


Dhatura fell asleep reading the journal, while Sunflower purred, curled up on a pillow. She felt like, while they were gone from her life, she had a piece; a tiny piece enough to give her the parental guidance she had prayed to the gods for years for. 


 


The next thing she knew was the sound of the ocean from outside her window of the cottage, the feeling of sunlight on her cheeks, and the vibrations of a quiet knocking at her door. 


 


""Dhatura? It's early but I have breakfast and we have plenty of things to do today,"" Minerva called. ""All of your clothes are in the dresser, I had Hellor put them there.""


 


She shouted an affirmation, heard Minerva walk back downstairs, and hopped up.


 


She went to the dresser in the corner of her room and saw so many clothes she had to step back in a startled manner.


 


Shakily, she picked out a striped navy and red shirt, pairing it with a random pair of light jean shorts. She didn't expect all of this, maybe a jumper and a single outfit, but definitely not a whole wardrobe.


 


The clothes shrimped her a bit, but that was fine. 


 


Walking over to the mirror, Dhatura ran a hand through her hair; long, dead, ratty but so much like her father's. Her skin, tan as her father's, but freckles dotted her face the same way they did her mother. She looked exactly like her mother, small and fairy-like, but Dhatura looked more shrimpy and skinny. 


 


And her eyes, green as the healthy leaves waving through the summer sky, the same shade of her mum's.


 


Knocking herself out of her stupor, Dhatura left her room. She raced downstairs, ready to eat and find out what her day was to be.


 


The two women ate a hearty breakfast of porridge and toast, as Minerva explained the plans.


 


""We are going to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, as I scheduled an appointment with a pediatrician to look over your health. We want you healthy and ready for Hogwarts."" Dhatura nodded. ""Then we shall eat lunch at home, and after, you can wander around here, sort anything if need be, while I make a stop to the Ministry and Gringotts to register myself as your guardian."" 


 


""Ok,"" she said simply, as there was not anything she felt objectionable. 


 


""Then, if we have time before supper, we should cut your hair, as it is most likely insufferable as it is, correct?"" Minerva inquired.


 


""W-well it's not too bad if I leave it up, but yes that would be nice,"" Dhatura claimed. 


 


Their dished popped away at the hands of Hellor. 


 


""Might as well get on with the day,"" the older woman exclaimed. 


 


They finish getting ready for the day and meet back at the front door of the cottage. 


 


""I don't have Floo powder or a Floo connection, which is another way of travelling, so we are apparating again, to the London entrance of the hospital. Grab hold again,"" Dhatura once again cringed and touched Minerva's arm. She didn't even want to question what Floo was.


 


Once again, the feeling came and went in an instant, and she opened her eyes to see an alleyway of central London. Minerva led her across the street to what seemed like an abandoned department store, made of crumbling red brick. 


 


Stopping right in front of the window, the woman grabbed hold of her hand after looking around to see if anyone was watching them, and stepped them into the window and through the looking glass.


 


""I hate magical entrances,"" Dhatura said to herself, and not for the last time. 


Thank you for all the kudos, hits, comments and bookmarks! They are all appreciated! I'm going to get around to answering comments soon, but writing is hard, and I'm babysitting a lot whilst still trying to find a stupid job for the summer. 

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Chapter 4


 


Dhatura stumbled once again., and was beginning to think it was just in her nature. 


 


Blinking her eyes open, she found herself on the floor of quite a normal hospital from what she understood they looked like in the Muggle world. Minerva walked up to the lady at a desk and spoke squarely. ""Here to see Healer Lockley for an appointment for Ms. Potter.""


 


The witch at the desk sighed loudly, like she was annoyed to be doing her job. ""Pediatrics is on floor 7, right above the 'Muggle Illness Ward'. Check in there. Good day."" The woman was quite rude and spoke in a flat voice, simply turning the page on her magazine that read ""Witch Weekly"". 


 


Minerva simply raised an eyebrow and moved on, ushering her young ward. 


 


They made it to the 7th floor, to find a male orderly sitting at the front desk. ""Appointment for Ms. Potter with Healer Lockey?"" Minerva said stiffly.


 


This man was much brighter. ""Ah yes! Ms. Potter! Nice to see you! Yes, come right back! I'm Nurse Patterson, how are you feeling today Ms. Potter?""


 


She beamed right back at him. ""I'm feeling better than I have in ages, thank you!""


 


""Amazing! Let me get you to your room then take your vitals alright? Then the doctor will be right in."" She nodded along with the man.


 


She was led to a light blue room, and the walls had moving painted fish. There was seaweed and sand and crabs and so much more. You could tell it was a room for the children's section.


 


Minerva sat on a visitor chair in the corner, while Nurse Patterson nudged her onto the bed.


 


""Now lie down, I'm going to perform some diagnostic spells and they work best when you're flat.""


 


She does as the man says and watches as he waves his wand silently over her, literally working his magic. 


 


""I was told this was your first doctor's appointment ever so I'm going to do another diagnostic test for your eyesight. Please sit up.""


 


She did as she was told and he carried on talking. ""I'm in training to be a magical optometrist, but I'm doing my rounds on the kids' floor, so it's no trouble. Now, do you have any problems seeing? Is it blurry when you read things close, or far?""


 


She thought for a moment. ""Er, yes. I have to squint to read most of the time."" He nodded, and read the diagnostic.


 


He raised an eyebrow. ""That must be an understatement, because this is telling me you're nearly blind... Tell you what, I'll go get your glasses sorted out and Healer Lockley can take care of everything else. I'll leave the diagnostic reports with her.""


 


He left and the room went silent, as Dhatura looked around wondering what the results were going to be. 


 


A knock came at the door. A short, curvy woman with dark skin entered. ""Hello there Ms. Potter! I'm Healer Patricia Lockley. I got your results here. First I must ask, Ms.-sorry, Professor McGonagall to leave the room. This information is private and for medical purposes. You are welcome to tea and biscuits in the sitting room. You will get a record of the results but the talk is private""


 


The woman stiffly nodded and left swiftly but gave Dhatura a comforting nod as she exited. 


 


""Alright, let's get started, dear!"" The woman cheered. ""Alright, so your tests show signs of severe malnutrition. I know it's probably a tough subject, but you only have to give the basics.""


 


The woman was quite comforting. ""Er- I lived with my aunt and uncle, Muggles who hated me. They didn't feed me much, nothing if I was being punished... And then they, uh, left and I lived in London under a bridge"" The woman gazed down and wrote in her notes. 


 


""Ok, we can fix that but it 

will

 take time. And there is also a bone fracture in your left arm that never healed properly. Does it give you any pain? And can you tell me how it was caused?""


 


""My arm hurts every once in a while but nothing too bad. Uh- my uncle threw me down the stairs when I was 7, because he was mad that I grew my hair back overnight..."" Dhatura mumbled this. It was all quite intrusive. 


 


""Also, before I move on, I'm required to ask this. Since you were living in several bad situations... In either situation were you ever forced to do... things with your body that didn't want to do?"" Dhatura looked highly embarrassed.


 


""No, I, uh, knew people in the circle I was in who were, but I was fortunate enough to, uh, not,"" she stuttered. The healer simply nodded and moved on.


 


""The scans also showed evidence of a lot of scar tissue, particularly on your back. If you don't mind, can you show me? You don't have to, obviously, but it would be helpful,"" the healer spoke softly as if not to scare the girl.


 


""I think that would be-be o-ok. May I please keep my training bra on?""


 


""Absolutely, dear. I will turn around and jot some notes until you tell me you're ready.""


 


Dhatura took off her red and blue shirt. She turned around so her back was facing the healer, and gave the ok to turn around.


 


She heard the healer give a light gasp. There were scars all up and down her back. Most of them were horizontal, but a few were vertical, running parallel to her spine. It looked like a cruel man's tic-tac-toe board. 


 


""Oh dear. I don't believe these will ever go away completely, but there is scar cream that will help them fade.""


 


Dhatura tilted her head down, as if ashamed. The doctor allowed her to put her shirt back on.


 


Healer Lockley must have read her mind because when she was finished, and they faced each other once again, she locked eyes with the girl. ""Scars don't make you less anything. They make you more brave, capable, and worthy of love. Don't ever feel ashamed of the battles you have fought, because even if you have lost them and been scarred, it still means you have survived and conquered.""


 


The woman looked like she knew this from experience and wasn't just talking out of her ass. Dhatura's eyes hit her lap as she pondered these words.


 


The healer nodded to her and left, prompting Minerva and the nurse from before to come back in. 


 


The bright blonde man perked up and smiled at her. ""Alright! We have your glasses! We also have to talk about the regimens you are now to be on! And here, Profesor, is your copy of the results.""


 


Minerva nodded, intent on catching every word. Her hand clenched the folder given to her.


 


""Alright, so since you are heavily malnourished, we are going to prescribe you a daily Bone-Strengthening Potion 

and

 a daily Nourishment Potion so you can catch up with other girls your age. Unfortunately, it's so deep-rooted at this point that it will help you catch up, but you will still always be a little bit below the curve. Chances are you won't grow beyond 5'1 or 5'2."" The man grinned at that. ""Reminds me of my older sister; destined to be short.""


 


He moved on, after seeing the room lighten a bit of the tension that had previously gripped the room. 


 


""Alright, and the bone potion should also help fully heal the left arm's unhealed fracture. We are also providing scar cream for the scar tissue on the back. Unfortunately it won't really work on the scar, seeing as it's a cursed scar and there's not much anyone can do.""


 


The man turned around to grab a small object he had left on the counter. ""Lastly! Here are your glasses! There weren't many frames to pick from, and I sensed you were neither a girly-girl nor a tomboy, so I picked some frames somewhat in the middle.""


 


The glasses were perfectly round, and gleaming new. The frames were black as the night. She put them on and they rested perfectly on her pert nose. 


 


Nurse Patterson conjured a hand mirror and held it up for her. She eyed herself and they were perfect! The glasses suited her face rather well.


 


""Yes I thought that you would like them. They don't block your emerald eyes either!"" The man was over the moon that she liked his pick.


 


She shined a smile at him and he returned it full force. ""Alright! I'm going to go grab your prescriptions and then you may leave!""


 


He ran off, and Minerva tucked the folder somewhere into the folds of long mauve robes.


 


Patterson came back, with a large paper bag of supplies, and saw them off, wishing them a good rest of the day.


 


***


 


It was noon when they apparated home for lunch, to see Hellor floating the food and lunch set to the table. 


 


She squeaked happily. ""Ah, Mistresses! You're home just in time! Lunch is served. You is having grilled cheeses and tomato soups! Pumpkin juice is on the table!"" And the tiny thing popped away.


 


The two women sat at the table and ate graciously, happy for the entire healing ordeal over with. 


 


They finished quickly, both famished before, but now their full bellies were content. 


 


Minerva announced to her that she would be leaving for her aforementioned errands to Gringotts and Ministry, and she was allowed free reign on the premises. If she were to have any questions, she was to summon Hellor.


 


So the professor popped off, and Dhatura called out to Hellor that was going to explore the land around the cottage. 


 


She set off, new blue rain boots stuffed onto her feet. She marched down the sloped hillside besides the cottage and landed in the sand. In front of her was a lovely beach, with a wild sea in front of it. 


 


It stretched off the coast of the small island and Dhatura was curious. She called out, ""Hellor, I have a question!"" The compact elf popped into existence on the beach. 


 


""How can I help you Mistress Potters?"" She squeaked.


 


""Where exactly... are we? Where is the cottage located?""


 


The elf perked up, ""We is in Scotland! The cottage is being on a remote island up north!""


 


The girl nodded and dismissed the elf kindly.


 


Sitting onto the gritty sand, Dhatura got herself comfortable. She let her hair down ungracefully tangling with the knotted mess as it fell upon her back.


 


She allowed herself to contemplate everything, but also let her mind wander. She knew part of who she was now, something she had been questioning for years. She had a past, she'd had parents, a home, and so much more. 


 


Dhatura's thoughts meandered to Hogwarts, which was only a month away. Anticipation gripped her tight as her heart sped behind her ribcage. 


 


She was going to learn 

magic!

 It felt better than a miracle, because for so long she had nothing, but now she was going to go to school to learn magic and she already had a friend! She had more than one dirty outfit, and school supplies, and a bracelet, and so much more than she could have ever imagined for herself. 


 


Now all she had to do was play the waiting game.


 


***


 


It was late afternoon by the time Minerva got back and she looked quite exhausted. She waved off any of Dhatura's attempts to get her to rest, as the woman was determined to sort out her hair.


 


The professor magicked up a comfortable wooden chair for the girl to sit while she tugged and ripped at her hair in the clean bathroom. 


 


Minerva got right down to work. 


 


Dhatura winced every second, imagining that the comb must already look like a small dog. 


 


The older woman soothed her, ""Halfway there. Now we just have to cut."" And suddenly a pair of scissors reached her right hand from where they sat on the bathroom counter in front of the mirror. 


 


Next, she heard the snipping of the scissors through her hair, feeling the blades touch her mid-back as they glided. She was given the ok to stand up and immediately rifled a hand through her hair, effectively mussing it up. Behind her Minerva smiled, lost in a memory of James Potter and his tendency to do the exact same thing. 


 


""M-Minerva...? Coul-Could I have bangs?"" Dhatura asked timidly, then quickly followed up. ""N-Not that I don't like my scar being shown, it is wicked but I think it might just be easier to not have people constantly staring at it. I had bangs before, but they grew out.""


 


""I'll see what I can do,"" the Hogwarts professor replied, and bent in front of the girl who was once again seated on the chair. 


 


She lengthed out the hair, and held it ready to chop. ""Ready, Dhatura?"" And she nodded.


 


This time, she saw the scissors gliding in front of her. Some tiny stray hairs tickled her nose as they floated past her face. 


 


Once again, Minerva patted her shoulder, telling her it was ok to look. 


 


She liked her new hairstyle a lot so far, constantly combing the wildness with her fingers throughout dinner, and even afterwards as she read through her mother's journal, puzzling over this mysterious 'Sev'.


 


***


 


The next several weeks went in accordance; in the mornings, she would eat breakfast and take her nutrition potions, which she learned more potions taste incredibly terrible, like rotten apples and milk. 


 


Then until lunch she would read and study from her textbooks, as well as the other books Minerva had her buy. The more she learned the more fascinated she was. 


 


They would eat lunch together, peacefully, while Dhatura talked to her guardian about what she was learning. 


 


After lunch, Dhatura would explore the cottage and the small Scottish island it rested upon. 


 


Then, just before dinner, almost like clockwork, an owl would arrive from Ariana, just as she had promised her. She would read the letter over, and respond in kind, sometimes asking questions about things she didn't quite understand from the other girl's letters.


 


Supper was also a quiet affair for the two. They ate, then went their separate ways for the night, except on Friday nights, where they would bandy around in front of the fireplace, drinking hot chocolate and told whatever stories they had, though Minerva had quite a few more.


 


On other nights after supper, Dhatura would shower, ready for bed, and read her mother's journals while cuddled up to Sunflower, dozing off into the night.


 


Life was quite serene, and it was the most comfortable she had ever been. 


 


But she continued to wait for the other shoe to drop, just in case.


 


***


 


Hellor woke her up early, as she had asked. Dhatura jumped up, shoved her glasses on and began grooming herself for the day.


 


She saw herself practically vibrating in front of the mirror, thrilled for her next adventure.


 


She combed through her hair, giving a valid attempt at taming it to no avail, then rushed around to get ready and do last minute packing.


 


It was September 1st, and she was starting Hogwarts.


 


She was already packed and sorted. And re-packed and re-sorted. Thrice.


 


She practically flew down the stairs, where Hellor had set up a large breakfast for the two residence, three, including the young Dumbledore who was set to arrive at any moment by what she was told was called a 'portkey'. She would find out soon enough what one was like, as that's how Minerva was sending them to the train station '9 and  3/4 '.


 


How were they to go to a station 

between

 9 and 10? She imagined there was a magical entrance, but Minerva told them that the portkey was to take them directly onto the train platform. 


 


At the last minute, Dhatura begged Hellor to give her a fancy braid, to which a small creature relented, holding quite a soft spot for the girl. 


 


As the elf finished her braid, and coerced the girl to her daily potions before her guest came, the household all heard a loud 

'oof' 

alerting them to Ariana's arrival.


 


Dhatura, a bundle of nerves, all but threw herself at her proclaimed best friend of a month. 


 


""Dhatura! 

Today!

 We're going 

today!

 I cannot believe it!"" The girl squealed, just as excited as her best friend. 


 


The two skipped back to the cottage, and sat for breakfast, waiting for a harried McGonagall to join them until they heard, ""You girls can eat without me! I'm running behind, I'll be down to send you off with a portkey when you're done!""


 


The two girls giggled at the idea of their new professor procrastinating like a student. 


 


They ate and chatted together, as they hadn't seen each other in person for almost a month, but owled each other every single day.


 


They had run Minerva's owl, Esme, ragged until Ariana got her own which she named Lady Marshmallow. The thing was literally a holy terror despite having such a cutesy name. It liked to dive bomb Dhatura, and had the habit of biting whoever didn't give her a treat.


 


And so Dhatura continued her streak of not getting along with owls.


 


The best friends finished up, and travelled up to Dhatura's room to chase her kitten into her travel cage. Dragging her stuff down, she called for her guardian. They were ready to leave, overly eager to get there.


 


It was 10.15 by the time Minerva came down, looking haggard. She brought with her handkerchief. She speaks a spell into it, hugs Dhatura quickly, then wishes the two good luck.


 


The next thing the two knew, it felt like two hooks had grabbed into their navels, whooshing them around wildly.


 


They tumbled to the ground in an uncomfortable heap of limbs. Magical families, used to this sort of phenomenon, stepped around them and kept moving toward the gleaming brilliant red train in front of them. 


 


The Hogwarts Express was eye-catching in a way that Dhatura didn't know any old train could be. 


 


The dusted themselves off and maneuvered their way to the train passed a large family of kind-looking red-heads. 


 


Dhatura being the bean-pole she was, could barely carry her trunk, much less lift it onto the train. Ariana, knowing this was a point of pride, tried not to laugh or patronize the girl. 


 


But that didn't stop the two twin read-heads from trying.


 


""Want a hand?"" The twin on the left asked.


 


Dhatura, prideful as ever glared at the two, but knew was going to lose the battle valiantly. ""I s'pose I will let you, seeing as you two seem to only be courteous and know that I could do it myself... Right?""


 


The two twins shared a look, exchanging humorous looks. They instantaneously began to put on a  performance.


 


""Why yes m'lady!"" ""We would never think anything else of such a brave-"" ""-capable-"" ""-knight of the highest order!""


 


She slumped, and Ariana hid a laugh.


 


Grumbling, knowing she had been beaten, she mumbled, ""Just get on with it, yeah?""


 


They grinned. ""Fred and George Weasley at your service! Let us go!"" And they grabbed both of the girls' things and ushered them in, finding the first empty compartment. 


 


She quickly brushed her bangs away for a second, already exhausted from the fall and the rush. She didn't witness it but one twin nudged the other and nodded his head at the revealed scar, but they said nothing. Araian, however, noticed the exchange and was thankful for their silence; her friend already had enough to deal with, and didn't want to see the girl pressured even more by the fame shoved onto her.


 


The identical red-heads both caressed a different hand, bowed, and left with a ""Fare-well our precious Warrior Queen!""


 


Ariana snorted quietly. ""If Hogwarts is anywhere near as entertaining as those two, our school career will be quite the comedy show.""


 


And the two waited for their journey to begin. 


Thank you everyone once again! I continue smiling everyday seeing how much people are enjoying this so far! I'm enjoying this just as much!

And just an fyi all my chapters are un-beta'd so if anyone wants, or knows how to get a beta pls lmk. I'm not too desperate but I think it's good to have one, right?

Updating twice in one night bc insomnia hit and I had nothing better to do.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Chapter 5


 


They heard the red-head family wishing each other goodbye. 


 


""Mum! We reckon we just saw Dhatura Potter!""


 


Hearing this from the train, Dhatura herself blushed and shrunk in her seat. 


 


""Oh hush, the poor girl isn't an animal in the zoo to be staring at!"" The young girl was thankful for that comment. ""Ron! Dear, you've got dirt on your nose!"" And she took out a napkin, swiping at his face. 


 


He wriggled away, disgruntled at being babied. ""Mum! Geroff!""


 


""Awwwww, does ickle Ronnikins got somfink on his nosie-wosie?"" They heard the twins coo in unison, in the same fashion they seemed to do everything.


 


The youngest boy muttered an irritable, ""Shut up gits,"" at his older brothers.


 


Their mother, sweet as she was, moved on. ""Where's Percy?"" She asked, just as another boy walked up. He was already in his black and red robes, and on them shined a gold badge with a big 

P

 on it. 


 


""Can't stay long, Mother,"" the boy, Percy, spoke bigly. ""I'm up front, the prefects have got two comparments up front-""


 


The twins entered the conversation. ""Oh, are you a 

Prefect

, Percy?"" ""You should have said-"" ""-something, we had no-"" ""-bloody idea!""


 


They faked a puzzled expression. ""Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it..."" ""Once-"" ""Or twice-"" ""A minute"" ""All summer-""


 


Tired of being the butt of the joke, the oldest boy huffed, ""Oh shut up..."" 


 


The mother rolls her eyes at their antics and turns to the twins, ""Now, do try not to get in too much trouble this year? If I get one owl telling me something like you've blown up a toilet, or- or-""


 


""We've never blown up a toilet-"" ""But thanks for the idea, Mum!""


 


""It's not funny! And do try to look after Ron...""


 


The little girl on the mother's side tugged on her sleeve. ""Mummy! Fred and George said Dhatura Potter is on the train! Can I please go see her! She must be so cool..."" 


 


Once again playing the ever stern mother, she said, ""What have I told you lot, she is just an ordinary girl! Become friends with her if you will, but don't treat her any different, you hear? She's already had enough pain for one lifetime.""


 


The family all looked at one another, then hugged and gave their final goodbyes to their sister and mother.


 


Dhatura felt even more embarrassed now but thankful for their mother's words.

 'I am just a normal kid.'



 


***


 


The train whistle blows and they hear the little sister begin to cry. 


 


One of the twins reached out and yelled, ""Don't cry, Ginny! We'll send loads of owls home!"" ""We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat!""


 


Their mother was scandalized. 

""George!"" 



 


They laughed. ""Just joking, Mum! Keep your hair on!""


 


The train moves faster and faster until the women of their family are left on the platform and their speeding towards their first year at Hogwarts. 


 


A knock came at the door, and the door slid open revealing the youngest male red-head of the family. He pointed at the empty seats, ""Are any of these seats taken? Everywhere else is full..."" The boy blushed as if sheepish that he had nowhere else. 


 


The girls who sat across from one another exchanged a look and nodded for him to sit. 


 


The boy still seemed to have the dirt on his nose, too. 


 


The compartment door slid open again. ""Hey Ron.""


 


The twins were back. 


 


""Listen, we're going down the middle of the train - Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula that he's sneaking in as a pet.""


 


Ron muttered, ""Right.""


 


""Dhatura, unknown girl-"" they barely heard the 

'it's Ariana'

 coming from the girl herself. ""Right, Ariana, we have introduced ourselves, m'ladies, but we have yet to introduce our brother, Ronald Weasley.""


 


The boy flushed once again, but the twins carried on. ""Alright well, we'll be going!"" ""Smell ya later!"" And before the door shut they could hear the other twin say, exasperated, ""Mate, I've told ya, it just doesn't work...""


 


Their voices faded down the hallway of the train.


 


Dhatura knew he was going to ask the question before he did. In fact the boy looked about ready to burst when- ""Are you really Dhatura Potter?""


 


Ariana looked a bit annoyed at the boy for his insensitivity, but Dhatura didn't mind. She was told by her new guardian that was to be expected, as she

 had

 defeated the most evil wizard of all as a baby. 


 


She simply nodded. 


 


""O-oh s-sorry I just thought it might've been one of the twins' jokes again..."" He paused. ""And have you really got the- you know...""


 


Dhatura wordlessly pushed aside her fringe, showing the boy her lightning bolt scar. ""Can't remember a thing, though, can I? Was a baby."" 


 


He looked away, still quite awkward, and felt bad about pushing too hard. 


 


So Ariana struck up conversation, always willing to make friends, even if they were a bit insensitive. 


 


""So are all your family wizards?"" Ariana inquired. 


 


Ron perked up a bit, seeing the hand he'd been given. ""Er- pretty sure yeah. My Mum said she has a 2nd cousin who's an accountant but never talks much about him.""


 


Dhatura, always yearning to know more about the culture of their world, said, ""Then you must know loads about the wizarding world!"" 


 


Ron nodded. ""Yeah, I guess. I heard you lived with muggles. What were they like?""


 


This was an innocent question, as only a single person outside of doctors and the Hogwarts staff knew about the whole 'homeless' thing, and that was Ariana. Who was coincidentally looking alarmed at Dhatura, making sure she would break or cry or anything of the sort. 


 


""Er- yeah. Muggles. Lived with 'em..."" She was obviously lying out of her teeth. ""Er- they're not all bad. Sorta like wizards; some are good, some are bad.""


 


Ariana switched the topic, very quickly, not wanting her friend to think too hard about the past. ""Yes, well I wished that I grew up with three brothers. I'm an only child too.""


 


""Five,"" the boy looked quite sad. ""I'm the sixth kid to go to school. Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, me and lastly, Ginny. I just... feel a lot of pressure to go above and beyond. Bill was Headboy, Charlie was Quidditch Captain, Percy is a Prefect, and Fred and George are just popular because they're funny.""


 


The girls shared a look. Ariana, ever the mediator, took hold of the situation. ""Listen, it may seem like you have a lot to live up to, but you can't let it be an anchor. You are you. Not your other brothers. Even if you follow in their footsteps, just learn who you are and what you're good at, because you aren't them.""


 



'Bloody deep, that was'

, Dhatura thought to herself.


 


Ron looked a little bit happier. ""Yeah, I s'pose you're right Ariana... Plus, I can beat them all at chess, even Bill! And I'm better at taking care of animals than they are. I got Percy's old rat, and he looks loads better now than when Percy had 'im.""


 


He takes out an old, sleeping fat rat. Dhatura got a weird feeling from it, not quite knowing why. 


 


""His name's Scabbers. He's not impressive or anything but he's been in the family for so long, and it could be worse. I could have a toad or something stupid like that.""


 


They all talked for a bit longer, about their home lives, Dhatura kept up the lie about living with the muggles. 


 


""Yeah, before Min- er- Professor McGonagall told me, I didn't know wizards existed or anything about Voldemort-"" Ron gasps, while the two girls looked confused.


 


""You- 

you just said You-Know-Who's name!

""


 


Dhatura raised an eyebrow. ""See, I didn't know not to say it, but it's only a name. That's what Professor McGonagall told me.""


 


Ariana nodded along, taught the same thing by her great-uncle and grandfather. 


 


By then, the train had passed through London.


 


Around half-past noon, a smiling, dimpled old woman passed with a cart. ""Anything off the cart dears?""


 


Dhatura and Ariana move to get some things, suddenly feeling their hunger. Dhatura had never seen any of this kind of candy, 'raised' in a muggle world with sweets like Mars Bars. They didn't have Mars Bars. 


 


Instead there was a colorful array of strange sweets, like Bertie's Botts Every Flavour Bean, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Liquorice Wands, and so much more than she could even name. 


 


Not knowing what she would like, she got a few of everything, as it wasn't like she didn't have money for goddess sake. She paid the witch 11 sickles and 7 bronze knuts, and hauled it all inside. 


 


Ariana came back with just a Cauldron Cake, looking quite amused at Dhatura. 


 


""Hungry are you?"" The girl inquired of her best friend. 


 


""Eh, not quite yet, but I want to try it all because I've never had any of it all. Thought we could all share.""


 


Ron's head came up quickly, done staring at the ugly lumpy package of a sandwich in his lap. ""T-thank you!"" And with the sandwich forgotten, the friendship between the three in the room officially began.


 


***


 


""What are these?"" Dhatura asked aloud, holding up a Chocolate Frog. ""It's not really a frog is it?""


 


Ariana replied first, ""No, silly.""


 


Ron carried on, ""It's charmed to move like one. But check out the card! I'm missing Agrippa.""


 


She moved to check the card at the bottom of the box, catching and munching on the animated chocolate. 


 


Ariana, now sitting next to her, looks over her shoulder. ""Oh, it's Uncle Albus!"" The Dumbledore in the card winks up at her. 


 


The boy looked a bit stricken. ""Dumbledore is your

 uncle

?""


 


The blonde grinned. ""Great-Uncle technically. He's more of a second grandfather if anything.""


 


Dhatura read the card:


 



ALBUS DUMBLEDORE





CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS





Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten-pin bowling.



 


She turned the card back around to find Dumbledore gone. ""I always forget that they never stick around in photos sometimes.""


 


Ron snorted. ""Do you expect them too? They'll be back.


 


Dhatura shrugged. ""In the muggle world, photos don't move of their own free will.""


 


""

Weird...

""


 


They move on and Dhatura quickly learned what the 'Every Flavour' meant in Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. She still was scrapping the taste of a grass flavoured bean off her tongue.


 


The countryside was flowing past them in pastures of green as they laughed together. 


 


There was a knock at the compartment door, and a tearful boy stepped in. ""Have any of you seen a toad? I keep losing him, and when I ask older students they hex me!""


 


Dhatura stood up. ""Would you like help searching?"" The boy could only nodded miserably. 


 


She nodded to her friends, ""I'll be back."" 


 


She followed the boy around the train, comforting him along the way, and asking people if they'd seen a toad. Heads swivelled toward her suspicious of who she was, but most moved on instead of pursuing it. 


 


They ended up in Neville's compartment, which he said he shared with a girl named 'Hermione', who was helping in the search. 


 


To help distract him, she introduced herself. ""I'm Dhatura Potter, by the way."" The boy didn't even blink.


 


""Yeah, I know. Our parents were friends before..."" And he trailed off. He continued on a different path. ""My mum w-was your Godmother, or that's what Gran told me.""


 


She gaped at him, silent not knowing what to say. ""Wh-what's your name then?""


 


""Neville Longbottom."" He looked plenty distracted now. 


 


She grinned, because she knew just that little bit more about her family. ""Well, it's very nice to meet you Neville! Maybe, if we get to know each other a little better, we can be brother and sister? Or god-brother and god-sister?""


 


Neville looked hopeful at that. ""T-that would be lovely. Gran would be happy that I'm making friends already... She thought I was going to be a squib..."" She nodded, despite not knowing what that meant, and filed it away to ask Ariana later. 


 


The two sat and talked, both obviously avoiding childhood and parentage, until a bushy haired girl with big teeth and pretty dark skin entered. 


 


Dhatura said stood, said goodbye to Neville after promising to catch up later, and introduced herself to the girl. 


 


""Hello, I'm Dhatura Potter.""


 


The girl grinned. ""Are you really? I'm Hermione Granger. I've read about you! Pleased to make your acquaintance!""


 


This girl seemed like a lot but that wasn't a bad thing to be, in Dhatura's eyes.


 


""Seems everyone has, yeah. I'll see you guys later, alright?"" 


 


She skipped back to her compartment with glee at finding more lost remnants of her life, only to find something she didn't quite like at the entrance to her compartment. 


 


""... looking for Dhatura Potter. I was told she was sitting in here.""


 


It was the boy from the robes shop, the one who was an utter tosser. 


 


She spoke up, just wanting to slide into her compartment and be with her friends. 


 


""Who is asking?"" She coolly shoved past them despite her tiny frame and sat in her seat. 


 


""Oh, this is Crabbe and Goyle. And 

I

 am Draco Malfoy,"" he said, as if it was supposed to impress her. Ron snorted.


 


Draco glared. ""Think my name is funny do you? Red-haired, freckled face, and more children they can afford. Must be a Weasley.""


 


At this, both Ron and Dhatura stood up, quite furious. 


 


She seethed. ""I've quite enough of you, bugger off won't you?""


 


Draco stiffened. ""Potter, soon you will see what quality wizards look like, and it definitely isn't the likes of them, a Weasley and a Dumbledore. I'll forgive you when you come crawling back."" He smirked as if he would win, but Dhatura was too stubborn to even consider talking to him again. 


 


 That was the last straw. ""Come here again, even look at us the rest of the night, and I will cut off your pretty upturned nose.""


 


While she knew there was no need for violence, it both made her feel better, and knew that a young misguided slimy git like him would take it seriously. 


 


Before anyone could make a move, Goyle, who had been reaching for a chocolate frog in the background, screeched in pain. On his finger hung Scabbers the Rat, bravely biting the boy. 


 


Goyle swung the rat off, and the three disappeared in an instant. 


 


The compartment door opened, and it was Hermione, watching the aftermath of the whole fiasco. 


 


""What has been happening here? No one better be fighting!""


 


Ron, irritated, said, ""You again? What do you need?"" Apparently Hermione had been here before looking for Neville's toad. 


 


She sniffed. ""Just come to say that you'd better put your robes on now, The driver said we're nearly there.""


 


She exited and the girls and Ron took off to get changed. 


 


Dhatura looked out the window and had no idea what was in store for her future.


 


But she knew that what was in front of her was better than what was behind, and that was the best part. 


I will try to respond to comments now! Sorry for the wait, I'm just A Piece Of Garbage Sometimes. (Also its 4 am and I'm eating cold chicken and noodles like an asshole on my couch so i have nothing better to do.)

Thank you everyone once again!

I went back and edited some of the chapters myself. They're prolly still shit, but I'm trying y'all.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Chapter 6


 


The train slowed to a stop, and just as Dhatura tried and failed to once again lift her trunk, an older student with blue robes informed her that it wasn't necessary; all belongings were magically transported to their rooms. 


 


Dhatura, Ron, and Ariana stepped off of the train together, pushed around into the throng of people, eventually encountering Neville, who whimpered that he had lost Hermione in the rush. 


 


They shoved their way through the crowd of taller students, to the gigantic man yelling, ""Firs' years, firs' years over here!"" He spotted Dhatura in the crowd, and gave her a wink with his black beetle-like eyes.


 


The man was humongous, larger than any man could possibly be, with wraggly grey, dark hair spilling off into a beard. 


 


He roared again, ""Any more firs' years? No? Alrigh' follow me! Mind yer step!""


 


The large group of first-years stumbled their way down the steep dirt slope, so dark they decided together they must be surrounded by trees. 


 


Nobody spoke much, but Neville sniffled a bit, still worried about his toad.


 


The tall man, Hagrid as he introduced himself, shouted, ""Yeh'll be gettin' yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts jus' round the bend now!""


 


There was a loud round of 'oooh's and 'ahhh's as everyone took their first glances at the castle.


 


To Dhatura it was beyond description. It was magnificent, and beautiful. The lights cast off the mountains behind it, making it twinkle brighter than the closest star.


 


They reached a lake at the end of the path, where Hagrid announced, ""No more'n four t' a boat!""


 


So Ron, Dhatura, Neville, and Ariana tiptoed into a small boat together. After everyone was in, the large man, taking up his own boat, called the boats to go forward. 


 


The sight of Hogwarts from the lake was even greater as it drew closer. The lights reflected off of the rippling water and Dhatura felt she could name a more majestic sight. 


 


They reached their destination and clambered out of the boats. 


 


""Oi! Who's toad is this!"" The scraggly man exclaimed, causing Neville to almost collapse with relief and pent up stress as he was handed Trevor. 


 


They went up the passageway and up the stone steps. Making sure he had everyone, Hagrid gave the oak doors in front of them firm three knocks.


 


The doors swung open without pause, and gave Dhatura a most welcoming sight: Professor Minerva McGonagall.


 


""Thank you Hagrid I will take them from here.""


 


The doors opened wide for the students, and what they saw was wonderful. The Entrance Hall was so big it could fit Minerva's cottage in it. The stone walls were lit bright with torches, and McGonagall led them across the hall passed a marble staircase. They passed a door to the right, where they could hear the voices of hundreds, but Professor McGonagall led them to a small chamber. 


 


She looked over the crowd of young students, as they waited anxiously. 


 


""Welcome to Hogwarts,"" her guardian finally said, ""The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room.


 


""The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.


 


""The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.""


 


McGonagall looked over Neville and Ron's haphazard appearances, with a mussed up cloak and a dirty nose.


 


Then the professor looked over to Dhatura, and gave her a soft smile, then swishing right back out of the door. 


 


Dhatura whispered to Ariana, ""How do we get sorted again? Min-McGonagall never mentioned it.""


 


Ariana shrugged, glancing over at the pale Ron. ""Dunno. Uncle would never tell me, even if I begged him.""


 


Ron jumped in. ""Fred told me it hurts...""


 


They all shivered, listening to Hermione chant everything she had learned thinking it was a test of sorts. 


 


Just when Neville was about to open his mouth to respond, around twenty ghosts floated through the walls of the chamber, alerting the first-years.


 


They seemed to be in the middle of a conversation. 


 


A fat little monk was saying, ""Forgive and forget, I say. We ought to give him a second chance-""


 


A ghost wearing a ruff and tights cut him off. ""My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name  and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?""


 


None of the first-years answered. 


 


""New students!"" the ghostly monk exclaimed. ""About to be sorted, I suppose?""


 


He got a couple of nods. 


 


""Hope to see you in Hufflepuff! My old house you know!""


 


They heard a sharp voice appear at the door. ""Move along now. The Sorting is about to start."" McGonagall had returned, and the ghosts faded back through the walls. 


 


""Now form a line and follow me.""


 


They did as they were told, as nerves ran rampant. They walked in their line across the hall, and in through a pair of double doors leading into the Great Hall.


 


The hall was a splendid place. Lit by hundreds of candles floating above them, before them were four brightly colored tables parted by the stream of upcoming students. 


 


Above the candles was a perfect moving replica of the sky above, with a pale moon and dotting stars, only blocked by the occasional wispy cloud. 


 


Hermione saw her look and whispered, ""It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read it in Hogwarts: A History!"" Not wanting to be more rude than she was, and wanting to make a good impression on a potential friend, Dhatura refrained from rolling her eyes and saying something snarky. 


 


Instead, she nodded thankfully, equally impressed by the girl's knowledge.


 


She finally looked down again, as she saw McGonagall place a ratty old witch's hat on a stool upon the platform where the teachers sat. 


 


For a few seconds, there was only silence, until the hat twitches and came to life.


 


It began to sing in a jaunty voice:


 



Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,





But don't judge on what you see,





I'll eat myself if you can find





A smarter hat than me.





You can keep your bowlers black,





Your top hats sleek and tall,





For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat





And I can cap them all.





There's nothing hidden in your head





The Sorting Hat can't see,





So try me on and I will tell you





Where you ought to be.





You might belong in Gryffindor,





Where dwell the brave at heart,





Their daring, nerve and chivalry





Set Gryffindors apart;





You might belong in Hufflepuff,





Where they are just and loyal,





Those patient Hufflepuffs are true





And unafraid of toil;





Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,





If you've a ready mind,





Where those of wit and learning,





Will always find their kind;





Or perhaps in Slytherin





You'll make your real friends,





Those cunning folk use any means





To achieve their ends.





So put me on! Don't be afraid!





And don't get in a flap!





You're in safe hands (though I have none)





For I'm a Thinking Cap!



 


The song ended, and the hall burst with applause, and she heard the Weasley Twins whistling and shouting praise. 


 


The hat went still, and Professor McGonagall rolled out an ancient scroll. 


 


""When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,"" she said. ""Abbott, Hannah!""


 


A sweet looking girl with yellow pigtails and pink cheeks skipped up to the front, and placed the hat on her head. It fell down past her eyes as she sat down.


 


It only took a moment for Hannah to be announced, ""HUFFLEPUFF!""


 


""Bones, Susan!""


 


""HUFFLEPUFF!""


 


The motion kept going on, with a ""Boot, Terry!"" being placed in Ravenclaw and so on and so forth. 


 


She heard a ""Brown, Lavender!"" get placed in Gryffindor and a ""Bulstrode, Millicent!"" get placed in Slytherin. 


 


She tuned out until she heard ""Dumbledore, Ariana!""


 


Dhatura alerted herself. Ariana humbly walked to the hat, and within less than a minute it yelled ""HUFFLEPUFF!""


 


She clapped loudly with Ron for her friend.


 


Dhatura fancied that very few Slytherins were nice looking in the sense that if possible, they would beat anyone up who crossed their crooked paths. She held up hope for at least one of them to be nice enough. 


 


She saw Hermione get placed in Gryffindor, and Ron groaned beside her. 


 


Her godbrother Neville also scuttled over to Gryffindor after being placed there. 


 


She hadn't thought about what house she'd wanted, at one point wanting to got to Hufflepuff just to spite the blonde brat. They seemed like nice, welcoming people and she thought that she'd have a lot of fun, not to mention she would be with Ariana.


 


But Gryffindor seemed nice, and Ravenclaw was alright. She rejected the idea that she would ever fit into Slytherin. They seemed like a dark and broody type, and quite honestly, she'd already had enough of that for one lifetime. 


 


She saw the Malfoy kid get placed into Slytherin and wasn't surprised. She imagined his bullying personality would fit right in with them. 


 


There weren't many people left now. ""Moon""..., ""Nott""..., ""Parkinson""..., then a pair of twin girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil""..., then ""Perks, Sally-Anne""..., and then, at last -


 


""Potter, Dhatura!""


 


She heard whispers break out across the enclave, and all eyes were on her. 

'Quite a lot of pressure,' 

the girl thought dryly. 


 


Minerva gave her an unnoticeable smile as she placed the hat over her eyes, and it did its job to calm her down a bit. 


 


She heard a small voice in her ear. ""Dhatura Lily Potter, nice to finally meet you!""


 


She felt perplexed. 


 


""Oh don't be confused, I'm just looking into your mind a bit."" Dhatura tensed. 


 


""Don't worry, everything stays nice and confidential. Just you and me. Now, let's see... You're quite a go-getter, wanting to learn more, but not driven by this... You're just curious... Conniving too, well, you have needed it out there where you were... Oh, Hufflepuff would be a good fit, but you're too mischievous. Perhaps that would be a good thing though...""


 


The hat trailed off. ""But I see a lot of bravery inside you, and the potential to do so much more with it... You would fit in well, like a glove, so better be GRYFFINDOR!""


 


The hat shouted the last word to the captive audience, and Minerva gave her a proud smile, ushering her off stage. She could hear the singing of the Weasley Twins, ""We got Potter! We got Potter!""


 


She looked over to Ariana, and they gave each other thumbs up, knowing they would still be friends because they told each other over letters that they would.


 


Dhatura sat herself beside Neville and across from Hermione, who sat next to the Patil twin who was placed in Gryffindor. 


 


She waited patiently for the other students to be placed, and a ""Thomas, Dean"" came and sat next to her after being sorted. 


 


""Weasley, Ronald!"" He placed the hat upon his ginger hair, and not a second later it yelled, ""GRYFFINDOR!""


 


The lasts sorting came and went, as ""Zabini, Blaise"", sat down at the end of the Slytherin table. 


 


Her stomach finally growled, as she gazed down at the golden plate in front of her mournfully. Dean beside her laughed at the pitious expression on her face.


 


Albus Dumbledore, eyes twinkly as always, stood and, with his normal gleeful expression said, ""Welcome! Welcome to a new year! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words! And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!""


 


Dhatura shook her head in amusement. ""What an odd man..."" 


 


The other first years around her nodded in agreement. 


 


The next thing they all knew, food appeared into existence in front of them, not unlike how Hellor could do at the McGonagall Cottage. 


 


Dhatura started to pile up foods. Mashed potatoes, roast beef, chicken, even a few foreign dishes. 


 


The ghost who wore the ruff slid across the table, speaking about how he wished he could eat food, and Ron added in, introducing him as Nearly Headless Nick. 


 


""I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -""


 


Seamus Finnegan, another boy sorted into Gryffindor that year, took a bite of chicken and asked, ""How can you be 'Nearly Headless'?""


 


The ghost looked hassled, as this seemed to happen every single year, for almost 500 years consecutively in fact. 


 


""Like this,"" he said, his irritable expression tipped with his head as it swung onto his shoulder. 


 


Dhatura chuckled and whispered over to Dean, ""I guess you could say it was a... 

hack job

...""


 


Dean, not expecting this, burst into laughter, alerting the whole table section to look at the two of them. She merely gave them all an innocent expression and went back to her meal.


 


After everyone ate as much as they could, the food faded away, and dessert popped up instead. Dhatura, still not accustomed to many sweet things, took some scoops of chocolate ice cream and was satisfied. 


 


They began to talk about families and she decided to sit this one out, just listening to the stories.


 


""I'm half-and-half,"" said Seamus. ""Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.""


 


They chortled along with him as he finished his statement. 


 


""Neville, what about you?""


 


""Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,"" said Neville, ""but the family thought I was a squib for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me - he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.""


 


Down the table a bit, she could hear Hermione bugging Percy about classes.


 


Dhatura, full to the brim, began to long for a bed to rest in, and looked up to the teacher's table. Hagrid was deep in a goblet, and Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking steadily. Next to them were a young man with a maroon turban on his head and another with long greasy hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. 


 


It happened suddenly, as she looked between the two men, a flash of pain shot across her scar. She held her head for a second, pretending to just fix her hair until the shooting pain faded.


 


Dhatura, feeling better, looked over to Percy and asked, ""Who are those two teachers next to McGonagall and Dumbledore?""


 


""Ah the one in the turban is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Quirrell, and the dark haired man is Professor Snape, the potions professor. Watch out for Snape, though, they say he knows a bit too much about the Dark Arts if you know what I mean.""


 


The desserts disappeared, and Dumbledore stood to his podium to talk to the masses of students. 


 


""Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.


 


""First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.""


 


Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.


 


""I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.


 


""Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.


 


""And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.""


 


Dhatura's eyes widened, not knowing what to make of such a grim warning towards such young students. 


 


The Headmaster moved on. ""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"" At this there seemed to be a shared grimace run through the teachers table.


 


""Everyone pick a favorite tune, and off we go!""


 


Dumbledore gave a flick of his want, and it sprouted a golden ribbon with words on it:


 



""Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,



 



Teach us something please,



 



Whether we be old and bald



 



Or young with scabby knees,



 



Our heads could do with filling



 



With some interesting stuff,



 



For now they're bare and full of air,



 



Dead flies and bits of fluff,



 



So teach us things worth knowing,



 



Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest,



 



And learn until our brains all rot.""



 


The school bellowed at different tempos, and ended at all different times, with the Weasley Twins being last singing along to a funeral march. 


 


Percy rounded all the first years into a line and corralled them up the beautiful marble staircase along with the other students of different years. Dhatura was too sleepy and her legs felt like they were being weighed down by all the food she ate to notice the moving portraits all  whispering around them. 


 


They came to a sudden halt when they saw a bundle of sticks began to float towards them.


 


""Peeves,"" Percy informed them, nudging the older prefects in front of them. ""A poltergeist.""


 


An older female prefect, Cleo Halls, raised her voice, ""Do you want me to get the Bloody Baron?""


 


There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.


 


""Oooooooh!"" he said, with an evil cackle. ""Ickle Firsties! What fun!""


 


He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.


 


""Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!"" barked Cleo, the 7th year prefect.


 


Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Percy's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.


 


""You want to watch out for Peeves,"" said Percy, as he shook off the attack. ""The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.""


 


At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.


 


""Password?"" she said.


 


""Caput Draconis,"" Cleo said. The girl was quite the leader. 


 


The portrait swung forward to reveal a round entrance in the wall. They all stepped through the portal and into a comfy red and gold common room, with a lovely fireplace and squishy chairs everywhere.


 


Percy directed the boys to their dorm, while Cleo showed them to theirs, and told them how the stairs worked to keep boys out. 


 


At the top of the staircase of the Gryffindor Tower, there were 6 four-poster beds, one for each of the girls. All of the girls changed into their pajamas, and visited the bathroom inside their dorm room. Dhatura told herself she would officially meet her roommates tomorrow when she wasn't so sleepy.


 


After they finished, they collapsed into their respective beds and into their respective dream worlds. 


Sorry I took a week to update again. I gave like 5 chapters in 4 days, but shit's been happening and I'm sick again. (It's my karma for gloating that I didn't get sick the last semester of my freshman year of college.)

I think I'm gonna aim for like a chapter a week? I dunno. It's not gonna be on a schedule, but I can guarantee that it will be often enough.

oookkkk so im very sorry. i went off and on writing this. also, college sucks, depression sucks, but you wanna know who's great? Lizzo that's all. sorry.


Chapter 7


 


Dhatura commonly woke with the rising of the sun, and the first day of classes was no different. 


 


She found she was awake before the other girls, took it as a blessing and started to get ready. She showered in hot water, brushed through her hair the best she could and got dressed. By the time she was finished, the other girls were just beginning to stir behind the curtains of their four-poster beds. . 


 


She began to sort through her things, and put the photos given to her by Dumbledore on the wall. 


 


The girls moved around her and chatter began to strike up among them. 


 


A girl named Kellah Aarons, a dark-skinned girl with a round face, asked Dhatura if she wanted to use her Lady Lock Magical Hair Brush For Textured Hair, saying that it would probably work better on her wild curls inherited by her father. 


 


Hermione, already dressed, was speed reading a textbook in her bed, with her uniform beginning to crinkle.


 


Lavender Brown and Parvarti Patil were hitting it off, showing each other their hair products and such. 


 


Fay Dunbar was a lively girl, but quiet unless talked to. Dhatura thought she could see herself getting along quite well with the fiery girl. 


 


Everyone except Hermione started to talk about upcoming classes, and uniforms, and whatever else under the sun. At one point, Dhatura consented to let Lavender and Parvarti wrangle her down in a chair and do her hair with help from Kellah. It ended up in a nicely wrapped bun at the crown of her head, with vines of hair floating down stylishly, or so Lavender explained. 


 


Hermione shut her book harshly, seemingly annoyed by the noise the girls made, and shoved it into her bag, rushing off to breakfast. Dhatura wasn't too perturbed, she understood that all of this was so new and it would take some time getting used to being around so many people just as weird as she was. 


 


After everyone else was finished getting ready, the five of them walked down to the Great Hall together, following the older students like lambs in order to find their way.


 


They found the other first-years at Gryffindor and sat down with them, eager to make friends. 


 


People around them whispered. 


 


""There, look.""


 


""Where?""


 


""Right there you numpty.""


 


""Wearing the glasses?""


 


""Did you see her face?""


 


""Did you see her scar?""


 


Dhatura supposed she had to get used to it. She was reluctantly famous here, and did not know how to handle it. 


 


After breakfast, the girls grouped together again, and followed the directions given to them by Cleo. 


 


This occurred day in and day out. Everyday the girls, who were becoming quite close as friends, would go to breakfast with the Gryffindor boys then wander to classes together. 


 


Well, all of the girls except for Hermione, who huffed to breakfast alone, then sped to class in order to get a seat at the front. 


 


Cleo told them how to not get lost, as there were a hundred and forty-two different staircases of different natures. She said, 

'when in doubt ask a portrait or a suit of armor.' 

She also said not to listen to anything Peeves said, because he would try to lead students off of the Astronomy Tower. 


 


Fred and George often gave the younger kids they liked advice like, ""Avoid Filch Like The Plague, Because He Probably Has The Plague,"" or ""Always Listen To Magical Medallions,"" but that one was probably just the twins taking the piss. 


 


Classes went fairly well. In fact, Dhatura excelled. She wasn't on Hermione's level, who was quite the bookworm, but she did fairly well in almost every class.


 


Astronomy was interesting, studying the stars at midnight every Wednesday. It was a lot more memorization that she expected, but that was perfect for her. Plotting the stars was literally magical. 


 


Charms with Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws was brilliant, but not very hard. All you needed to know was the incantation and wand movement. Dhatura would have liked to sit with Ariana, but instead she got sat with a Ravenclaw lad with a bigger head than Malfoy. 


 


Transfigurations with a mix of all four houses was difficult at first, but after some guidance from Professor McGonagall, she was one of the best in her class. She even made significant progress on turning her match into a needle, right alongside Hermione. Sadly Ariana was in the other Transfigurations class. (Dhatura learned Transfigurations, like most magic, was all about intention and being able to picture what you wanted in your mind.)


 


Herbology with the Hufflepuffs was fascinating; it was gardening but with more magic and a touch of danger. Ariana was also in her class, and they got to choose each other as partners. 


 


History of Magic with Ravenclaws would have been more interesting, learning about the culture of the world she hadn't known until the month before, but Professor Binns, a ghost, had the personality of a rock and the voice of a vacuum cleaner. 


 


They had all been looking forward to Defense Against the Dark Arts with a mix of the other houses, because it sounded dangerous and fun, but it was as boring as History of Magic. Quirrell was a joke of a man, always stuttering and evading questions about his adventures. He always smelled of garlic, and, for some reason, she always had a headache when he was around. 


 


It was the first Friday when they had their first potions lesson, in fact it was a double lesson with Slytherins. 


 


The girls once again joined the boys at the table, and they shared information about what the day was going to be like. 


 


""Snape's the potions professor. They say he always favors Slytherins because he's their head of house,"" Ron conspired. 


 


Dean humphed. ""Wish McGonagall favored us...""


 


Just then the mail arrived, and a brown tawny owl dropped a letter off for Dhatura. It vexed her a bit, because she knew it wasn't Minerva's owl, nor was it Lady Marshmallow, Ariana's psychotic beast. 


 


It dropped a note, stole a piece of her bacon out of her fingers and flew to sit on top of her head. 


 


""Bloody bird,"" she muttered. Needless to say, her luck with birds would never get any better. It nipped at her head for her rudeness. 


 


Dhatura saw Ariana smirking over at her from the Hufflepuff table and sighed to herself.


 


On the note dropped it read in the fanciful script of her guardian:


 



Miss Potter,



 



If you would like to come by next Friday, I know you have those afternoons off. Tea around 3?



 



Professor McGonagall



 



P.S. This is a Hogwarts owl. Esme is currently on business to the Ministry. 



 


Dhatura snatched a quill from her bag and scribbled her assent, saying she was looking forward to it, and shoved it to the bird on top of her head. It flew off, accidentally tugging on her hair as the talons had tangled into it. It tugged so hard, it dragged her off of the bench she had been sitting on. 


 


Dhatura clattered to the ground like a stack of cards beautifully built then blown over.


 


She hit the ground hard. She didn't get up right away.


 


Instead, she was pushed into old memories. 


 



'They were standing in the hallway. Vernon had accosted her as she exited the upstairs bathroom after cleaning it spic and span.



 



""Girl, what have you done this time! It says here you threw mud at a boy during break!""



 



In reality, the mud flew on its own, but she knew Vernon would hate her even more for that. 



 



Then, Dudley came thundering up the stairs. ""Daddy! Freak threw mud at Pier Polkis! She didn't even touch it but I know it was her! Daddy 

do 

something!""



 



Vernon was starting to turn purple. He was quite incensed this time. 



 



He grabbed her by her hair and dragged her to the top of the wooden stairs and-'



 


She was shaken out of the memory by a worried Ariana and Ron.


 


Dhatura blinked and McGonagall was upon them, towering high above the students knelt next to her, but ever worried about her, despite trying to hide it. 


 


Her friends helped her up and guided her to a bench as she shivered against them. The memories were too present.


 


""Everyone clear off. It's time for class. Ms. Potter, you may stay back,"" Ron and Ariana persisted. ""Ms. Dumbledore, Mr. Weasley, yes that means you. Run along.""


 


Everyone who had crowded her before dispersed at the sight of Minerva's glare. Ariana and Ron glanced at her, and she nodded, letting them know it was ok. 


 


Dhatura's ears rang. Her throat was sore like she had just screamed her head off. 


 


What a way to end her first week of classes at a new school where she's accidentally famous for killing someone as a baby. 


 


The shivering lessened after a few minutes, and after the food had popped off again, Minerva conjured a glass and water for her. 


 


The silence was finally broken, as only she and her guardian remained in the Great Hall. ""Ms. P- Dhatura, are you alright?""


 


""Y-yes. This isn't the first time, really, but the first time so many people have- er, witnessed this..."" She trailed off.


 


This had happened before, several times, and with different memories. Dhatura would be entranced, trapped into old memories of haunting events, and wake up just a few seconds later, knowing in her that she had screamed once again. 


 


All at once, her tears began to drown her, her breathing drew short and before she knew it, she began to quake once more. 


 


Minerva nodded to herself. ""It may not put you in his good books to skip your first Potions class, but it seems we need to visit the Hospital Wing.""


 


Dhatura, numb to reality, was guided around the castle by Minerva's hand on her back. 


 


As soon as they entered the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey ushered her in a whirlwind to a bed. The next thing she knew, she was being handed several potions, one after another. 


 


Madam Pomfrey explained the potions, but she was simply too exhausted to comprehend anything the healer said. 


 


She closed her eyes, wishing for the pounding in her head to go away.


 


***


 


She awoke to harsh whispers.


 


""... was screaming bloody murder. Has she ever told you much about her home life with the muggles?""


 


That was Ron's voice.


 


""Er- No, I don't know much. And it's not our business. Until she tells us, we are simply going to be here for her,

 right Ronald?

""


 


""Er- yeah sure. What's the muggle phrase? Be there or be square?""


 


Dhatura giggled sleepily.


 


The two immediately stopped their whispering and stood over her. ""Dhatura!""


 


""What time is it? I slept through class didn't I?""


 


Her two friends exchanged a look. Ron spoke up.""Uh, Dhatura? You slept for a whole day. It's Saturday morning. Pomfrey told us you were over-exhausted and stressed.""


 


She blinked. ""Oh.""


 


Pomfrey was alerted to her awakened patient. ""Ms. Potter! Ok, I'm just going to check you over and then you may take your daily potions and leave.""


 


Dhatura relaxed against the bed. ""Alright Madam Pomfrey.""


 


They went through the motions and she left with her friends. She was told she had missed breakfast, so she decided to just go up to her dorm real quick and grab her stash of candy alongside her school bag. 


 


They spent the weekend relaxing, joking, and finishing up work, Ron more reluctant than the other too. At one point he tried to play Exploding Snap by himself and scorched several of his fingernails. 


 


At one point, Dhatura bribed Fred and George to buy her some stuff from the prank store and candy store on their trip to Hogsmeade that weekend. 


 


Sunday was spent relaxing after their first week of classes. They lounged in the courtyard, wanting the sun but not wanting to walk all the way to the lake. It was probably going to be the last nice weekend before the rainy season of Scotland was upon them, and then indomitable winter. 


 


They laid out a blanket, and invited their friends to do the same. At one point, even Hermione, ever the recluse, hopped over and talked about how much she had missed in potions. Dhatura simply nodded along, as she was genuinely interested, but she had already read up on potions over the summer. 


 


The sun had begun to set, and they were due for dinner quite soon. It was only the three of them left; Dhatura, Ariana, and Ron watched the sun sink into the Scottish landscape. 


 


And honestly? Life had never felt so good.


 


***



Life continued in the same vague pattern. Enough to follow a weekly routine but allowing the groups of friends to get to know each other and explore the world within the castle. 


 


A week after her trip to the hospital wing, Dhatura finally attended her first double potions lesson.


 


They sat down at desks with massive cauldrons, she and Hermione left Ron with Neville in order to help Dhatura catch up with what she missed.


 


The potions lab was dark, with heavy drapery over what windows existed. Never had Dhatura seen a place that resembled the disgusting London homeless shelters so well, especially the cobwebs that no one decided to deal with and the grimy walls. 


 


Professor Snape swept in like a literal bat out of hell. 

Way to be dramatic, Professor, 

she thought to herself. 


 


Immediately, the dark professor took role, until he stopped upon her name in particular. 


 


""Ah, yes,"" he crooned, as if crafting an insult, ""Ms. Potter... Our newest... 

Celebrity

..."" 


 


He said this slowly, as if to be dramatic, but Dhatura thought he sounded obtuse, or perhaps had a stutter like Professor Quirrel, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.


 


The Slytherins all whispered together, sniggering amongst each other. 


 


He continued calling names, until all were present and accounted for. 


 


""Seeing as

 Potter

 missed the first class I shall repeat myself only once more; you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making...""


 



Wow, lovely man he is, 

Dhatura remarked to herself. 


 


""... As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly understand the beauty of the soft simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stop death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.""


 


Dhatura saw the smirk on his face, directed right at her. She knew this was some sort of challenge to be better than the rest but she had no idea why. 


 


She looked over to her fellow year mates while the silence loomed over the classroom. They all shrugged a long with her. And at that moment, she swore she was going to be the best at potions, just to prove Snape wrong, she wasn't a dunderhead, and to prove to Malfoy that she was the best witch of them all. 


 


""Potter!"" Snape barked. ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""


 


You see, Dhatura had certainly paged through her texts while lounging around Minerva's cottage but this definitely seemed out of her reach as a first year. ""I don't know sir.""


 


He quizzed her several more times on things obviously above the curriculum, all the while Hermione was stretching her arm so high Dhatura thought that she was performing some weird yoga in the middle of class. 


 


All the same, she felt herself rising to the challenge, between having the sudden need to beat Hermione and to show Snape that she was better than he wanted her to be, because it seemed like he wanted her to fail.


 


And she was gonna fucking win. 








hi guys!!! this time its only been about a month.

also before reading this chapter, go back an reread the last one, i put the tail end of it onto this chapter bc i forgot that i wanted to include the flying lesson


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Chapter 8


 


The days came and went. Dhatura met the groundskeeper, Hagrid, who had led them across the lake on their first night at Hogwarts. She had tea with him often, occasionally dragging along one of her classmates. Dean especially liked to visit with her, as he loved Fang, Hagrid's massive dog. Dean liked to say that Fang was probably twice her size. She always scowled and attempted to take a crack at her rock cake that Hagrid made. 


 


One particular visit, the topic of the recent break in to the Gringotts Bank was brought up, but Hagrid quickly shut the conversation down. Ironically, Minerva did the same thing when the topic appeared again. Dhatura knew there was something going on, but knew that she would get nothing from any teacher. 


 


As time passed, the first year student body seemed to anticipate the coming of flying lessons with the Slytherins. The thought made Dhatura nervous, she'd never even TOUCHED a broom much less ride one. She'd seen one on display in Diagon Alley but had no idea what to make of it. So she listened as Ariana soothed her and Hermione ranted facts at her about brooms, quidditch and anything else she could get her hands on. Everyone else seemed excited, or impartial, except Fay Dunbar, who seemed quite shaky whenever the subject was brought up. Ron seemed to vibrate with excitement. 


 


The day came for flying lessons, a beautiful Thursday after at 3.30. Breakfast that day was spent listening to those in their little Gryffindor group who had grown up with such things. Despite having grown up a wizard, Neville seemed overly anxious that morning, which made sense to the rest of the group, as much as they enjoyed his boyish charm, he was notoriously clumsy. 


 


The mail came as it normally did, and a pretty barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly as they looked on, curious about the package. Neville showed off a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.


 


""It's a Remembrall!"" he explained. ""Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it like this and if it turns red - oh..."" Right when he said it, the ball turned a mystifying scarlet, ""... you've forgotten something..."" 


 


Looking him up and down, Dhatura noticed that he'd forgotten to put on his tie that morning. She opened her mouth to comment, only for Draco, who was passing by, to snatch the trinket out of the boy's hands. 


 


Everyone seemed to jump to his defense, Fay looking especially fiery. Before any moves could be made, Professor McGonagall sniffed out the trouble. 


 


""What's going on?""


 


""Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor,"" Neville trembled slightly afraid of confrontation. 


 


Draco put it back on the table with a scowl. ""Just looking."" He sauntered away, Crabbe and Goyle slumping their way behind him like 11 year old henchmen. 


 


***


 


Three thirty came with the bang of the door of the Great Hall slamming open as the group of students left their last class and rushed to the grounds for their first flying lesson. Dhatura walked with Kellah Aarons who explained quidditch to her more in depth and without overwhelming her with information like Hermione typically did. 


 


As they came onto the flat lawn, they found the Slytherin students to already be there, along with around 20 broomsticks laid out on the ground in 2 lines. Dhatura knew to pick her broom carefully, as Fred and George, as well as many of the other quidditch players around, complained about the quality of the school brooms. Some apparently vibrated if you went too high, or veered slightly to the left. 


 


Their teacher, Madam Hooch, swept up quickly, with short grey hair and yellow eyes that seemed to watch their every move like a hawk. 


 


""Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on hurry up!"" Draco Malfoy sniggered, already at a stick, thinking that being barked at by a teacher is funny as if he wasn't scolded this morning by Professor McGonagall.


 


With everyone lined up at a broom, Hooch began. ""Stick out your dominant hand over your broom and say 'UP!'""


 


Everyone shouted at various times 'UP!'


 


Dhatura's broom shot right into her hand leaving her staggering backwards a bit. She was one of few. Hermione's rolled a bit, Fay's wobbled to her, and Neville's hadn't moved an inch. Dean's seemed to come to him the second time at least. 


 


Madam Hooch then showed them how to properly mount a broom without sliding off or hurting oneself.  Dhatura grinned at an unamused Hermione and a giggling Ron when Hooch sniped at Draco for doing it wrong and arguing with her about it. 


 


""Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, then come straight down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two -""


 


She never got to one, as nervous Neville, at the thought of having to fly, pushed off of the ground before the whistle was blown and began to float. 


 


""Come back boy!"" Dhatura raised a concerned eyebrow for her god-brother. He got to twenty feet, white as a sheet. Then he gasped, and slid off of the broom with a WHAM and a CRACK. 


 


Neville lay face down on the grass, shivering. The broomstick continued to fly higher and out of sight into the Forbidden Forest. 


 


Hooch helped up Neville, and muttered to herself about a broken wrist. She turned to the rest of the class. ""None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.'"" And she ushered a tear-stained Neville off and into the castle again. 


 


The second they were through the doors, Malfoy began to snigger. ""Did you see his face, the great lump?"" The other Slytherins tittered about. 


 


""Shut up Malfoy!"" Parvarti snapped. 


 


""Never knew you were into fat cry babies, Patil,"" Pansy Parkinson sneered.


 


""Look! It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."" The Remembrall glittered in his hand as he picked it up. 


 


Dhatura truly wondered if the boys here were crazy or if she were too normal. 


 


She took a step towards the arrogant boy. ""Give it here, Malfoy. Quickly and I'll think about not decking you."" She'd met bigger arses in the alleys of London. Nothing he could do could scare her. 


 


""HA. Nice try

 Potter

, come and get it!"" He mounted his school broom and began to hover. 


 


""Give it here or I'll knock you off of that broom!"" 


 


Malfoy sneered. ""Oh yeah?""


 


Somehow, Dhatura just 

knew 

what to do, no hesitation needed. She shot at Draco like an arrow, while Hermione squeaked nervously from the ground to stop what she was doing. Malfoy moved out of the way quickly, and a few people below clapped at her flying. 


 


""None of your lackeys up here to save you, 

Draco.

"" He paled a bit, coming to the same realization. 


 


""Then catch this!"" And she dove. 


 


She felt like she was moving in slow motion. Dhatura kept her eye on the ball, flying after the small trinket for Neville, and caught it just in time to pull up before crashing. To her it felt like skill, not a miracle. It was exhilarating. 


 


The energy left her as she toppled to the ground, not quite knowing how to stop and dismount a broom just yet. 


 


Then she heard one of the scariest noises she's come to known since moving in with Minerva; ""

DHATURA LILY POTTER.""



 


She stilled. She was in deep shit.


 


***


 


This wasn't the first time Minerva was mad at her. Like the time Minerva walked in on her trying to float herself to the ceiling after flipping through her charms book and wanted to fly. Or the time she

 harmlessly

 switched the sugar and the salt for the day with the help of Hellor, who grew a liking for the young girl. 


 


So naturally, she knew that hearing that yell meant trouble for her. 


 


""Ms. Potter, in all my time... could have broken your bloody neck... what would Lily think dear lord... "" Dhatura knew she was furious. 


 


""It wasn't her fault, prof-""


 


""Quiet Ms. Patil.""


 


""But, Malfoy sta-""


 


""ENOUGH, Mr. Weasley. Ms. Potter follow me"" Nice of Ron to speak on her behalf but she was already doomed. 


 


The Slytherins looked too happy with the outcome. Draco had been on a broom too, why wasn't he getting the third degree too. 


 


They were deadly silent as Minerva marched her to the castle. She was going to be expelled. Or have her magic taken away. She would have to live on the streets again. Dammit. 


 


She didn't look up while Minerva led her through the castle like a lamb to the slaughter. They stopped outside of a classroom and the professor stuck her head inside. ""Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I please borrow Wood for just a moment?"" 


 


Was Wood some sorta cane to punish idiot students?


 


Instead, out came a burly, heavily eyebrowed boy with dark hair. He looked down at her with confusion. 


 


""Follow me, both of you.""


 


They shuffled into a classroom where Peeves was scribbling rude words onto the blackboard. ""Out, Peeves!"" Minerva barked. 


 


The poltergeist nailed Wood in the forehead with the chalk and cackled, going through the wall spouting some rather

 imaginative

 curses. 


 


""Dhatura, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I found you a new seeker!"" Professor McGonagall proclaimed. 


 


The puzzlement on Wood's face smoothed out into one of joy and delight. ""A-are you for real, Professor?""


 


The woman let out the teensiest smile, ""As real as I can be, Mr Wood. She's a natural. Should have known, despite it being her first time on a broom.""


 


""Well, I tried my best, I suppose.""


 


""Now, Ms. Potter don't be shy now of all times. You caught that,"" she referenced to the Remembrall clenched tightly in her fist, ""in a fifty foot drop. There's no time to play coy or downplay anything. Charlie Weasley couldn't have even done it."" She says the last part to Wood. 


 


""Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?"" he asked excitedly.


 


""Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,"" Professor McGonagall explained.


 


""She's just the build for a Seeker, too,"" said Wood, now walking around Dhatura and staring at her 4'1 frame. ""Light - speedy - we'll have to get her a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.""


 


""I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks ...""


 


She nodded to herself. ""Wood, back to class, Dhatura, with me."" 


 


***


 


They sat for tea, and Dhatura wasn't sure if Minerva was still angry with her. 


 


""Dhatura, your father would have been so proud"" She snapped her head up to look at Minerva. 


 


""W-w-"" Dhatura could only stutter. 


 


""He played quidditch. He was a chaser though. But he would have been so happy to have seen you on that broom, Dhatura..."" Minerva looked like she was caught in the past. 


 


""Min- Professor McGonagall... Could you please tell me about them... My parents?"" With that plea, the two were caught up in story after story as Minerva regaled the young girl with the brightest, fondest images of the people she should have known. 


 


***


 


""Are you sure you wanna do this, Dhatura?"" Hermione questioned her. The three of them, including Ariana, sat at the end of the Hufflepuff table eating dinner with Ariana at her table, instead of the usual Ariana shuffling over to Gryffindor. 


 


From the Slytherin table, she could see Draco Malfoy glaring daggers at her, but seemed too afraid to confront the headstrong girl again today. 


 


Dhatura rolled her eyes. ""Yes. I'm sure. This just feels right. I'm actually pretty excited. And, y'know, whatever keeps me outta any actual trouble, right?""


 


Ariana nodded. ""Not to mention- Hogwarts youngest house player in over a hundred years. If she's as good as she was today, that's pretty significant.""


 


Hermione shook her head, and her normal massive puff of hair moved with her in a comical fashion, but neither girl commented, simply used to the gravity defying hair. As if Dhatura's hair wasn't as hard to deal with. 


 


""I start my training next week, but Wood is keeping it a secret. Apparently, I'm gonna be a secret weapon.""


 


With that said, the Weasley twins spot Dhatura at the end of the Hufflepuff table and swerve to talk to her. 


 


For once, they lowered their voices, knowing that the information they had was not meant to be boasted. ""We heard! Our little Potter is the seeker!"" 


 


""We're gonna win the Quidditch Cup for sure this year!""


 


""We haven't won since Charlie, our older brother, left Hogwarts but-""


 


""-this year the queen has come to save us from despair!""


 


Ariana and Dhatura looked at one another and giggled at the normal royalty jokes that typically sprouted from the twin jokers. 


 


""Anyway, we've got to go, your Highness. Lee thinks that we're making a breakthrough in a prank we have going on. Let-""


 


""-us know if you'd like to join in! Could-""


 


""-be fun! Smell ya later!"" Fred exclaimed. 


 


""Fred, we've talked ab-"" And the rest of their conversation faded as they trotted away. 


 


Dhatura pulled a thinking face. ""Might take them up on that... Sounds like it could be a fun time...""


 


""Honestly, Dhatura, you're too smart to do those kinds of things,"" Hermione tutted.


 


""Nah, 'Mione, it's about using your smarts to your advantage, especially when having fun. And what's a few harmless pranks here and there? Not like I'm gonna start a pranking dynasty and take the school by storm.""


 


Dinner ended quietly, and they parted ways with Ariana, heading up to the Gryffindor tower. The first years wrangled their way to take the spot by the fire. They hung around, absentmindedly doing work, playing Exploding Snaps and in general just relaxing after such a high tension day. 


 


The rest of the night passed by slowly and with Dhatura's new found motivation to study kicking in, Ron seemed to lag behind her. 








In the coming weeks, she tended to spend most of her time in study groups dedicated to one subject or another, always accompanied by Ariana and Hermione, who was a lot more pleasant than she started out being. The only problem was that Hermione was determined to show off, while Dhatura was perfectly fine knowing her own worth as a student.


 


Ron was definitely not interested in studying, much less school. He was there for the adventure, which Dhatura respected, and while she was definitely there for that too, she also wanted to go above and beyond any teacher's expectations. 


 


Time went on and Halloween approached when disaster struck and sides were taken. 


 


The 3rd week of October rolled around, and all anyone was talking about was Halloween or midterm exams. Determined to place better than the rest, she found herself barely sticking her head outside of her books. 


 


Sitting in the common room with her face stuffed into an ancient potions book labeled ""Potions Ingredience and How They Art Made"" by Millingtub Millfin. She was shaken out of a quite interesting passage about bezoars and their effects on different poisons when she felt the couch she was on shift weight.


 


""Dhatura... Mate... Ar-are we still friends? You spend all your time with other people, I know you're famous and all but... We are friends aren't we? Because Fred and George keep telling me that...""


 


She stopped him there. ""Why in the three goddess's names would you listen to your devilish brothers?""


 


He looked upset by that. ""Well at least they talk to me, unlike you. All you do is shove your face in books and giggle with Hermione and Ariana all the time. Some days you don't even acknowledge me...""


 


Dhatura snorted at that. ""Well at least I'm not studying. I came to learn, not constantly slack around with you or your brothers."" She winced at her own harshness towards Ron.


 


Ron's face turned red. ""Well at least I 

have

 brother's to slack around with.


 


Every Gryffindor in the common room froze at that, not knowing how she would react. While a short silence moved throughout every once of the space like magic, Ron's red anger faded into pale guilt and nervousness.


 


She handled it like she handled everything, with an extraordinary amount of grace. ""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?"" 


 


Dhatura never pulled punches, not while living in the streets, not while living with Minerva, and definitely not when people brought up her parents' deaths, especially when the anniversary of their deaths was a week away. In fact until then that subject had been quite ardently avoided. 


 


Hermione popped up from the chair 5 feet away and began to drag a rowdy Dhatura up the stairs towards the dormitory. The rest of the girls in the first year dorm followed, giving Ron the stink eye meanwhile, in order to make sure she was okay. The rest of the common room broke out in whispers, all peering at him.


 


Sides were taken, bets offered (mainly by Fred and George, of course), and in the mix, Ron turned up mostly alone, with only Seamus on his side, amongst a few upper year boys who told Ron that women were not to be understood. He didn't quite agree nor understand but knew better than to drive them away. 


 


He knew what he said. He regretted it as soon as he said it. He didn't know what to do.


 


And then Halloween came.

Remus was very secretive and loved to read late into the night. He was also hiding a sketch book under his mattress that everyone else pretended not to know about.

Peter had a considerable stash of sweets that he had given them limited access too (no more than three a day!). His mother kept sending him muggle games that they had a lot of fun playing until late into the evening, even if it usually took ages until they understood the rules. They were getting faster, though.

James was a lovable goofball and just about the most disorganized person Sirius had met so far. He usually left things lying around all over their dorm, so Sirius was very surprised to see him clean up his mess without any prompting on a Saturday morning.

He was even humming to himself. It was weird.

""What are you doing?"" the young Black questioned.

""I'm cleaning,"" James answered cheerfully.

""I can see that. But why?"" Peter asked, frowning.

""Because divali is starting on Friday and I'm not sure I will have time to do it later.""

Remus leaned his head to the side. ""Diwali? What's that?""

James seemed to be shocked at the questionable looks on the faces of the other three boys. ""You don't know what divali is? I get that you're not Hindu and that it's not as common here as it is in India, but you seriously haven't hears of it? Dadi would be horrified. Diwali is by far her favourite."" He shook his head.

Peter shook his head. ""Uh, no. Should we?""

""For reasons other than your grandmother's mental state?"" Sirius added.

James threw his hands into the air and moved them down his head. ""It's the festival of lights and one of the happiest events in India and I'm sure other places too. It's a festival of peace and charity. We're celebrating the victory of hope over despair, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, essentially of light over darkness.""

""Sounds interesting, but, er, what does that have to do with the cleaning?"" Sirius scratched the back of his head.

""It's part of the tradition. Which reminds me. Would you terribly mind if I were to put up some candles throughout Friday night?""

""Not particularly, since the beds all have curtains, but why?""

""On Friday it will be the new moon and the end of the months Ashvin. This marks the birthday of Lakshmi -- Goddesses of wealth and prosperity -- and Dhanvantari -- God of Health and Healing. You put on some lights if you want them to visit you and leave you gifts and blessings. You also prepare sweets and delicacies as offerings,"" James explained.

""Would you like some of my stash for that?"" Peter offered.

""Thank you for your offer, but McGonagall offers time for me and the other students that celebrate it to make the Mithai, the treats ourselves next Saturday after we're done with the rituals."" James fidgeted nervously, ""I just hope I do those correctly without Maan looking over my shoulder, it's important for a good year.""

""I'm sure you will,"" Remus reassured him."
27351166,Could Harry Potter Be Indian?,['DeutschesMaedchen'],General Audiences,Gen,Harry Potter - J. K. Rowling,,"Harry Potter, Fleamont Potter, James Potter, Lily Evans","article, Discussion, Indian Harry Potter?, Headcanon",English,2020-11-02,Completed,2020-11-02,994,1/1,22,12,null,445,"['LookOutYourWindow', 'Aspen_Gray', 'Mibami17', 'Danceurlifeaway2', 'Coffee_Punk', 'Annadi']",[],"
These days I see a theory or, rather, a headcanon, which is getting increasingly popular - that Harry Potter is of Indian heritage. There are lots of artworks and fanfictions that describe him as Indian. I tried to find the origin of this particular headcanon, but failed. The only thing I found was that people of different races and nations want to see themselves being represented in their favourite books. I have nothing against this idea, but a headcanon can only exist if it doesn't contradict the information the author gave us. So, could Harry be Indian? Today we discuss.


 


According to the Internet, most people who think Harry is indeed Indian say that he got the heritage from his father's side, saying that the Potters were an Indian family that travelled to Britain and made a settlement there, or, in some cases, that Fleamont Potter (James' father) married an Indian woman. Could that be possible? Let's start with the first variant.


 


According to Harry Potter Wiki, ,,the Potters were, for many generations, pure-blood, until the birth of Harry Potter in 1980, but they were excluded from the Sacred Twenty-Eight due to their egalitarian stance on blood purity"". So, the Potters belonged to the Sacred Twenty-Eight, along with other wizarding families like the Blacks, the Malfoys and the Gaunts, who were direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin himself. That means that the Potters, as the other families mentioned here, were British aristocracy. Also on Harry Potter Wiki, we read: ,,The wizarding family of Potters descends from the twelfth-century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe, a locally well-beloved and eccentric man, whose nickname, 'the Potterer', became corrupted in time to 'Potter'"". This means that the first Potter lived in the twelfth century, far earlier than India was colonised by Britain. What is more, the Potters are direct descendants of Ignotus Peverell, one of the Three Brothers in the tale of Beedle the Bard, and I am sure they were extremely proud of their family tree.


 


To sum up: the Potters are an aristocratic family, who are direct descendants of a famous British wizard and who were once included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight. What this means is that the Potters are British aristocracy through and through. They did not come from India.


 


Okay, but what about variant no. 2? Even if the Potters were British, Indian blood would overpower the white blood - this is simple genetics. So, what if Fleamont indeed married an Indian woman, whose heritage was passed on to James and, later, Harry? Well, I doubt it. See, James Potter was born in 1960, therefore, his father was born the latest in 1940. Harry Potter Wiki tells us he was born before 1909. Keeping those dates in mind, recall the Order of the Phoenix, where we get a taste of James' behaviour in school. I would assume his father raised him that way - he's a little spoiled, he's a bully, he's used to getting everything he wants, he's boastful - the list could go on. This reminds me a little of the way Lucius Malfoy raised Draco. Therefore, Fleamont was a true aristocrat, following the centuries-old traditions, and he expected James to be that way as well. I don't think that this, combined with the approximate dates of his life, could be characteristic of a man who would marry a woman of another race. At that time, a marriage like this would ruin the family's reputation. Moreover, it appears Fleamont was quite famous - still another reason to believe he married a British aristocrat like himself.


 


So, I think now we can all agree that, on his father's side, Harry couldn't have gotten his Indian heritage. What about his mother then? Let's tackle this as well.


 


As we all know, Indians all have black or very dark hair. No exceptions. Lily was a redhead. So, either she dyed her hair at such a young age (she wasn't even eleven when she first met Snape, and he described her as having flaming red locks), or she was simply white. However, some studies show that such strong blood (Indian, black, hispanic, asian, etc.) can wake up in a person long after the last descendant of this heritage passed away. Lily comes from a Muggle family, so we don't know anything about her ancestry... Right?


 


Wrong. We know Lily's hair is red. And what do we know about redheads? They are extremely rare. In particular, the gene that is responsible for having red hair is recessive (MC1R). This means that it has to be inherited from both parents for the child to have red hair. Petunia was a blonde, but this happens too, even if both parents have red hair - precisely because the gene is recessive. It doesn't mean that Lily's parents were both redheads, but if they weren't, they had to have had the gene in them - and even then, the chance of having a redheaded baby is just 25%. I won't go into depths here, as I am not a scientist, but in short, what this means is that Lily's family ancestors all had to have had that MC1R gene in them, therefore, they had to have been white.


 


And last but not least, remember that Harry's eyes are green. Could an Indian have green eyes? Quite unlikely - the probability of this is about zero per cent.


 


All in all, I think this headcanon contradicts the books. To have Harry be Indian we need to change at least one thing from the books, and this is just not right. We cannot go against what the author says, even if it's not clearly stated. We know that Harry's skin is a bit tanned, according to what J. K. Rowling wrote, at least. We cannot just disregard the opinion of the author, because she wrote Harry Potter and this is her world. Of course, I also like to have my own little headcanons, but they don't contradict such major things from the books.

The house was full with a delicious smell when Draco returned home that night. The stereo was pumping an addictive ballad that surely came from one of the CDs that James Potter had left to his son before passing away.



Draco took off his work robes and quickly proceeded towards the kitchen, mood already lightened just from the music and the smell of spices.



He found Harry at the stoves, a yellow apron on his front and a wooden spoon in his hand, moving his hips at rhythm with the music while putting ingredients in a pan from which big bubbles popped loudly.



It was a vision Draco hoped to come home to everyday.



""Hello?"" he tried to get Harry's attention, waving from the corner in which he'd stopped at to enjoy the view.



Harry's head raised almost instantly, and a big smile appeared on his sweating face. ""Just in time for the curry,"" he exclaimed, moving to take a plate and filling it with hot, dense orange liquid. ""How do you always do that is a mystery.""



Draco chuckled. ""I guess my instincts always tell me when you're about to go full Indian.""



Harry waved him off from his place at the stoves, and then pointed at the table for Draco to sit.



""It's just,"" Harry explained while approaching with the full plate, ""I've had an itch to cook this recipe for days. It's the summer version of my grandfather's curry, but I didn't even know it existed until I found the piece of paper inside one my mum's old books.""



Draco listened to him as he spoke with genuine interest about his family traditions: if there was one thing that Harry would never take for granted, it was what his parents had left him before dying - the possibility to have a decent life in the Wizarding World along with the discovery of his Indian roots. Harry was fully grateful to them for this.



""C'mon,"" Harry prompted him, ""taste it, let's hear what Draco Malfoy's royal palate has to say.""



Draco simply rolled his eyes, ""Promise you'll be better than any I've had before,"" he spoke to the plate, before taking a full spoon of the curry and putting it into his mouth, not caring about burning his mouth in the process. It was 

exquisite

.



He pointed his thumb up in an excited sign of appreciation.



""Yes!"" Harry shouted. ""I knew it!""



Draco smiled while sipping an entire glass of water in order to give his tongue a bit of relief. ""This time, you really exceeded yourself,"" he commented, looking at Harry's figure dancing in circles on the kitchen floor.



Harry stopped, winked at him and ""Only the best for you,"" revealed in a smirk.



Draco threw a napkin in his direction.

When a little muggleborn girl walks up to the Sorting Hat, a number of purebloods (and a number of muggleborns, to be honest) wonder why they can't see her hair- why her head and neck are covered by a dark blue headscarf.

---



Hermione Granger is faithful and studious. She hates breaking the rules and is a perfectionist. 


(She is also stupidly, irrevocably, wonderfully noble.)


In this universe, as in most others, Hermione Granger carries these traits close to her heart, in her spine and in her head. She holds faith in things that do not have a ready explanation, believes in heroes despite all evidence otherwise.



---



Hermione Granger finds a Summoning charm in her textbooks and figures it out how to perfect it before she even steps foot on the Hogwarts Express. If she is to complete her five daily prayers, then she will need a way to grab her prayer rug easily without having to carry it around all day (the Hogwarts blueprints show a school almost too large to be real- she'll have to investigate that).



She leaves her first class and her lunch block for five minutes everyday. She heads out into the hallways, summons Abba's prayer rug, recites a compass spell to orient herself toward Mecca, and recites her prayers.



---



This is not a story about heroes and villains. It is not a story about war and destruction, about magical spells and epic climaxes.



This is a story about the strength of a single girl's faith.



---



Hermione knows fear. She knows the way that people look at her hijab with suspicion, look at her father like he'll hurt them and her mother like she's stupid (despite the fact that they're both dentists, with their doctoral degrees and a wish to help others). She knows hatred, the way people sneer when they look at her and the way boys at her primary school would tug at her hijab, jeering names at her face.



She knows that Harry and Dean and Lavender and Anthony and Neville and the Patil twins all suffer from the same prejudice as she does, if for different reasons. 



When Draco Malfoy spits 

mudblood 

in her face, when he curses her origins, she calls upon the spells that she can run past her lips. She summons up a righteous anger borne of years of absorbing others' hatred, remembers pages and pages of spells. She whips hexes at prejudiced lips, smiles at the crunch of her fist against his face.



---



Hermione Janan Granger does not pray to flawed mentors and old men- she prays to Allah, and to herself. She is more than just a pawn, a fount of unfocused knowledge.



She wants to do good in the world, just like her parents, but she guards her trust close. She bestows it on those who have earned it- Harry, Ron, Ginny, Millicent, Anthony, Neville, Luna- but not on men who people seem to put blind faith in without proof. 



Her faith is strong, but it is not without base.



---



She makes friends with Anthony Goldstein, who celebrates Yom Kippur and Hanukkah and the Shabbat prayers with the same devoutness with which she practices her own faith. In a rather secular, magical world, being able to find someone else who puts such effort into their faith is relieving to her.



---



During Ramadan, her mind grows sharp and her spells powerful even as her stomach growls. Her focus increases as her hunger grows, as her faith finds its way past the limits of her stomach and into her bones.



Her dedication to her faith becomes known, and respected. During this month of the year, she is unbeatable even as her skin grows a bit sallow and her stomach grumbles during classes.



(She heads down to the kitchens after sunset and is greeted by a feast. She understands that, magically speaking, it fulfills house elves to provide food for her, but her faith does not abide by slavery of any sort. It is hard for her to process their smiles whenever she asks for food.



So, instead, she thanks each and every house elf, mentions them all by name in her prayers. Perhaps this will help them.)



---



When Hermione tells Harry, the orphan boy, the forced hero of the story, that they are all heroes, she doesn't mean that they are all saviors of worlds, leaders and princes. She doesn't mean that they have to save the day, have to be courageous and beautiful and in love.



She means that they are survivors, and that this, in itself, is a heroic act.


---




Her caftan for the Yule Ball her fifth year is modest and beautiful. A long dark blue caftan, trimmed with dark blue lace and embroidered in gold, it is just perfect. Her hijab is dark blue to match.



Viktor Krum looks at her and smiles. ""You look beautiful, sk'p.""



She smiles. ""Thank you, Viktor.""


 


Viktor Krum is nothing like the perfect Muslim boy she dreamed of as a little girl, but he 

is

 smart, and wonderful, and perfectly kind.



He respects her faith and her boundaries, calls her beautiful. He holds her hands, but does not kiss her. He is the perfect first boyfriend.


---


When she emerges from the lake, her hijab is sodden with water but thankfully still covers her hair and her neck.


---


Viktor leaves at the end of the Triwizard Tournament. Cedric won, Fleur placed second, and Viktor placed third. Despite his loss, he smiles and says, ""It vas vorth it, Hermione, because I got to meet you.""



Hermione returns his smile. ""It was nice to meet you as well, Viktor. We'll continue to write, right?""



He nods. ""Of course.""



---



Hermione Granger is not meek. She is devout, and focused on her studies, but not meek.



She is full of faith for many things: Allah, education, and herself. She channels this faith into progress, into change.


---


Harry comes to her at the end of fifth year, stomach in his throat. ""Hermione,"" he says, eyes downcast, ""I have something to tell you.""



""Yeah?"" she asks, raising her eyes from her book.


""I...I think I like boys and girls.""


She looks at him. She's suspected for a year or so, ever since his minor obsession with Cedric Diggory last year and the way he stares at Neville's arse sometimes.



""Okay,"" she says, and flips the page. ""Tell me when you finally ask Longbottom out.""



Harry sputters, and she smiles.



---



Hermione's sixth year, she breaks up with Viktor. It is an amicable split, no hard feelings between them. He wishes her luck with school and asks if she'll mind if he comes to celebrate her graduation next year.



She smiles and says 

of course not.




---



She walks into the Room of Requirement (a fascinating discovery when searching for an answer to Harry's Second Task two years ago) and finds Harry and Neville snogging in the middle of the Historic Legends section of the Great Hidden Library.



She clears her throat and they spring apart, looking like they've been caught doing something unspeakable. ""Mind handing me the copy of the 

Upanishads

, won't you?"" She gestures to Neville, who grabs a copy of the book that she's seen him reading on the 

Express 

and hands it to her. ""Thanks,"" she says, and heads over to the Muggle Sports section (the far end of the library) so she can read in peace.



---



Hermione graduates top of her class, Susan Bones, Draco Malfoy, and Terry Boot right behind her. 



The world is at her fingertips, and all of knowledge is within her grasp. She can change everything wrong with the world.



---



When Hermione Granger is eleven, she climbs a stool and puts a hat on her head. She is told that she will do well in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin, and she smiles.




I want to learn

 everything, she thinks, and the Sorting Hat shouts her House to the world.

It is the only space they can give themselves, in these days split neatly between anxiety and stolen moments of joy, all too aware of the war raging outside their door. It is all the home they can make, barely twenty-one with a child of their own that requires all of their attention. It's no wonder they find themselves clashing every so often, sleep deprived, cranky, and hurting from the loss of so many friends. It feels logical, in the moments between these great wars, between the clanging of knife sharp words thrust forth from mouths curved into angry smirks, that they should fight.

""My mother always said that if you agree with someone a hundred percent of the time, they don't really love you."" James admits, in a hoarse whisper, one afternoon. He has no idea where his parents are, hasn't received a single letter since they went back to India at his behest, shortly after he graduated from Hogwarts. He tells himself no news is good news because that's what he needs to hear. He always has. ""It's good that we're finding our limits. Our own, each other's... We need to know this stuff.""

""For what?"" Lily asks, broken glass words getting caught in her teeth. She's sure they'll come out speckled with blood, but they don't, falling harmlessly onto the too old carpet beneath her toes. She compromises, comes two steps down, the five steps between them a great, yawning chasm. Her toes grip the edge of her step, and she feels like she is standing on the edge of a cliff, nothingness in front of her, even if she does see him there, with his face turned up toward her, a sunflower seeking the light.

""We're going to be married a long time."" James says, solemn and determined. He puts one foot up on the next step, pauses as if testing the structural integrity, and then the other comes up to join it. His hand clutches the banister like a lifeline the whole time. ""Until we die. That's what you made me promise, didn't you?"" His grin emerges slowly, as if the sunlight of his smile is pushing away a thick curtain to shine through, crooked and adorable, dry, cracked lips pulling at muscles that have not been used in a long time.

For a second, Lily feels like the years between them and that final breath have been peeled back like the cover of a book, like it is eighty, or ninety, or a hundred year old James telling her not to be afraid without him. She can imagine the smile lines time will trace around his mouth, how the crinkles at the corners of his eyes will etch themselves into his skin, how she will love him even more when they are yelling at each other because it means he cares enough about their life, about her, that he wants her to see his way. She imagines Harry, all grown up, rolling his eyes at them as they get into it over how long to toast bread, lacing his fingers together the same way James does when he is pretending to listen.

""We both promised that."" Lily says. 

""Yeah."" James looks like he's drowning, something in his hazel eyes childlike in its confusion, adrift, unmoored, on a sea of doubt. She needs to touch him. 

She comes down two more steps, and he joins her there, sharing the middle ground. 

There's hardly enough room for both of them on the step, and he lays her down gently, the edges of the steps digging into her back. It would be romantic if it didn't hurt so much, but maybe that's part of the deal. She reaches out a hand toward him, smiles when James kisses the center of her palm before resting his cheek against it like a child, eyes fluttering closed in wonder and joy and a million other things, every one of them good and perfect. 

""I know we've been upset, but--""

""There's always room for being upset. In everything."" James interrupts lazily, opening only one eye and she laughs, an explosion of sound that's more snort than cute chuckle. His face is just so close to hers, and if anything, it makes what he's saying even funnier. ""Don't get all torn up about it when you were justified.""

""Fine."" Lily allows. ""If you'll be having none of that, then I've got nothing to say.""

""Oh, no apology then?"" He jokes, and she laughs again, watching mischief dance in his eyes. He's not angry, or at least, he isn't anymore. She'd known it from the way his hands had found her, always searching for something to do, something to hold. The fingers of his free hand are tapping restlessly against her waist, the other trapped beneath her body. ""So I tell you it's fine, don't worry about it, and you'll just take it as fact?""

""Oh, absolutely."" Lily jokes. ""I've got enough tact to fill a thimble and that's about it.""

""A thimble?"" James frowns. ""Don't those have holes? How can you fill one?"" He yawns. ""God, I'm tired just thinking about it. Philosophy's for people without one year olds.""

""You're assuming tact is liquid."" Lily says and James groans, batting her hand away like a kitten. ""If tact is solid and the particles are bigger than the holes in the thimble--""

""Evans, please, some of us are trying to exist painlessly here--""

""If the particles are bigger than the holes in the thimble--""

""I'll show you something that's bigger than the holes in the thimble."" James winks and Lily shoves him lightly, just enough to send a message. He rolls off her, taking a seat on the step the back of her head is laying against, and she takes advantage of the weight of him disappearing to scramble up into a seated position as well, leaning her head against his shoulder once she's settled.

""Technically, you can fill the thimble with tact. So there."" She sticks her tongue out. ""A successful analogy, no thanks to you.""

""Oh, I can also fill other things."" James says, because he's a monster, and a cheeky one at that, and Lily pinches the skin above his elbow, in the spot that always makes him howl. 

He does, predictably, throwing his head back, and she thinks of Remus, suddenly, of whether he'd crack a joke about lycanthropy if he saw James doing this. Sirius would be first to it, or he would've been, before the war -- the little she sees of Sirius now worries her. He's become someone else, someone guarded and angry and resentful, lashing out at whatever he thinks stands in his way, whether friend or foe, and calls himself right for doing it. 

Beside her, her husband complains about betrayal and hatred and pain with the same over the top dramatics she once hated, gently taking the offending hand in his own. He waits for Lily to come back to her thoughts, then kisses each knuckle one by one. 

""Back among the living, Evans?"" He asks, fingers tracing the line of her jaw before fluttering on down to her neck. He, wisely perhaps, doesn't ask where her mind's been. ""Nice to meet you. I'm your husband. You married me of your own free will.""

""Thanks."" Lily says, mouth dry. She feels like she's fumbling her words. The little flashes of joy have dissipated away, a sour aftertaste lingering in her mouth, and she wonders if happiness always comes at a price. If there is some inescapable doom lying in wait for them for daring to be in love, even when it's hard, even when it's inconvenient. 

Upstairs, their son continues to sleep. 

She takes it as a curse and a blessing.

""You're allowed to be upset."" He says, when he feels enough time has passed, and she clings to the words like he did the banister. Everyone thinks it is her that tests and hesitates and tests again, that slows life's rolling wheels to an acceptable pace, but it's him, all him, a jumble of delightful contradictions that she picks apart and solves piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle. ""Life is hard. Life is hard even without a war, and we've got one of those too."" He laughs, the sound hollow and booming, like an echo bouncing around an empty cathedral. ""Just talk to me. If I can fix it, I will. Till death do us part, right?""

""Death can try his best."" Lily spits, words dripping with vengeance and power, and James laughs, the sound almost musical. She loves his laugh, how he finds so much joy in her standing her ground. ""He'll have to go through me to get to you and that's a fight he'll regret picking.""

""It's all yours if you want it, Lil."" He smiles, eyes crinkling up at the edges, and she sees the future stretching out ahead of them, a rainbow hued bridge to something greater, something worthy of their love, at its best and worst and the collage of moments in between. ""The fight, and me, and Harry too. All of this."" His lips brush against her temple. ""We'll do what we can. All three of us. This is hard, but that doesn't mean it's not doable. Livable.""

""The same stands for you too."" She says, because she knows how he longs for his parents, oceans away (well, a sea and an ocean, if she's getting technical, but something tells her that, in this particular situation, the facts aren't any better than flowery words that stretch the truth here and there). Hers can write letters, at least, mail that Dumbledore makes her route through a chain of friends and colleagues and acquaintances so the secret of their location won't be revealed. They'd found out Dorcas had died because Lily's letter hadn't come on time, like clockwork, on the first of the month. ""If you need to talk, no matter how angry I get, or we get, I'm here for you too.""

""I know."" James takes her hand in his own. ""When we get out of here, when-- when-- when we get our own place and you become a Healer and I become-- I become-- well, whatever I become, things will be better. I guess we've just got to-- got to pretend that we're already there. Or that we're closer than we are. Optimism dies hard, I guess.""

""Well, it shouldn't."" Lily says stubbornly. ""Or you'll become like me, all old and decrepit.""

""You're two months older, Lily."" James rolls his eyes. ""See, that's the pessimism habit talking."" His breath stutters in his throat a second later, like he's afraid he's said the wrong thing, and she decides to take advantage.

""Oh, so I've got to change myself for you?"" She raises her eyebrows, tries to feign shock. ""Is that how it is, Potter?""

""As long as it's not my job, change away."" He fires back, without a care in the world, his whole body stiffening up instead of just his voice. The expression on his face is that of a child caught with both hands in the cookie jar, eyes wide and mouth set in a grim line, and she barely manages to avoid bursting into laughter. ""Oh. Um. Well, listen, Lily, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have-- It's insensitive, and--""

""Don't get all torn up about it when you were justified."" She parrots back, and he breathes out the tension in his body. She thinks she can feel it hanging between them like a cloud, charging the air with something electric. She wishes it would melt away into mist, nothing but a memory of this moment remaining. She wishes it would never come back. ""If I get to go easy on myself, you do too.""

""As long as I'm not in trouble, I'll take anything."" James smiles. As much as she loves him when they fight, she loves him more when they are done, this soft, delicate thing he becomes when the barbs have all been thrown and lie harmless on the floor, scattered about like their son's tornado of toys. ""So how long have we got before the little rascal wakes?""

""We're already living on borrowed time."" Lily says, with a cautious glance up the stairs. For all Harry's confidence, he's not as good at climbing down stairs as he thinks he is, and has an awful tendency to fall headfirst down a few steps here and there in an effort to match his parents' speed. For all his lack of balance, he's not fearful. She respects that. ""If he keeps sleeping now, he'll be up all night. I got him up in the morning, so it's your turn. Up. Go on."" 

James gets to his feet, all long limbs and creaking joints even at twenty-one, groaning as he places a hand on his lower back, bracing himself with his other hand on the banister before leaning back to crack his spine. ""That's it. Right there. God, that's good.""

""You disgust me."" Lily gags. ""Go, go, go."" She pulls herself up to her feet, reaches back to slap James' butt and ends up leaning too far back and falling on the landing. He giggles, from a few steps above her, teeth shining white in the evening light, and she falls in love again from this new vantage point, this new perspective. The day's last gasping breaths of sunlight paint his copper skin in a masterpiece of light and shadow, a work of art looking back over his shoulder at her, cocking his head to the right just so when she stares for too long.

""What's wrong, Evans?"" He teases. ""Captivated by my beauty?""

""Yeah."" She says, swallowing hard, and it takes him by surprise just like she'd anticipated, knocks the breath out of his lungs. She likes to win. ""Just a little.""

She gets back to her feet when he disappears down the hall to their son's room, climbs the few stairs left before her one at a time, each step measured and slow. She hears the door to the nursery creak open, hears her husband's voice swell around words in a language she doesn't know. She hears the quiet whisper of his hands against the sheets as he slides a hand underneath their son's body, lifting him up and out of the crib, the soft little whimpers Harry lets out as he's taken from his warm bed, before he realizes he's in his father's arms. 

She's in the doorway when her son opens sleep heavy eyes and notices her, his green eyes identical to hers under a cloud of messy black hair that could've only come from James. 

""Say hi to Mummy, Harry."" James waves Harry's hand at her and she must be smiling, because Harry lets out a delighted shriek that could practically rattle the windows. ""Tell Mummy you love her, Harry.""

""Mummy!"" He repeats happily. ""Mummy, Mummy!""

""There we go."" James bounces Harry in his arms. ""Shall we go downstairs, my liege? Or do you want to stay up here?""

Harry pats his own stomach, making a beleaguered face. ""Mumma."" 

Lily knows little of her husband's language, but enough to know that's the word babies are taught for food. She finds it a marvel of the universe that even in the midst of a war that could so easily take their lives, their toddler son is learning two languages and managing them both just fine, though he does often say things to her that she doesn't fully understand. 

Even in the cavernous darkness of war, children persevere. Children prevail. And their son, obviously, is the best of the best. Little more than a child herself, Lily is thankful for her son, for her husband, but most of all, for herself.

""A hungry boy."" James deadpans. ""All right, little prince, we can do something about that."" Father and son grin, identically, their noses scrunching up the same way as their mouths tilt in opposite directions. ""Ask Mum nicely if she'll come downstairs with us. Tell her I'll clean up your mess.""

""Down?"" Harry asks hopefully, pure, uncontainable glee in his smile, in the soft kicking of his feet, at the thought of going downstairs. ""Down, Mummy?""

""Let's go."" She says, and takes the hand that isn't at Harry's back when James comes through the doorway, and they come marching down the stairs toward their future in a tangle of limbs like Christopher Robin and Edward Bear, a picture out of a fairytale."

Bhamani...Satyabhamani...


Thinking of the energetic tempo of the music made a grin creep its way onto her face. Harini's moment in the spotlight was here. Of course, it had come many times before, but this time was special. This time, the song meant something else to her. The ebbing and flowing eddies of magic around her at every moment of the day were burning brighter in her presence. She shook out her hands and turned to look at herself in the mirror.

The eyeliner would've looked somewhat ridiculous in any other scenario, but right now, her eyes were expressive and nearly catlike. The heavy gold chain, the heavy earrings, the band cinching her waist, they were brilliant over the deep crimson fabric. Her hands were stained red with mehendi, and she tried to shrug off her excitement at the fact that the colour was deep and rich. Her braid was so long, and so heavy, with the flowers and gold hairpieces pinned generously in it. Padma's voice in the background alerted her to the fact that it was time for her to go on. She grinned wider. She had loved the spotlight, loved the performances since she was a little girl. Now, she would share that joy to others.

Her magic hummed, pleased. It was thrumming with positive energy, she felt like she could soar among the birds if she wanted to, but also as if she was walking on pins and needles.



Vayyari, muddula! Vayyari...Satyabhamani...Satyabhamani...


Krishna and his wife, what a story to tell. What a story for a lovesick girl to tell. Her teacher had been half-teasing and half-apologetic, she'd said that it was probably impossible for her to do the dance with the fullness of emotion, since she'd never been in love before. To everyone's surprise but her own, she performed beautifully. The depth of the emotion, 'a man and his wife', something she'd never been expected to do well, she'd potrayed as powerfully as she could've.

Bhamakalapam was the perfect piece for peacocking-after all, who didn't love saying that among 16,000 wives, they were the favourite-but even more so, it was one of the best ways to convey the multitude of indescribable emotions one feels when the person who holds their heart holds the hearts of others, and you can only hope that they treasure their possession of your love above all others. Every bit of that complex emotion, crashing and cresting in her like a storm, it shook the room when it radiated outwards full force. Threads of her magic searched the environment around her for even a whisper of wind that aligned with her patron, swirling around her like a foggy cloud of ribbon, cloaking her in a cocoon of a shimmering gold mist. Her arms, her legs, her back, all sore from the enormous physical effort of dancing like this for this long. She couldn't bring herself to care. 

No other euphoria felt like that. Nothing could capture the image of her feelings like that. As the beat pounded in her ears, as the band members sang and strummed and beat the tempo for her, the scene played out in her head. Fiercely possessive and beautiful, Satyabhama's song was a love letter to those who were willing to fight for their love. The crowd's low exclamations could be heard as the mist shifted, turning into the likenesses of the characters of that myth, all caught up in each other.

A cheer went up as she swayed off the stage, her heart raced, and she could barely hear her friends' congratulations over the sound of her pulse pounding in her ears. As she excused herself, dizzy from the rush of power, she reached out for the one person whose magic she'd longed to feel all night. 

As soon as Neville's magic touched hers, the dam keeping the magic from flooding out from her broke. It went whirling around the entire amphitheatre, bringing dead plants to life, putting colour into people's cheeks, rushing and giggling like a gale. She pulled his magic tightly against herself, wrapping it around her own rippling magical energy. The lehenga she'd been waiting to wear for so long was finally slipped on, and now it was simply a matter of finding him.

Harini's dupatta fluttered behind her as she ran, her eyes bright and her mind caught up in the emotion of the song. The thudding of her feet against the stone floors brought her closer and closer to him with each step, and she was frenzied in her search, clinging to his magic like a guiding star. Her bangles clanged and belled together, and for a moment all she could do was look at him. The chain round her neck had a tiger pendant dangling from it, and it shook softly in the hollow of her throat from the speed of her pulse.The tsunami of magic inside of her screamed to do something, anything. 

She felt her feet walking her to him.


His smile is so gentle.


She felt his magic tangle itself in hers.


He's never going to leave me.


Her hands reached out for him.


He didn't need to ask for my hand in bonding. 


She stood on her tiptoes.


He knew he already had it.


She hooked her arms behind his neck.


I trust him.


She gave him her maiden's kiss."

Thirty-five is old, for a wizard. Older still for an Indian wizard. Beyond inexcusable for an Indian wizard whose siblings' children are all within sniffing distance of double digits. It is not for lack of trying. 

It is certainly not for lack of trying. 

Your wife always looks tired these days and you've told her, in no uncertain terms, that this is the last go around. If this doesn't take, if there isn't a bouncing baby in her arms in nine months' time, you're not indulging this silly notion again. She has wanted this as much as you have, for as long as you have, and you feel like a villain, like a dictator, like you are bleeding her dry for some impossible future, watching all the love in the world you share wash over the floor in sorrow. You are done with watching love die a thousand grisly deaths at the hand of a god that knows no mercy.

You want to be happy. 

You want her to be happy. 

You want to be happy together.

There are plenty of ways to be happy without a child and you and your wife have been lucky enough to discover every one, little sunbursts of treasure hidden in the earth that you unearth, one after another, like little rest stops on the way to the greater pot of gold at the end of the earth. You are the second son (once the third, but not anymore) of a lesser Wizarding family, one that doesn't need more heirs (which correlates quite directly with more enemies, especially with all of you as outspoken as you are) now that your older (once the oldest, now your only) brother has a son.

A beautiful boy, with cheeks like apples and a smirk that could bring God to his knees. His eyes disappear when he smiles, and he smiles often and proudly, daring the world to not share his joy. You fall for him in a thousand new ways every time he comes racing up to your front door with a story to tell. He's got a room in your house, the innumerable drawings he leaves behind plastering the walls like wallpaper, and it looks like the aftermath of a hurricane because you'd never ask him to clean it.

You go look at the mess of his existence sometimes, a fond smile on your face, imagining a little person living in it full time, wading through the papers and crayons and relics of boundless jubilation. 

You imagine a little boy with your wife's eyes, and maybe your nose, and his cousin's knowing smile, racing little plastic cars around the perimeter of the room. You imagine a little girl, braids tied off with ribbons, with a set of watercolor paints she inevitably spills all over the carpet. You imagine yourself comforting her while you erase the evidence with a wave of your wand, imagine yourself holding her gently like the treasure she is. A little girl with plasters on her knees, climbing the fruit tree in your front yard. A little boy with his nose in a book, sitting on the kitchen counter. 

All these ghosts cover every inch of the house, a thousand children that could have been. Somehow you fill the empty spaces they've left behind by giving the love you would have given them (should have given them) to your brother's boy, your only hope, the closest thing you have to a child of your own. The closest thing you might ever have, and he's seven already. In four more years, he'll be away at Hogwarts. Seven years after that, he'll have his own life and you'll be left, bereft, all over again.

You taught him how to bowl a leg spin yesterday, made him watch you do it again and again until he felt confident enough to try himself, and then spent an hour sitting in the grass, watching him practice, determination furrowing his brow, until he could repeat it twice in a row, then thrice. He reminds you of yourself, eternally seconds from shrieking with joy, so thrilled to simply be alive, and you wonder if, someday, you will be lucky enough to teach your own child the things you lavish on your brother's. 

You cycle through the array of ghosts in this room alone, impose the faces and stories you've dreamed up for them on the grape hiding somewhere in your wife's abdomen. Maybe this one is a little boy that likes puzzles, solving all the problems in the world in between chewing up his board books. Maybe this one is a little girl that likes to play Quidditch. Maybe this one is a little boy with more friends than he can count, a little girl with a smile that could rival the sun. 

Maybe this one is the child that survives.

You are thirty-five and you are tired of being sad and by the time this baby comes, you will be thirty-six, which is uncommonly old for a first time parent, among wizards and Muggles alike. 

Maybe you were just never meant to be average. 

Maybe your child will be as special as their circumstances.

You are twenty and you're holding a baby. 

Your baby. 

He has your wife's eyes and pink, shiny gums for miles, and his little nose is just so small. 

You haven't seen too many babies in your life, but if anyone had told you they'd be this small, this fragile, you'd have balked at the idea of having one of your own. Maybe it was for the best, then, that you didn't know, that you assumed he'd come in neat, adult proportions, inflating himself like a balloon the second he was out in the world. You know, logically, that him growing up will take time, that a few years from now, between your personality and your wife's, he'll be talking so much that you'll miss today, miss a time before words and friends and tantrums, but you wish you could talk to your son now and hear him talk back.

You wish you could see understanding in his eyes when you tell him how hard the past two years have been. How you've seen friends and foes alike fall on the battlefield and each death in the Order, whether you knew them well or not, feels like an insult to the earth that nurtured them, the parents that raised them to do the right thing, the world that needed what they had to give. The world that will never get that. 

You have seen people ripped apart and bleeding die on your doorstep, have seen your wife sacrifice sleep at the altar of healing others, have seen far too much for your baby to ever comprehend. You know the feeling of waiting for news far too intimately, have received too many black envelopes from the Ministry, have felt each loss like a hot poker through your chest. 

You are still waiting on your cousin's body, all these years later, some small part of you wishing that he might be alive out there, might be waiting for you.

Here you are, holding this innocent, precious thing, and wishing peace into his heart. Here you are, with gentle hands and a gentler smile, a built in role model for this little boy that is going to see so vividly that the world isn't made to comfort him, to contort itself into a cocoon around him so he has time to become whoever he wants. You will be that cocoon instead. You will stare down death for this boy, who's currently sucking on your pinky finger, and death will lose.

Confidence is never something you've been short on, but maintaining it, especially lately, is a struggle. Remembering, in the depths of war, that you are sacrificing for a good cause is a luxury afforded to few. Money can only do so much. Status can only do so much. Blood can only do so much. You are terrified to bring this brilliant son of yours into such a world, but he's here now. All you can do is keep him here, succeeding where you never had before.

You waited for Neil to come home for three weeks before you gave up. And even now, it hits you like a hammer to the gut -- you gave up on him. You stopped waiting. You stopped sitting in the Owlery at Hogwarts, waiting for a letter that would never come. You haven't allowed yourself to give up on anything since, for better or for worse, and you hope your son will benefit.

It still feels like something is missing, even if you know in your heart that your cousin (your brother) is gone and never coming back, in every moment in your life. And now you miss him like a limb, the ease with which he'd declare all your worries pointless, the ease with which he'd remind you that you are uniquely qualified to love this little boy with everything you've got for as long as you can. You miss a world that never got to be, one where he steals Harry from your grip now, holds him close and tickles his little ears, tells him the same stories he told you. It's weird, mourning something that never happened. Neil is always going to be twenty-three and here you are, somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a half years short of the day your cousin died, with a child in your arms and fear consuming you whole.

You are in desperate need of reassurance, are projecting how much you miss your parents onto every single person you see. Frank tells you it's normal to feel like you're still a child yourself, like you need all the help in the world to this thing that should be natural, but Frank has his parents still. Yours are beyond your reach until this stupid war ends, and even then, they're old. You bear no illusions about how comfortable old age is -- part of growing up with parents carrying age old doubts and worries like yokes around their shoulders, slowly sinking further into the ground with each step. You bear no illusions about how happy theirs will be, with your child to brighten their days, either.

You've been called an incorrigible optimist in varying tones of surprise, dismay, and exasperation and you are proud of it.

""I think you're a miracle, Hari."" You trace the soft slope of his little nose. ""That's something we have in common, I think. My parents always said they knew I was special, the day I was born. I think you're gonna be special too."""

But he had already made up his mind. He was going too fast for Harry Potter on Karrwa Chauth. It's is a festival celebrated by Hindu women from the Indian Subcontinent on the fourth day after Purnima in the month of Kartika.

They had somewhat of an awkward friendship. Passing each other soft smiles as they walked past each other in Ministry. Looking for each other at ministry balls, even though they don't talk much but still keeping an eye on each other from afar.

It was the perfect opportunity, as Auror Potter, the Head of the Auror Department, and Minister Draco the Head of international relationship, were to invited the ball to Gujarat, India, along with other few members of the department. 

The ball was going to be held at a sanctuary to keep it enclosed from the muggles. Arrangements were made for them to stay there as well. The ball was on the same night as the festival. 

He already decided the best attire with the help of Pansy to wear on the ball night and the stuff he needed to break his fast was already arranged.

That morning Draco woke up before the sunrise to drink a glass of water as he won't get to drink any till night. He made sure to eat something that would last long throughout the day as well, as he had to make arrangements for the other guests arriving for the ball. 

It was no secret that Harry was pansexual. The world went upside down when Harry came out as a part of the LGBT community but the noise died down. 

""Any plans for tonight's ball?"" she nudged his elbow as he stood beside him. ""no, and don't you have a certain redhead to bother?"" he asked he checked the list of guests arriving.

""I do, but a certain brunette almost ate my brain asking me why the hell has Draco not eaten anything since the morning?"" she asked as she leaned in on her elbows and took the
quill from her hand.

Cheeks turned red he involuntarily looked at Harry with Ron who was seated a few tables away from them. He looked away as Draco caught him staring. He smiled and then looked down on his paper again.

""I have some plans,"" he said softly. Hermione sighed to herself as she watched the little scene unfold.

""What plan could possibly require you to starve to death?"" she asked as a matter of fact.

""you're smart Granger, you'll figure it out"" he smiled too sweetly, collected his papers, and left

Three hours later he returned to his room. it was still noon and he was already so hungry. As soon as he was about to close his eyes for a short nap someone knocked on the door. he groaned and got up.

""Weasley"" he regarded Ron.

""Malfoy"" he regarded back. Draco leaned towards the door. they also had an unusual friendship, not much close but he admired Ron. Especially his ability to play wizard chess.

""what do you want?"" he asked 

""we're going to the bazarre. Hermione wants you to join. No excuses."" He said with shrug. He knew denying Ron would only make the queen herself come upstairs to drag him down

""give me 5mins I'll be downstairs"". Ron nodded his head.

""took you long enough,"" said Hermione as she linked her arms with him. They hang out occasionally, and every time they do Hermione gives him a long lecture about how she could practically taste the sexual tension between him and Harry afterward.

""Sorry to keep you waiting your highness,"" he said as they all walked towards the main town. It was hot and if it wasn't for Hermione holding his hand he'd have already fainted.

Draco didn't let his fatigue show on his face but Harry still looked at him worriedly as they walked. Harry was always tongue-tied whenever Draco was around. He'd flush completely whenever they sat a little too close. 

He was such a gentleman to Draco that he had to calm down the urge to just snog the irresistible bastard right there in front of everyone. 

Draco looked back and saw Harry was just walking right behind, apparently checking out his ass. He hooked his fingers in his pants and pulled them a little up in an act to adjust them a bit, or really just highlight his ass more.

Harry tripped over his own foot and he looked up to Draco laughing at him. 

""Careful there, mate,"" said Ron. ""yeah,"" Harry said his cheeks turned red.

""c'mon I want to get mehndi, look how pretty their hands look"" she dragged Draco over to a small stall where a couple of Indian girls were applying Mendi on other women.

They sat on the empty slot. Hermione offered her hand to the man and he started to fill her hand with a beautiful design. The man in front of Draco looked at him warily, apparently not used to a man wanting to apply henna before.

He looked behind Draco and then immediately started working on Draco's hands. Draco looked behind him and saw that Harry was standing over him with arms crossed and a stoic face, the outline of his muscles clearly visible. Draco flashed him a smile and Harry returned it with as much sweetness. 

""I thought this would go along with your plans for tonight,"" said Hermione in his ear. Her smartness never ceases to amaze him. He surged with excitement that he forgot about his empty stomach.

They bought some souvenirs. Harry followed him like a puppy from shop to shop, taking every bag Draco purchased. Draco was enjoying it so much that he might have bought a few extra things that he absolutely didn't need just to make Harry work a little longer. 

When they got back to the hotel, Harry accompanied him to his room to drop the stuff off. 

""are you okay?"" he asked nervously.

""Yeah, why'd you ask?"" Draco answered. Harry caressed his nape in nervousness. Draco loved seeing him like this, the man can get the hardest criminal masterminds to open their mouth but in front of Draco, he was a nervous wreck.

""you didn't eat anything at the breakfast, and not even when we were out?"" he asked.

With a sudden wave of confidence, he said, ""oh, I'm fasting for you?"" he kept his tone nonchalant. Harry who mostly avoided looking Draco in the eyes, abruptly looked at him and stared before he could get his brain to function again.

""Wh... what? Why?"" Harry Potter stuttering, what would the Ministry say if they saw their precious savior like this. Draco smiled at that thought.

""yeah, I thought I'd do the wizarding world a favor by giving their golden boy a couple of extra years to live,"" he said as he watched Harry turn even redder if that was possible.

""meet me at the balcony after the ball Harry"" he stood on his tippy toes and leaned in to plant a soft kiss on Potter's cheek, carefully to keep his hands at a distance, and then walked into his room. 

Draco arrived at the ball at 7 pm, and as always he looked For Potter. When his eyes met him, Harry was already looking at him with wide eyes, Draco wore a red net Sari wrapped around his lithe figure so perfectly it looked breath-taking, and Harry did stop breathing until Ron kicked him in the foot lightly. The cut-sleeve deep neck blouse displayed his collarbones.

He walked towards Draco and offered him his hand. He noticed the Arabic mehndi on Draco's hand was so dark it was almost black. The fancy red bangles he wore made his hands looked so beautiful he never wanted to let them go. He kissed the knuckles and then tangled their hands together.

Harry was also wearing traditional Indian attire. A maroon red Kurta to match with black tight pajama and a scarf. His hair was a mess as always. His aura demanded respect in every room he walked not because he defeated Voldemort but because of who he is, which was just the perfect contrast as he walked towards Draco with a smile so bright it could outshine the sun itself.

Draco noticed that everyone was looking at him and he got a little self-conscious. Harry leaned in his ear and said, ""you look so beautiful Draco"". Draco flushed so hard at the compliment and the way his name on Harry's tongue that it made him forget his worries about any prying eyes.

Since gender-fluidity and equality were the hot topics in politics right now most of the guests encouraged him for showing the courage to break gender norms, some of them judged him but didn't dare say anything with Harry by his side. He didn't leave his side even for a second. Glared at anyone who got a little too close to Draco. He was absolutely enjoying the attention.  

 Draco saw Blaise walking towards, he was there to represent the American community in the wizarding world. Everybody knew that Draco was promised to Zabini by his father, but that world changed when Draco broke off the engagement when his father went to prison and proceeded to price everyone wrong who thought Draco will never be able to handle a position of power, including his father. 

 ""Potter"" they shook each other's hand with a tight grip. He took Draco's hand but instead of shaking he turned his hand and kissed his knuckles. ""you look lovely tonight Draco"" he said with a sharp smirk. Draco took his hand back with a tight smile ""thank you"" 

Harry felt Draco stiffen from Blais's gesture. he wrapped a possessive arm around Draco's waist and pulled him close. He rubbed soothing circles from his thumb on the naked skin which made Draco relax completely into him.

""I was hoping you we can discuss the American-British donation treaties after the party.,"" he asked taking a sip of his champagne. 

""it isn't much of a debate Blaise. Both the ministry decided that the fund will be going to the schools, instead of Zabini funds."" Draco replied with practiced ease.

""it's my money. I can take you to court for that"" Zabini's jaw tightened.

 Harry snorted at his statement, "" cmon Zabini we both know he'd smoke you in the court"". Zabini walked away. 

He also noticed that Harry wasn't eating anything either, ""why aren't you eating?"" he asked when they were finally done shaking everybody's hand.

""Didn't feel right that you weren't eating anything,"" he said casually as he shrugged his shoulders. Draco smiled so brightly that it almost hurt his cheeks.

He saw the moon was out in all its glory. He took Harry's hand and they both slipped away from the part. He brought them to the balcony where Draco conjured the things, he needed to break the fast.

""you know married people do this right"" Harry pointed it out. 

Suddenly embarrassed out of his wits, ""I... know that but it's not mandatory We don't have to-""

Harry cut him off, ""It's okay, I'll change that in a few years,"" he said with a cocky smile. Draco rolled his eyes but, but he smiled with relief.

Draco knew Harry was close with his family in India after the war so he knew how the custom goes. Draco read about it and he wanted to do it as it is. 

He picked up the sieve from the thali, looked to the moon through it, and then faced it towards Harry to secure its blessings.

""quit smiling you goof,"" he said because seriously his own cheeks were hurting pretty bad.

""I can't you look so beautiful like this,"" Harry replied. He circled the thali in front of Harry's face the agarbatti was already lit, its rosy scent only added to their environment. He prayed to every deity who would listen to him to wish all the happiness in the world to Harry along with a long and prosperous life.

Harry took the water from the thali and fed it to Draco. He stopped after drinking half and offered the rest to Harry.

Harry vanishes the content now that their fast is broken and kissed Draco passionately. He wrapped his hand around his slim waist and Draco moved his hands around Harry's neck.

Harry tugged Draco more strongly against him that it pushed the air out of Draco's lung in a gasp. He used the opportunity to explore the inside of his mouth with his tongue. He sucked on Draco's tongue which made him moan in his mouth.

Eventually, they break away for air. For a moment there's no sound except their harsh breathing and the clunk of Draco's bangles as he caressed his hair slowly. 

Harry was lost in the beauty before him, Draco's eyes were dark, lips all swollen and pink, and his cheeks were red. 

Draco's stomach made a demand, interrupting the moment and Harry burst out laughing.

""shut up, I hadn't eaten since last night!"" he whined.

""Sorry love, let's go feed you,"" he said as he walked them back to the party.

Harry vowed to himself to spent all his life plus those extra years Draco wished upon him to make him happy."

Summer break is over, and Neville's come to bring her home. It feels nice to think of it that way. The definition of home has changed multiple times over the years. Her chesire grin greets her older brother when she arrives. ""Annaiyya, are we leaving yet?"" Harry smirks at her fondly before chuckling, ""Calm down, your diwana isn't here yet."" She pinks at that, swatting his hand away from trying to pinch her cheeks. She walks away, feeling a flicker of annoyance even as she sends a mild stinging hex his way, and can't bring herself to be satisfied even by his starled yelp. 

Haru has yet to change into western wear, and can't bring herself to yet. This dress is the same glorious colour as Amma's hair, and it feels ever so luxurious and airy when she glides around a room with purpose. Harry on the other hand, has already changed into his robes, and her 'diwana' will be here soon. She debates changing, but decides not to. Potter crimson is a delicious contrast on her skin, and she looks and feels beautiful. 

Harini's slight embarrassment has yet to fade, but she still believes in the delightful phrase of 'showing yourself to your greatest benefit'. Maybe she's wearing it because she's comfortable. Maybe she's wearing it because it's a beautiful dress. Maybe she's wearing it because it's the same dress she wore when Neville helped her plant those roses around the pavillion in her private garden. Subconscious decision aside, it's beyond her.

It's a fluttery feeling to have someone described as your 'diwana'. Harini has had her fair share of admirers, but none that provoke her brother into teasing. She's fanning herself as she roams out onto the property, waving at the old family parrots and doves that have roosted in the banyan trees scattered around the estate. One of them, Krish, circles just above her head, long tail feathers waving behind him in that familiar shade of green. He pecks at her ear, nibbling and squawking out ominously. Harini tries to calm his fussing, until he screeches irritatingly close to her ears, ""Eagle! Eagle! Eat me!"" 

At the mention of eagles, Harini's eyes and head snap upwards with a reaction time the auror department would be scrambling to get their hands on. Sure enough, it's Neville's, and there is no time left to consider the whys and wherefores of dresses and parrots and infuriating older brothers. Gathering herself, she poises herself to greet Neville, only to find that she can't seem to find him. Harry has also rather mysteriously disappeared. The atmosphere seems ominous, and there is no noise for what seems to be miles, besides Harini's rapidly quickening breathing. 

Confused, she leaves the great hall accompanied by silence, roaming off to her garden to sigh in such a stereotypical manner that's almost embarrassing. Irritation is creeping into her again. It's so strange. Why can't it just be decent and uncomplicated? She stretches out her aura, trying to find any familiar magical signature. Faintly she can sense her parents and her brother, but Neville isn't anywhere she can detect.

She hisses slightly as she runs a finger over the tender flesh of her ear, nipped and bitten enough to be red. Why did Krish have to act up just then? Cursed timing aside, she focuses on the fact that she won't be seeing Krish again for another year, and tries to heal it quickly. Her magic begins to rush to the point of injury to heal her, but a voice murmurs behind her, ""Allow me, my lady."" 

Without turning around, she already knows that it's Neville. His fingers, roughened by years of gardening, are gentle when they run over the top of her ear, and without hesitating, they trail down to remove her earrings and replace them with a different pair.

Harini's breath hitches, and she can't bring herself to be upset with that bird and his antics anymore. It gave her a perfect excuse to come out here, and she can barely stop from pinching herself. Her fingers run over them, they're wild roses hammered out of gold, with rubies inlaid as petals, and tourmaline leaves that make a loop that closes in the back.

Her whole mind is occupied with the fact that earrings are a courtship gift, and that the comb she has in now is carved with roses.

Hours later, Krish gets a nice (if unwelcome) surprise, when Harini, who should be scolding him, does the complete opposite, and clutches the indignant bird in a breathtaking hug. Women (particularly the ones of this house), go by contraries, and this is one more problem that poor Krish will be forced to puzzle his wits over forever.

""Only the best for Malfoys. Malfoys deserve the best.""



The first time Harini had ever heard that was as a teatime inside joke, a running gag the family chuckled over a cup of chai. But when she'd been at those parties, she'd been paying attention. The best? She had always had wanted the best in one form or another. The best house, the best dancing, the best quidditch team, the best clothes...it had been said teasingly, possibly a nod to Narcissa Malfoy, who had been quite like Haru. Chasing after the best since day one.


From the day she'd tried to buy a solid gold cauldron (making her parents double over laughing), to the day she chased the snitch, Neville had liked to tease her, that she always seemed to be on the hunt for gold. If the dozens of hair ornaments, saree pins, necklaces, bangles, earrings and bracelets was anything to go by, her godbrother wasn't wrong.


The best of the best.



White peacocks were a rarity back home. They were vivid and blue and green and brown and gold, never pale as frost like Malfoy peacocks. Draco and Lucius had both been equally surprised when Haru sat down comfortably on a bench, only to be surrounded by birds moments later. The bolder of the peahens took it upon themselves to perch on her shoulders. Parasol twirling behind her, her voice full with easy laughter, Draco had walked her to the Abraxan stables. Harry would remark rather dryly years later that he'd had to pry them off of each other, no matter how often she swore up and down that it wasn't true. ""We were both so young!"" she'd cry, exasperated. The year she'd been sponsored was among the best years of her life. She had been given the best of everything. She had seen firsthand what it was like to be a Malfoy. She decided that she liked it.


Cream of the crop.



Cho Chang hadn't stood a chance at seeker tryouts. Years of being on the hunt for gold, competing with her brother; had made Harini a far superior seeker. Draco gave her a bouquet to congratulate her for her making of the team, so she kept Gladiolus and Ivy growing in her room year after year. When Draco cheered her on in a match against her brother, she took every word to heart. When they went to the Abraxan races, she'd clung to his every word about who he thought they should bet on that season. Hogsmeade weekends they'd spent together as well, sneaking Harry out of the castle so she could laugh silently at his begrudging thanks to Draco each time. Chaperoning Harry and Ginny, she'd always asked him to come with them, since she was sure they'd bore her to death. 


When Harini buys herself a new set of custom combs at the Enchanted Rose, she gets a set of gold Abraxans that Draco compliments her on without fail every time she wears them.


Creme de la creme.



Organza is one of the most finicky fabrics to sew. Haru doesn't care. Everyone is getting their gowns custom made at Olympus. Haru doesn't care. She has to dye it pink and dusty gold herself. Haru doesn't care. There are a hundred flimsy layers and the embroidery is impossible. Haru doesn't care. The cape is too tight around her neck and she has to redo it. Haru doesn't care.


What Haru does care about is the fact that she's going to be a Malfoy, and Malfoys only deserve the best. She doesn't trust anyone to do this right but herself. Her mind wanders to the neckline, the lowest she's ever worn. There is a grey diamond pendant on a gold chain nestled in her cleavage and a pair of possessive grey eyes on her by the end of the Yule Ball.

At the ripe old age of 6, Haru had arrived at Malfoy manor, clinging to her older brother while staring at the palatial grounds before her. The Malfoy family's ancestral magic clung to everything her eyes could see, and being a wary child, she refused to step foot through the wards until Harry picked her up to carry her through himself. She let out a quiet gasp, burying her face in Harry's cloak while her eyes darted to the Malfoys, who were getting nearer every minute. 

 

 



 

""So this is little Harini?"" Narcissa called fondly, waving at them while gliding down the gardens. James and Syra went to say hello, but Harini couldn't bring herself to face the pretty lady her mummy was reminiscing with. She had now managed to yank the cloak over her head until it covered her almost completely, her eyes peeking out from underneath the fine silk. She was enveloped in the safety of her brother's magic, and it was reassuring enough for her to tug at his sleeve to be let down.

 

Walking over with all the daintiness of a little lady in the making, Haru curtsied to Narcissa, before tilting her head upwards for those big blue-grey eyes to shimmer at her. Narcissa let out a soft laugh at that, picking her up to see her up close. ""My my, such a lovely young lady for me to foster! Syra, you're too kind, and believe me, she has your eyes."" Haru felt a flush creeping up on her cheeks. She was lovely? Her family told her that often enough, but there was something so exciting about hearing it from someone new.

 

""I have a gift for you pet, tell me if I've made the right choice."" Lucius walked over, carrying a wrapped box with a silvery ribbon tied over it. His eyes sparkled with mirth, following every little excited giggle Haru let out while unwrapping it with all the clumsiness of an excited child. ""Oh, I love it!"" 

 

In Haru's little hands was a parasol, an airy one made of sky-blue silk, trimmed with french lace and dappling her in the warm morning light. She didn't catch the weighty glance her father gave Lucius, she was altogether too excited by her present. ""Did mummy tell you that my favourite book is The Blue Umbrella? Is that why you got it?"" Narcissa smiled, picking her up again to kiss her soft cheeks. ""You're going to be a Malfoy for the year. Which means you'll only be getting the best, ma petite fee. I mulled this over for quite some time, but I was sure you'd like this from the moment I saw it."" 

 

The best? Haru liked being the best, and she certainly liked having the best, if it meant having things like the parasol. ""I like being a Malfoy then. It seems fun."" Syra and James just barely stifled their laughter, though a few errant giggles bubbled out nonetheless. A voice sounded behind her. ""Well of course it's fun, but 'fun' isn't enough to explain what being a Malfoy's like."" 

 

So this was Draco Malfoy. He was her older brother's age, which must mean he was 7 already, probably almost 8. ""I've got a whole year to learn what it's like, so don't-oh what's the word, daddy? Paperise? Paterise?"" James chuckled, getting down to her level to look her in the eyes. ""You mean patronise, don't you kannamma?"" Haru nodded, turning to stare at Draco. ""Exactly that. I'll know everything there is to know about it by the end of the year, just you wait!"" 

 

That night, Haru sat in the pretty bedroom Narcissa had set up for her, and watching the muslin drapes sway in the milky haze of moonlight was enough to distract her for a minute or two, before she shook her head to get back to the task at hand. 

 


Dear diary, 



 



My sponsorship starts today. Lady Malfoy is so nice to me, and Lord Malfoy gave me a beat beautiful umbrella, just like Binya had in the book! I'm very tired, I spent the last our hour chasing peacocks, they're so funny, they're not like our peacocks, they're all white and they have no blue at all. I guess all the blue is in my parasol now. Don't you like my handwriting? My governess, Miss Clearwater, she's been making me write only in cursive. I think I'm starting to be good at it. 



 



Goodnight Diary,



Haru     




""Weren't you just chasing them a month or two ago?"" Draco called, running to catch up to where Haru sat surrounded by peafowl. ""Since when do they get along with you?"" Haru glared at him, but given that she was glaring through a faceful of a peacock's fanned out tail, it would have been a miracle for him to even see her frowning, let alone be intimidated by her. ""They like me just fine, you just don't know that."" she huffed, pulling the young peacock off her lap and onto the cobblestone path benath her feet. She picked up her beloved parasol, and she was dressed to match it today, in a pretty sundress with lacy trim and a fluffy, light petticoat to make it flare out around her. Oh, how Narcissa had squealed upon realising she now had a little girl to dress up. Haru didn't mind at all, Narcissa was good at finding pretty dresses for her, and Haru felt special whenever she was allowed to get a new dress custom made.

 

The parasol served it's purpose well, keeping them both out of the heat while they walked to the stables. ""Draco, you're 8 now."" she said, making him stare at her for a moment before responding that yes, he was in fact 8 years old. ""Well, since you're older than me, can you go on the big Abraxans instead of the ponies?"" Draco shook his head, looking wistfully at the pegasi that utterly towered over him. ""Not yet. Father won't let me."" Haru frowned, pulling him along while they walked ahead. ""Daddy lets Harry go on a broom and all, but he isn't allowed to ride either. Mummy says it's because horses have a mind of their own and you need to build up trust and partnership with them before you ride."" 

 

""Oh whatever,"" Draco groaned, shoving his hands into his pockets in a way that his mother would have boxed his ears for. Haru took his silence as an invitation to continue, and oh did she ever. ""Heiress Macnamara came over the other day. She gushed all about her bonding, apparently she's bonding on Yule this year! It's ever so romantic, isn't it? She's got such a pretty bonding gown selection too, she let me see them! All floaty, she's going to look like a fairy! Are we going to be invited to go, Draco?"" 

 

Perhaps hearing Haru use 'bonding', 'fairy', 'romantic' and refer to herself and the Malfoy family as 'we' was the reason a flush burned across Draco's face. Haru, ever the happy child, thought nothing of it, and simply used her magic to cool her hands, only to watch in horror as his cheeks only got redder. ""Draco! I think you might be having a heatstroke! We should go inside, you don't look very well."" Draco just stared off into space incredulously for a moment or two before agreeing to let her pull him along back into the manor.

 

""Mere! Draco is completely red! I think he's been out in the heat for too long, his face looks like a lobster's."" Narcissa fussed over him for half an hour, as she was wont to do, before shooing them out of the parlor to go play together upstairs. Somewhere between mortified and thoroughly humiliated, Draco collapsed into one of the cushions laying around the aviary. Haru, incorrigible as ever, immediately ran to the birds, talking a mile a minute about some vivid mental gymnastics of princesses and peacocks and silk ribbons on bonding gowns. Draco's embarrassment was obvious in his magic, and Haru picked up on and ran over to him. 

 

""I don't like it when mere fusses either, but it was for your own good!"" Draco, in no mood to explain himself, simply got up and took Haru by the hand. ""Will you sneak off with me? I want to figure out how to ride a broom before your brother does."" Haru's delighted giggle resonated through the high glass room, startling some of the hawks. ""Let's go, let's go, let's go! Oh, I can't wait to see Harry's face when I can do a barrel roll on a broom better than he can."" 

 

One might consider it prophetic that Lucius, despite having overheard this exchange, chose wisely not to interfere, but instead let them be. In any case, the early start may have been what Ravenclaw's quidditch team would owe their fantastic victory to a decade later. Perhaps it was for the best Harry wasn't aware of what gave his sister the advantage, because that knowledge might ensure that Haru's beloved childhood broom wouldn't come out of it unscathed.

 


Dear Diary,



 



I think Draco isn't very well today. He did take me flying tough, and he said to keep it a secret from everybody and that it's just between us 
two
 both. I had fun, and Draco didn't even look queasy anymore after he got on the broom. Maybe he just 
acted 
like he wasn't well to get out of going to the stables with me. No, I don't think he would do that. Oh, mere's calling me to come have dinner. Sorry I can't write much diary, I do so much all day and then my bedtime is so soon after dinner that if I write I can't read a bedtime story anymore. I promise to write more, mummy says I should, because 'sponsoring is the most special part of a child's life and something that should be remembered.'



 



Goodnight Diary,



 



Haru



 


 

 

 



""Oh, do you remember this?"" Haru exclaimed, levitating the memory book closer to where she and Draco were sitting. The book was flipped open to a page-wide picture of Haru getting a kneazle as a present before she left Malfoy manor. Spinel, her much beloved pet, had been only a month and a half old in the picture. Now, older and fluffier, this feline carried himself with all the princley demeanor that came with having a Potter maiden's love. He was 9 pushing 10 now, and had very comfortably wrapped himself about Haru's leg while she sat on the stable roof with Draco in the receding daylight. Draco leaned lower to take a look, and it made Haru's heart race at the direct reminder of how different he was to the child she had grown up with. ""You were squealing so loudly father was afraid we'd have to replace our heirloom stained glass windows."" 

""Is that- Is that a KNEAZLE!"" Haru's high pitched screech rang in Draco's ears, and he had half a mind to call his mother, but his friend's pure happiness and the sheer joy on her face was enough to soften his annoyance. ""Well yes, it's for you."" Haru's baby blues had just looked beseechingly at the kitten before they went wide with  excitement at his announcement.  "" I'm going to name him Spinel! ""  


 


Haru then proceeded to spend the next half hour babying the thing and fussing over it like she was it s mother. Every little kitten sneeze made her gasp, it s mouth opening in a small yawn would make her sigh, and seeing it fumble inelegantly over its own paws only made her giggle fondly. Draco was sure she had bloody well fallen in love with the damned thing, and he wouldn't know until years later just how right he was.

Haru turned to glare at Draco, her face halfway buried in Spinel's silky grey fur. Pulling her kneazle away from the hug, she tugged him to her chest and huffed indignantly. ""I reacted like any reasonable young lady would, so don't you go implying anything else."" Draco threw his head back to laugh, and Haru swore she could feel the intensity of the sound resonating in her own bones from her place tucked comfortably next to him. ""Yes, you reacted like any reasonable young lady. A reasonable young lady, mind you, who would someday become a spinto soprano in Flitwick's choir."" At that, even Haru had to laugh, remembering fondly her head of house's surprise when she turned up to try out for his choir within a week of being sorted into Ravenclaw, before belting a note in 'Memory' for a solid ten seconds. 

 

""I like to think I'm talented."" She teased, before flushing and feeling glad it wouldn't show on her skin when Draco looked at her with such softness. ""I absolutely agree with you, only, will the lady entertain my request to demonstrate one of these many talents?"" Haru giggled, pulling Spinel into her arms before running down the edge of the roof to the staircase on the sides. ""Come on already, I've been practicing a new dressage routine for weeks!"" She called, racing off to go find Lunala and get her saddle onto her before Draco could catch up to her. "

Draco holds the limp, lifeless body in his pale arms. Pale, except for the Dark Mark permanently fused into his forearm. 



The Boy Who Lived.



Now, The Boy Who Died.



The battlefield is clear now, except for Draco pointlessly holding Harry Potter in the middle of a decimated Hogwarts.



Tears stream down Draco's cheeks unchecked and unnoticed. The last few months of working as a spy for the Order, pointless. Draco's secret relationship with Harry, gone. The future they had planned together after the war, vanished.



Nothing matters anymore. Not his father's expectations or his mother's promises of a better life or Draco's now destroyed dreams. 



Draco's whole world is lying stiff in his arms. There will be no more midnight kisses, no more racing heartbeats, no more stifled laughter under the sheets, no more brightness in Draco's cold life.



Cold.



Everything is cold now. 



Maybe it always has been.



Draco reaches and grab's Harry's forgotten wand, Draco's long-lost somewhere in the battle.



Fresh tears fall from Draco's eyes. ""I'm so sorry, Harry. I failed you. I should have here. I should have protected you and fought by your side. I could have saved you. I could have 

protected

 you dammit!"" 



He sobs softly, caving in on himself. ""I can't do this, Harry. I can't go back to the Death Eaters and pretend like we didn't happen."" 



Draco brings Harry's wand to his own temple. ""I won't do it. I won't be alone again.""



A deep breath.



""Obliviate.""


 


--



""Draco!""



Draco's eyes snap open to Harry shaking his arm, a look of concern plastered on his face. It's still dark outside. Definitely not waking hours.



""I'm up, I'm up."" His body is sticky with sweat from the nightmare. Draco groans as he sits up, rubbing his face wearily. He catches a glimpse of the Dark Mark on his arm and closes his eyes against it. 



""Sorry that I woke you up,"" Draco leans over and plants a small kiss on Harry's still-creased forehead. ""Go back to sleep, babe.""



Harry's darker-skinned hand raises up to cup Draco's cheek. ""You were screaming... You screamed my name.""



Draco merely nods.



Harry frowns even more. ""The war?""



""The war.""



Harry brings Draco into a hug. They both have nightmares. There are things that will never leave them. ""If you ever want to talk about it, I'm here. I'm right here.""



Draco nods, real tears slowly filling his eyes. After a minute, he managed to choke out, ""You were dead. You were dead in my arms because I didn't fight beside you and I didn't block that curse from Bellatrix.""



His chest was caving in, his lungs collapsing. He gasps for breath, but finds none.



""Hey, hey,"" Harry says softly, letting his partner go immediately. Instead, he takes Draco's hands in his, knowing that any more touch than this during one of Draco's panic attacks will only make things worse, unless specifically asked. ""Look at me. Draco, baby, look at me. I'm here. I'm right here. Take a breath with me, okay?""



Draco takes a few shaky breaths, but barely calms down. ""It was so real. You were dead and gone and I was alone and y-y-you...""



Harry nods, kissing Draco's hands softly. ""It wasn't real. I'm here with you. I'm not going anywhere. It wasn't real.""



Draco looks straight into Harry's eyes for the first time tonight and nods slowly. He starts to slowly get his breathing under control. 



""Come here,"" Draco whispers, pulling Harry in close for another embrace. 



""I love you, Potter.""



""Potter?"" Harry chuckles, exactly the reaction Draco was hoping for. ""Are we back on that again?""



""Besides the point. I love you.""



""I love you too, my Draco.""

Neville leaned over the balcony, looking down to see the commotion outside. There was altogether too much excited yelling outside. Today was Raksha Bandhan. Harini had invited him over, smiling and sunshiny. Uncle Sirius and Aunt Janaki were having a real time of it trying to round to boys up, so that Haru could give them their Rakhis. To start off the day spectacularly, Harry had been dangling upside down on his broom, before righting himself and remarking rather cryptically that his little sister had a surprise that he wasn't sure he liked. Before Neville had even had the time to decipher what that statement was supposed to mean, he had zoomed off, calling to see where Haru was. He hadn't even seen her yet. Uncle Sirius had been dragging Aries and Leo downstairs, while Aunt Janaki had given him a tray of Kaju Katlis and sent him off to the balcony.





 

In all the chaos of the occasion, Deepika had managed to get away from her grandmother, who was trying in vain to get her dressed for the occasion. She'd run off to go find-""Akka!"" , she yelled, her voice carrying all the way to Neville. He could hear a faint clinking of bells-Haru's anklets-and some hushed giggling, before he heard Haru's voice. ""Kannamma, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be with Ammamma? You aren't ready yet."" Neville heard the pout in Deepu's tone. ""I wanted you to dress me! You always pick the nicest dresses Akka. You look so pretty today too! You should wear green and red more, it suits you!"" He stopped really listening after that. Red...and green? Had he heard her correctly? Lost in his thoughts, he didn't realise that they'd left, until of course, he hear Haru's unmistakable shrieking. ""Anna! You idiot! Get down from there or I won't let Amma give you any of the sweets I made."" A peal of laughter-Harry's, he realised- rang out, and then Deepu let out an indignant squeal. She did hate getting picked up without warning. 

 

A faint knock sounded on the door behind him, and he heard Padma Patil's voice from the other side. ""Neville? You there? Atthamma said I'd be able to find you here."" Shaking his head in an attempt to clear his thoughts, he went to open the door. Padma cheerfully handed him a deep red envelope, a jalebi, and tied a Rakhi around his wrist. ""Happy Raksha Bandhan!"" she smiled, before tilting her head in the direction of the noise. ""Harry and Parvati are waiting for me,"" she said, ""I really should get going. But I did want to give you the Rakhi Akka and I made for you before the party started."" Waving, she ran off to the gardens and the quidditch pitch, where everyone else was gathered. Neville ran a hand through his hair in frustration. Aunt Janaki had asked to stay here, Deepu had mentioned something about her sister in green, and the Patil twins had given him their Rakhi and left for the partying. Where was Haru? It was unlike her to forget. Wasn't she going to give him some kind of surprise?  What was going on?

 

His eyes trailed over the latticework Aunt Janaki had done over the rooftop gardens. It was all carved flowers and gemstones. His mind wandered to the flowers Haru had worn over the years. Jasmine, the smell of it so strong that it was burned into his memory. It had hung tantalisingly from her hair, looped up in swooping vines and braids. Hibiscus, as wide as his outstretched palm, tucked behind her ears carelessly, no matter the colour. Pink, yellow, red, orange, like a burst of sunset haze, or deep blue and white and violet, like a twilight sky. Bougainvillea, stalks of it wrapped around her skirts as foliage whenever she decided to attend the ministry gala in western robes. Honeysuckle and Wisteria, the same flowers that he'd seen growing out of the window box in Haru's weaving room for years now. Roses, so vivid that-""Neville?"" The minute he turned to face her, his eyes widened.

 


She was dressed in his colours. She was wearing House Longbottom's Evergreen. She was in Longbottom green, and she hadn't given him a Rakhi.


 

The flush barely showed on her face, but her ears pinked at his expression. Neville on the other hand, was far too preoccupied with staring at her. The brilliance of the green was all the more visible in silk, and he could practically feel her magic radiating off of it. 

 


She'd woven it herself.


 

The skirt flared out around her, starting at her hips and flowing outward elegantly, trailing slightly on the ground. The outward edge shimmered in gold, and he realised that like Aunt Janaki, the gold on her dress was real gold. Gold that was hammered into thread. Her blouse matched the skirt, with Potter crimson sleeves that stopped at her elbows, and while the neckline wasn't deep, it was wide, and her collarbones were magnificent, even in shadowy, spotty light under the Morning Glory trellises. The crimson saree piece draped around her still exposed most of her stomach on one side, and the bangles, the necklace, her armbands, the waist band, her earrings, they were all green and gold. 

 

But the one detail that kept him staring was her hair. Dark, thick, and wavy, it tumbled down her back before it stopped just above her knees. The pin she'd been given on her coming of age ceremony years ago was tucking the hair back on one side, while gold peacock feathers and roses were braided through the rest. While the sheer amazement of seeing it open and left down was encompassing most of his thinking mind right now, a small voice in the back of his mind was yelling distantly, telling him that something was off. Hadn't Deepu been bragging to his mother that her sister's hair was long enough to touch the ground? Why had it suddenly gotten shorter?

 

He barely processed the sound of her anklets as she walked closer, his mouth was still dry. ""Ha-Haru?"" His voice was a faint whisper, he barely heard it himself over the sound of his own heartbeat. His eyes raked over her hands, detailed painstakingly and beautifully with scenes of gardens and palaces and kings and princes and queens. Spread out over the backs of her hands were peacocks flirting their tails at the viewer, and trailing down her arms were dancing princesses and lotuses and swordfights. The sheen of her magic, a soft shade somewhere between cream and off white was shimmering over her fingertips, and before he really understood what was happening, she was right in front of him, looking fearlessly up at him. Wordlessly, she summoned the hair she'd cut into her upturned palms, and Neville couldn't do anything but stare. Stare at the apparition who appeared before him, offerring everything he'd ever wanted for him to have with Harini. 

 

""I-I haven't wanted to give you a Rahki in four years; Nev,"" she said softly, her hands shaky. ""I haven't-I haven't invited you over for Raksha Bandhan for all this time, because I can't convince myself to just let you be a-a brother to me. I want something different, something more than just that. I want you and I to have the kind of love I'm a witness to everyday. The way dad calls Amma Jaanu, the way they laugh and have that-that companionship, they have each other and they're happy, and-"" she stopped, her arms still quivering from the weight of the confession. She seemed to steel herself before offerring him the braided hair that had been woven into a soft, clothlike piece, decorated with gold, flower-shaped pins. ""I don't ever want to give you a Rakhi. I want to give you my, hand, my love, my soul, and if you'll have me-""

 

He kissed her. A hand cupping her cheek, another to steady her.

 

When they pulled away from each other, Haru's relieved chesire grin looked back at him. ""I reckon this is the sort of surprise Harry didn't want me to recieve?"", he chuckled softly, tilting her chin up to look him in the eye. Haru giggled at shook her head, the motion making her hair swish behind her. ""He said that he wasn't sure if he liked it. I think the plan wasn't stupid enough for it to be any fun for him. Not enough stupid risks. Still, he's your godbrother, and he thinks you're the best choice I could've made out of all of them."" She put one of her hands on top of the hand he held her cheek with, breathing in deep. 

 

""Would you like to hear a secret? I asked Amma to have this garden. I asked her if it could be mine. I wanted something that would keep me thinking of you, no matter how far away you felt."" 

 

""Would you like to hear a secret? I've wanted you to be mine for years. I asked myself if you'd be mine. I wanted something splendid that would make you realise I was in love with you.""

 

A pretty picture to add to a garden full of them, Heir and Heiress walked out arm in arm, Rakhis and brothers alike all but forgotten in the little tableau of human love and happiness they made. At any rate, neither was much missed, since the younger a sister is, the easier to get a rise out of her, and everyone was thoroughly entertained by good company, good food and festing, by antics and mischief and excitement, and almost nobody noticed a lovely young thing in green running up and down the stairs.

She's laughing into Harry's shoulder at something she can't manage to say between her constant giggles and the muffling of wool. Harry himself is all sweet affection where he's draped over Cho, beaming smile squished where his cheek presses against her dark hair. It'd be a nice sight, seeing them so happy and relaxed, if the Leaky Cauldron wasn't closed and Hannah wasn't glaring daggers at him.


            He adores Hannah, she's very sweet, but even she doesn't want to try and move his two soulmates when they're like this. Harry and Cho don't get rowdy when intoxicated. But they do get awfully clingy, and intoxicated they are. Cedric doesn't know how or why considering neither of them usually drink very much and both are lightweights but Hannah had contacted him via floo and demanded that he come pick them up.


            Harry spots him first and Cedric knows because his eyes light up and he does this sort of excited and pleased wiggle, like he can't contain himself. Harry can get pretty nonverbal without warning but he's always liked when Cho talks and doesn't like to interrupt.


            Cedric crouches in front of them, the scuffing sound of his shoes perking up Cho, and lets Harry cup his cheek in his right hand. Warm and dry with a smattering of callous, he leans into the familiar gesture. Harry nearly coos with delight at the reciprocation, even after all these years, which sends both a bubble of warmth through him and prods awake something vicious and mean.

           
He hates the Dursleys. He hates the people who would take a baby and hurt him as he grows until the boy they produced was convinced that he didn't deserve to be loved and that a hand on a face was always going to be a slap. He hates the people who are still the reason for cold sweat nightmares after war and rebuilding and struggle. He hates Harry's personal monsters in the closet. Merlin, he still hates Dudley a good bit despite his 3 years of efforts to make amends and the consistent therapy the two were doing now.


            And the worst thing? The worst thing is that Harry forgives them. The worst thing is that Harry forgave them so quickly even though it wasn't good for him. Sometimes, Cedric wonders how he's the Hufflepuff.


            Cedric doesn't know why his soulmates are sitting on the floor but he takes the opportunity to just look for now. It's nice with Harry's thumb gently stroking his cheek and Cho's hands playing with the lapels of his peacoat. He lets her reel him in with little tugs until his lips meet hers, soft and sweet. He can feel Harry's fingers tangle in his hair and heat of breath and scratch of beard against his neck. They fit together, not in a way that came naturally but from long habit. "" 'm sleepy,"" someone murmurs. There's giggles all around, muted and flagging.


            Cedric hauls Harry up first because he knows that Cho will find her feet by way of the solid grip Harry has curled around her waist. Harry will never be good at letting go.


            It's a little bit of maneuvering to wiggle his way under Harry's lanky weight and they're not at all balanced with Cho's toes barely touching the floor. Hell, Harry's toes are barely touching the floor though it's not for lack of trying on his soulmate's part. He's pretty sure that Harry's trying to climb him, if not like a tree then like a bed. If there was ever a moment Cedric wished he was taller or stronger, this would be it; buried under the deadweight of two people he has to move.


            A laugh startles him. He looks up from under what feels like Harry's entire upper torso to see Hannah with her head down on the bar, shaking with helpless giggles. She props her head on one hand with an amused grin stretched into her palm. ""How far do you think you can carry them?""


            He tries to scowl at her from around Cho who's gotten loose of Harry's grip and is half hanging from his neck and playing with his cheek, trying to pull his lips into a smile. ""Home, hopefuwaugh,"" as Cho hooks her thumb under the corner of his mouth.


            ""Cedric, you need to smile more,"" Cho tells him very seriously. ""You're too frowny."" He looks at her with her overly serious and flushed face. Harry's stubble is rubbing against his forehead, probably nodding in agreement. Cedric grasps her by the wrist and extracts her fingers from his mouth. He mock growls at her before pressing a kiss to the back of her knuckles.


            ""Need some help?"" Hannah asks as she weaves through the tables. Gently, she snags Cho's sleeve and thank the stars because Cho immediately latches onto her. Harry, though, makes this sad, little, hurt sound. Cedric feels his heart skip, thinking Harry's gone and hurt himself. That is until Harry nearly topples both of them by reaching for the two women.


            ""Can't I just stun them?"" Cedric hauls Harry into something resembling a fireman's carry. ""Real quicklike and then I could levitate their unconscious bodies home, to bed even."" Hannah laughs, not because she's cruel but because she knows he'll never do it. Waking up stunned and hungover isn't something he'd curse anyone with.
""Go home Cedric,"" Hannah says. ""I'll feed your Cho up with something to absorb the alcohol. Make sure that one."" She points a finger at Harry's (in Cedric and Cho's opinion) nicely shaped posterior. ""Has some water before he crashes."""

1972


It was the last day before the Christmas holidays and different to that time the previous year, young Sirius Black was happy about that, because this year he didn't need to go home. He was going to stay at James' place and it was going to be bloody amazing!

As soon as he and his friends had boarded the Hogwarts Express and were seated in a compartment they started plotting potential pranks. They had sweets from the trolley witch and arrived in London in no time. 

In the corner of his eye Sirius saw the stern look of his mother, but the next second he found himself engulfed in a big warm hug like he'd only ever gotten one from Mrs. Potter. They flooed straight from platform 9  3/4  to Godric's Hollow. 

As he stepped out of the fireplace, the first thing his eyes fell on was a rather small but colourfully decorated Christmas tree and a wave of pine sent hit his nostrils. Sirius sighed. This was already miles better than every Christmas he'd ever had at Grimmauld place. Everything in the Potter's house was cozy and welcoming. He had been there before shortly, but at this time of year it was even better. You could feel the Christmas spirit in the air. As Sirius stood there dumbstruck, James wasn't that enthusiastic. ""Come on, Sirius"" he pestered, ""Let's go to my room"". 

The young Black pulled himself together and followed his friend upstairs while Mr. Potter levitated their trunks towards James' room where a guest bed had already been set up. Even though they had a perfectly functional guest bedroom, the Potters figured that the two best friends would want to spend as much time together as possible. And they were correct. 

They hadn't even set everything up yet when Mrs. Potter called them for dinner. At home, he and Reg normally ate separately in the kitchen and the food that the house elves made was tasty, but you could definitely taste all the love Mrs. Potter had cooked into the food. It was more than just nutrition. 

It was already late when the boys went upstairs that night after a lovely board game night, but they talked for another two hours after. James' breaths got deeper and deeper and after a while Sirius heard the silent snores he was so used to. His friend had fallen asleep but the boy lay awake for a few more minutes processing all the new impressions of the day. Then sleep came over him as well with a smile on his face. 

Even though he had gone to sleep later Sirius awoke before the young Potter. Like it always is at a friend's place, he didn't dare to wake him up, so he waited, his gaze going through the room. All the walls were cluttered with Quidditch posters and James even had a framed trikot signed by his favourite player. There were also shelves filled with some books, trophies from James' childhood Quidditch team and clutter. Like the rest of the house it felt like home. Sirius' room at home was actually inspired by this one. 

""Mornin',"" mumbled a sleepy James as he yawned and stretched.""Good morning mate,"" Sirius greeted him in return. After they had gotten dressed they made their way downstairs. In the hallway they already smelled bacon and eggs and it was only then that they realized how hungry they were. They set the table and waited impatiently for Mr. Potter to finish cooking. ""Did you sleep well Sirius?"" he asked as he scrambled some more eggs ""Yes, thank you,"" the boy replied politely. 

Nothing spectacular happened that day, but it was great nonetheless. The boys went outside to play Quidditch in the backyard that was enchanted so that muggle neighbors couldn't see anything suspicious and overall had a lot of fun. It was Christmas Eve, and the Potters, who were actually quite fond of muggle things and technology, and their guest spent the evening in front of the TV. Sirius had never seen something like that before. He'd never thought that something like that would be possible without magic. That night, it was even harder for the boys to go to sleep. The excitement was too big even though none of them believed in Father Christmas anymore.

"" Hey!  "" Sirius heard a whisper. Still mostly asleep he grunted and turned around, facing away from the disturbance. ""  Come on, man  "", then Sirius was poked in the side. He didn't react. The next thing he knew were fingers all over him. James had decided that a tickle attack would be the only way to get the attention he wanted. ""Stop!"" Sirius squealed, attempting to roll off the bed to escape. He grabbed his pillow and hit his bed friend with it. Soon it had turned into a full on pillow fight. 

When they took a moment to breathe James remembered why he had originally wanted to wake up his friend. It was Christmas day! Said friend had come to the same conclusion almost simultaneously. ""It's Christmas!"" they screamed in unison and proceeded to run down the stairs.

Hearing the commotion the boys running down the stairs created Mr. and Mrs. Potter came out of their bedroom, smiles on their faces. They were happy that their son had something like the sibling he had always wished for. 

They spent Christmas day with James' extended family. The house was full of cousins, aunts, uncles and other relatives. They had food Sirius had never encountered before. Things like samosas, chicken tikka, batata vada, bhajias, chutneys and so on, most of which had been brought by the family, were shared around. Sirius was seated with James and all of his cousins. Later when they had finished eating and started to get bored they played games. 

Together with three of James' cousins, they sneaked outside into the garden, starting an epic snowball fight. The adults seemed to ignore the underage magic they used to create the quickest and most unerring balls. Frozen to the bone but happy they got back inside just in time for dinner.

Overall Sirius had a lot of fun and by the sounds of it the adults did as well. The whole atmosphere was cheerful and easy, so different from everything he was used to and Sirius loved it. 

Most of the people stayed the night, so as James' room was occupied all the kids slept on the living room floor on a lot of blankets and pillows. 

Boxing day and basically the rest of the holiday they spent playing with their presents and Quidditch. As early January came around, they were reunited with their school friends on platform 9  3/4 . 

 


1980


A few years later Sirius still vividly remembers that particular holiday season.

Over the years he had had so many lovely winter holidays with his friends. 

In their 4th year James, Peter, Remus and he had spent Christmas at Hogwarts because the full moon fell into the break. 

After that they had started the tradition of throwing infamous New Years Eve parties at James' place with all their friends on one of which he had shared his first kiss with the love of his life and one of his best friends. 

When James and Lily (finally) got together, their friend groups merged and Marlene taught them how Hanukkah was celebrated. 

It was safe to say that the winter holiday season quickly became Sirius' favourite time of the year. 

This year however, the situation was different. The war had become more and more dangerous and a big party was not a thing anybody in their right mind would do at that point.

And another thing was very different from the previous years: there was a sleeping baby on his chest as he lay on the sofa, his head on Remus' lap. Harry, his godson and if you asked Sirius, the 5 month old was the sweetest and greatest child that has ever been.

So he lay there, as a tipsy James and Peter got into an argument over the game of wizards chess they were playing and his boyfriend talked to the mother of the baby, Lily, who was sitting in an armchair across from him, reminiscing about the past year and his life. 

In silence he thanked the Sorting Hat for putting him into Gryffindor.

She had crept out of her bed and room and headed down to the living room, where she saw her amma curled up on the rocking chair, nursing a cup of tea while staring fondly at Al's appa, who was sprawled across the couch, making jokes. ""Amma, appa,"" Al whispered. They both looked up to see her staring at them, her eyes wide and teary.


A concerned expression crossed her amma's face. ""Come here, baby,"" she said, setting her tea down on the small side-table next to her and patting her lap.



Al ran across the room to spring into her mother's lap and wrap her tiny arms around the woman. ""What's up, Al?"" Al's appa asked, turning to face them.



""Can I tell you something?""



""Of course, baby boy,"" Amma said. Al cringed in her lap.



""I don't think I'm a boy,"" she whispered. Her amma and appa's eyes widened as they stared at their daughter.



""Well then, what do you feel like?"" Appa asked, sitting up and turning to her. The two identical pairs of green eyes stared at each other solemnly.



Al tore her gaze away and instead looked down at her tiny hands. ""I'm a girl,"" she said.



Her amma's grip on her tightened and her appa moved again, this time so he was kneeling in front of them. ""Okay,"" he said. ""Do you still want to be Albus Severus?""



Al shook her head. ""No,"" she said. ""It's a boy's name."" Her appa nodded and kissed her on the forehead.



""Okay. How about you go to bed and your mom and I will discuss your new name?"" Al nodded at him. Her amma seemed reluctant to let go of Al even as her appa picked her up.



""I love you, baby b-girl,"" she said, her words soft.



""I love you too, amma,"" Al said, with a bright, tired smile. 



...



After Al had been put back to bed, Harry and Ginny were sitting back in the living room. Ginny was on Harry's lap and he had his arms wrapped around her, his chin resting on her shoulder.



""We need to talk to Mione and Lu,"" he finally said. Ginny nodded and bit her lip.



""Yeah,"" she said. ""We do. Oh, and I'm choosing Al's name this time."" Harry pouted but didn't disagree.



""So what do you think about all this, Gin?""



""I think we need to be supportive. I'm happy Al feels comfortable telling us this and we're going to make sure we're worth that,"" Ginny said.



""You're right. We'll get Hermione, Ron, Rosie, and Hugo here tomorrow and talk to Lu tonight. I want them to bring Lysandra and Lorcan with to talk to Al. Hermione can show us how to do name changes and help us find everything we need to help Al. Maybe we can talk to some people in the trans community to? Go to one of the meetings with Mione?"" Ginny chuckled and relaxed in his arms.



""You're so 

prepared

,"" she teased. ""What happened to the reckless, impulsive boy I fell in love with?"" 



Harry grinned down at her and pecked the crook of her neck and shoulder. ""He grew up and got a family."" 



Ginny turned her head to beam brightly at him before asking, ""What do you think about Alice Minerva for Al's new name?""



""I like it. Nev and Minerva may cry when we tell them, though,"" Harry said. Ginny giggled and relaxed against his warm, solid chest. 



""And it can still shorten down Al if our baby decides he--she wants a more gender-neutral name.""



""Perfect. We'll talk to Jamie and Lil in the morning?""



She twisted to attempt to nuzzle at his his golden-brown neck. ""In the morning."" She paused for a second. ""Har?""



""Yeah, love?""



She looked up at him and could see every amber and copper fleck in her chocolate-brown eyes. ""We're good for them, right? Even though you and I aren't in love the way people think parents should be? Even though I'm ace and don't really think about sex except for our kids?"" Harry tightened his grip on her and kissed her on the nose.



""Calm down, love. We're great parents--our kids love us, Al-Alice felt comfortable coming out even if...she's still young and somewhat naive. We are good parents.""



Tears welled up in her eyes. ""Thanks Harry.""



""No problem, Gin.""

""To Mrs. Dursley,



It is my deepest regrets to inform you of the tragedy that occurred the night before last. Your sister Lily and her family were attacked in their home. As you might have heard from her, our people have been engaged in a war of sorts with a man named Lord Voldemort, or more commonly known as 'You-Know-Who', and his supporters. Lily and her husband James were a part of this resistance, and their involvement made them a target. At this time we do not know how Lord Voldemort found Lily, as she and her family were under our most secure protection. Yesterday, one of our supporters went to visit Lily only to find the house destroyed and your sister and her husband murdered. We believe their son, Hari, was also a target but for some unknown reason, he survived the curse that killed his parents. As you can see, a wound was caused by the ineffectiveness of the curse, which will no doubt leave a scar. Somehow, Hari's survival meant the downfall for Lord Voldemort. He is a hero in our world. It is for this reason that we ask you and your family to take in Hari, and raise him away from the spotlight.



I know this is an incredible amount of information to receive in a letter. Should you have any questions, do not hesitate to send an owl to myself or to Professor Dumblefore, the headmaster of Hogwarts.



Regards,Minerva McGonagallHogwarts HeadmistressProfessor of Transfiguration""


The letter was written in green cursive on sturdy parchment, and had been found on the front step of Petunia Dursley's house. Or rather, the letter was on top of a bundled baby that had been lying on the stoop. Such an occurrence had been quite the shock to Mrs. Dursley, who had only sought to grab the early November's morning paper. Instead, she had received both the paper and another child.

She lived with her own husband Vernon and their child, a boy named Dudley not much older than Hari. Petunia and her sister Lily were very much estranged, due to the fact that Lily was a witch and Petunia vowed to hate everything that involved magic. See, she was a Muggle and therefore resented Lily for having the magical skills she herself did not possess. The jealous, spiteful voice in the back of her head privately thought it fitting that Lily's beloved magic was her downfall. 

Still, the part of her that felt for her sister wept at the thought of her mangled body being found by a visitor next to her crying baby. Petunia wiped away a stray tear, and picked up her nephew whom she had laid on the sofa before reading the letter to examine him more closely. He was still asleep in his blankets, and from what Petunia could see, he looked absolutely nothing like his mother. Where Lily was red haired and freckled, Hari had black hair and dark brown skin. Petunia had never met James, but had seen a picture (a moving picture) of him on the wedding invitation Lily had sent. The Dursleys has agreed right away to decline the invitation. Not only was the wedding to be magical, but also interracial. Now, Petunia held the offspring of that marriage cut short. In addition to his features that seemed unseemly to Petunia, almost the entire left half of Hari's face was covered by a fresh cut that started at his hairline and branched out like a bolt of lightning. Petunia couldn't help but think what a pathetic looking child he would become.

Hari must have felt his aunt's scrutinizing gaze, for soon enough he gave a small yawn and opened his eyes to return her stare. Petunia gasped and nearly dropped the boy when he did this, for his eyes were nothing short of unnatural.

His right eye was brilliantly green in color, just as his mother's had been. This resemblance might have been enough to touch the last of Petunia's humanity had his left eye been the same. Instead of green, this eye was almost completely white. The pupil and iris were fogged over from where his scar continued across the eyeball's surface. The boy began to wail in confusion as both eyes flit around the Dursleys' living room, but only saw about half of it. 

Petunia tried to hush him so as to not wake her husband and child, but to no luck. She heard Vernon's heavy footsteps as he got out of their bed and started down the stairs.

""What in God's name is all that racket?"" he whispered loudly from the staircase.

Petunia just looked up at him, trying to summarize the situation in a way that makes sense. ""My sister, she and her husband were attacked. Their son survived.""

She held out the letter to him. She could only imagine what was running through Vernon's mind as he glanced between the letter and the wild looking toddler.

""We're not keeping him, we already have a child of our own,"" he said sternly.

""I don't want him anymore than you do, but please, Vernon, he doesn't have any other family - Lily is dead -"" she protested. Somewhere above them, Dudley began to wake due to the noise.

Vernon sighed angrily, but with an air of defeat. ""We'll talk about this later, when it's not bloody six in the morning. Bandage the boy's face, if you insist on keeping him. I'm going back to sleep, and I pray that Duddy will too.""

For the next several weeks afterwards, Vernon tried to find an orphanage or adoption agency that would take the boy, but to no avail. Looks like they would be raising the small, scarred, Indian boy themselves."

Likewise, not every story ends with an 'All is well'.

This story begins, as most stories of this nature do, with a boy who is not quite as perfectly normal as the aforementioned Mr. and Mrs. Dursley. No, this boy is very peculiar indeed. (A fact that would no doubt send these perfectly normal Dursleys into a right tizzy.) This remarkably strange boy, on an unremarkably average day, is currently sat on an unremarkable bench by an unremarkable park, waiting for an unremarkable bus. He would seem to all the world like an average boy, that lives an average life, if it weren't for the pale scar that runs down his dark forehead, splintering out like a bolt of lightning. Furthermore, the fact that instead of being accompanied by a similarly dark-skinned father, he's joined by a large black dog would signal to any passerby that perhaps this little boy is not quite as normal as one would presume. The boy is made all the more peculiar by the fact that he seems to be talking to the dog, and not in the way that young children talk to animals, but as if the dog could really understand him. The boy even asks the great beast questions as though it possesses some sort of knowledge other dogs lack and is able to respond to him in kind. Had Mr. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive seen this unorthodox behavior, he would have most likely muttered to himself about the states of kids today and parents who didn't know how to discipline their child. But never mind that boring old Mr. Dursley, because, as all of us In The Know are aware, dogs are quite smart creatures, but none so smart as this young boy's.

Indeed, just at this moment, the dog's ears twitch and he jumps up, waging his tail and looking between the corner and the boy. As the young boy stands the bus rounds the corner and the dog gives an excited yip at the sight. The boy, whose name happens to be Harry James Potter (for those of you that are interested in such things), smiles at the dog and digs into his pockets for his bus pass. With his pass held firmly in hand, he clips a leash to the dog's collar with a look of regret. The dog's tail immediately ceases its excited wagging and his head turns to face the boy with a sad look on his canine face.

""Sorry Padfoot, you can't get on the bus without a leash, you know that,"" comments Harry, scratching behind the dog's ears. Padfoot, as the dog is named, wines and looks at the boy with large, sad grey eyes. Harry pouts at him and crosses his six-year-old arms. ""I can't let you off Padfoot! Uncle Moony will be mad at us, and he won't let us have any chocolate!"" It would perhaps seem strange to a passerby to hear a young boy use such a threat against a dog, for it is common knowledge that dogs cannot eat chocolate. Yet, the boy holds the threat over his dog confidently.

Padfoot seems to shrink down, as though thoroughly chastened by Harry's words and the mention of this 'Uncle Moony'. Harry nods with pleasure and smiles to himself. The unremarkable bus pulls up to the stop with a rather loud screeching of breaks. The doors hiss open and Harry climbs into the vehicle, tugging a reluctant Padfoot along with him, and swipes his bus pass where the bus passes are swiped. He pulls Padfoot along with him as he walks to the back of the bus. Their destination is a long way from the unremarkable park he had been playing in for most of the day.

Harry sits down on the uncomfortable bus seats and Padfoot jumps onto the seat next to him and rests his large head on the boy's leg. Harry looks down and scratches behind his ears.

""I know you don't like the bus, but you can't use your magic or the Min'stry will be mad and they'll send 'rors after us. Moony's almost got it fig'red, then we can Ap'rate all over, and we can get Dad's cloak so we don't ever hafta worry about the Muggles seeing us, and we won't ever hafta use the bus again,"" Harry tells the dog in one long stream-of-consciousness breath that only the youngest of children and the most caffeinated of Uni students can manage. Padfoot huffs and turns away, as though he had heard the argument a million times, yet still doubted it's veracity.

There is no doubt in this author's mind that had someone overheard the boy's words they would not have noticed the dog's strange actions, but rather the strange words the boy had used. Perhaps they would have asked themselves what a Muggle was, and what this 'Min'stry"" and their mysterious ''rors' had to do with it. Luckily for Harry and Padfoot, no one was close enough to have overheard the strange words.

Quite some time later, many miles from the park, Harry disembarks the bus. He is followed not by a large dog, but rather a young man with stylishly long black hair and glimmering grey eyes. No one seems to notice this change of companion, which is perfectly fine with the boy and his guardian. The two of them proceed to walk a ways from the bus stop, turn the corner into a dark alley between an ice cream shop and a bookstore, and promptly disappear with a sound like a car engine backfiring.

Many miles away, in a small village far from the hustle and bustle of the city, a young boy with a lightning scar and a young man with long black hair walk out from behind a particularly old tree near the edge of the bordering forest. None of the inhabitants of said village pay them any mind, except to offer kind smiles and a treat for the young boy. Harry smiles back at them and thanks them for the small cakes and sweets, sharing a few with his guardian. The townsfolk nod at the man and converse about such things that adults feel the need to converse about. One such townsperson, a woman with a penchant for gossip and matchmaking, asks him if he is ever going to find a nice girl to settle down with, and remarks that spending so much time without a mother figure couldn't be good for poor Harry, and had he met Mrs. Harris's niece, she's a beautiful girl and wouldn't he like it if she could add a nice feminine touch to that dreary old cabin he and Mr. Lupin share? The man smiles nervously and subtlety taps Harry on the shoulder, prompting the young boy to yawn as if he were thoroughly exhausted by his busy day, though the young boy still felt energetic. The man smiles at the woman and picks up the boy (who was, in Harry's opinion, far too old to be picked up in such a way, thank-you-very-much, as he was now six and that meant he was a Big Boy) before apologizing. He explains that they had a very long day, and poor Harry really should be getting home for his nap. He carries Harry all the way down the old dirt road toward the small cottage at the edge of the village that they currently inhabited.

The man opens the cottage door and smiles as the smell of home fills his nose. He also smells the distinct scent of stew and fresh baked bread.

""Moony, we're home!"" The man calls, setting down Harry and walking toward the kitchen. Harry takes that as his cue to run to his room and play with his toys.

""Hello Sirius,"" a much taller man with slightly greying brown curls turns and smiles at Sirius when he steps into the cozy kitchen, ""how was the park with Harry?""

""It was great! Harry swung on the swings, and we played fetch, and there was this girl with really bushy hair that came over and to play with us and she gave me part of her sandwich!"" Sirius regales happily. His smile slips into a frown and his eyebrows furrow. ""But then her mum came over and asked Harry where his parents were, and Harry told her they were dead. So she asked where his guardian was, and Harry pointed over to me and told her that I watched him when he played and his uncle Moony watched him at home,"" Sirius sighed and slumps his shoulders. ""I don't like not being able to go out with my godson as myself Moony, and Harry can't keep going out with just Padfoot. More people will start to notice that he doesn't have a parent with him, and not all of them are going to be nice to a young Indian boy,"" Sirius frowns, resting his back against the counter and crossing his arms over his chest.

""I know Pads, but we can't risk someone recognizing you. You know the Ministry has been circulating your face all over the Muggle news channels, not to mention the wizards looking for any sign of you,"" Remus carefully wipes off his hands and reaches out for Sirius, caressing his cheek. Sirius sighs and leans into the touch, closing his eyes. ""As soon as we can figure out how to find Peter, and prove your innocence, you can take Harry out as much as you like,"" Remus leans down and presses a kiss against Sirius's forehead.

""You've been saying that for five years Moons, and we're still no closer to figuring it out,"" Sirius opens his eyes again and stares up sadly into Remus's amber eyes.

""We already have your plea prepared, we just need to find Peter. If we can find him, we can prove you didn't do it,"" Remus reassures him, stroking his long fingers through Sirius's long hair. Sirius laughs coldly and shakes his head.

""Peter could be anywhere in the world. How do you suppose we find one rat in a world of them? Even just one specific rat in England would be difficult,"" Sirius scoffs, ""it'll never work. I'm doomed!"" Sirius sighs dramatically.

""I'd tell you to stop being dramatic, but I don't think you know how, Padfoot,"" Remus smiles, rolling his eyes.

The tall, scarred young man smiles as he remembers his time as an adolescent in a quite remarkable school known as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The school itself is located somewhere in Scotland, though if someone like Mr. Dursley or Mrs. Harris were to attempt to look for it, all they would find is an old castle, crumbling away in the highlands. The reason for this is, if the name itself didn't already give it away, that the school is magic. Rather, there is magic in the school. Special spells have been placed on the grounds so that no Muggle (non-magical folk to answer that question from the bus), can stumble across it by accident. I'm sure you can imagine the mess it would make if some poor unsuspecting Muggle were to wander upon a castle where children ages eleven through eighteen were flying about on brooms and waving around sticks all day. Now, when Remus Lupin and Sirius Black turned eleven they were both accepted into this magical school, along with one James Potter (father of Harry incidentally), Lily Evans (who became Lily Potter), and Peter Pettigrew. I'm sure you know all about the incidents that occurred at Hogwarts between the years 1971 and 1978, so I won't bore you with all the details. As it happens though, our Remus Lupin was, at that very moment, thinking of a very particular event in his life at Hogwarts: the completion of The Marauder's Map.

""That's it!"" Remus exclaims. Sirius sits up and levels him with a confused look. ""The Map! The Marauder's Map!""

""What in the name of Merlin are you talking about?"" Sirius questions him, contemplating if he should call someone to check on Moony's mental health.

""The Map could find him! Or something similar, at least. We wouldn't even need to track everyone, just Peter,"" Remus rushes over to the other side of the kitchen, which is, admittedly, not that far away, and grabs a notebook because honestly, it's ridiculous to expect two twenty-somethings to keep track of sheaves of parchment with a six-year-old around. ""We'd need the original Map of course and our notes. I think I have most of those in some boxes somewhere, and I think James kept his in the Potter vault, so we'd have to go get them, which could be difficult. We'd also need something of Peter's so the spells can hone in on it, then we'd just need to draw some maps to narrow it down and we could-""

""Remus.""

Remus stops and turns back to face Sirius. The twenty-seven year old's face has far too many lines for a man that young, and the defeated expression on his face shows every one of them.

""Remus, we can't get the Map. It's back at Hogwarts in Filch's office after he confiscated it from Peter in seventh year. Even if we could get to it we had two other Marauders helping us when we created the first Map. I don't know if we could do this without them,"" Sirius shakes his head again. ""It's no use, Remus.""

""No,"" Remus strides forward and grips the sides of Sirius's face, tilting it up so he can look directly into the smaller man's grey eyes. ""No, we are not just going to give up. We can find Peter, and we can bring him in, and we'll get him to confess, even if we have to Crucio it out of the rat, and then you can take Harry out to parks and wherever else you want to take him. You can be a proper family that goes on proper holidays and you can take him to Diagon Alley and buy him another broom. We can do this, Sirius,"" Remus brushes a loose strand of hair away from Sirius's face carefully.

""You're wrong,"" Sirius shakes his head, shaking the strand free again. He looks back up at Remus, if you'll pardon the pun, seriously. ""We can be a proper family,"" Sirius smiles at Remus and stretches up to kiss him lightly on the lips. Remus smiles into the kiss and pulls him closer, kissing him slightly harder.

""Eeeww!"" Harry's high six year old voice breaks the relative silence and the two adults step away from each other and look to the doorway, where Harry is standing with a grossed out look on his face, for as you must know, it is never fun to see adults kissing, especially when it's your parental figures. He clutches a stuffed stag with small little circular glasses to his chest.

""C'mere Prongslet!"" Sirius says, crouching down and picking up Harry, despite the child's squealing protests and valiant efforts to avoid his godfather's arms. Sirius rests him on his hip and gives Harry a calculating look as the young child sticks out his tongue at him. ""What do you think Moony,"" he turns to the other man and smirks, ""shall we have venison tonight?""

Now, Harry, being six, has no idea what 'venison' means, though he can conclude, as can you if you are unfamiliar with the term, that it roughly translates to 'six-year-olds named Harry Potter'.

""I don't know Padfoot, he looks a little scrawny,"" Remus responds, considering Harry's figure. ""Perhaps we should fatten him up a little more,"" Remus tickles Harry's sides and smiles at the young boy, who turns his pout to Uncle Moony, deciding Uncle Padfoot has already endured it enough and surely Uncle Moony needs to be properly chastened for his comments.

""You're absolutely right Moony, he does look a bit thin. Short too, don't you think?"" Sirius's grey eyes glint in a way that, had he still been at Hogwarts, would have meant he had just pulled off a truly marvelous prank on his brother and his fellow Slytherins. ""I think we should do something about that, don't you?"" Sirius grips Harry by the legs and flips him upside down, shaking him slightly and causing the boy to squeal in delight. Fortunately, Remus knows Sirius's mind and had the foresight to remove Harry's glasses from his face before Sirius flipped him, which otherwise would have resulted in the eye-wear falling to the floor and breaking. Again. However, this doesn't stop Harry from losing his grip on his deer, or for the subsequent fall endured by said deer.

Remus picks up the toy and sets it carefully on the kitchen counter. He watches them with a fond smile on his scarred face as Harry squeals.

""Moony, I do believe we need another opinion on how edible this young boy is.""

""But of course!"" Remus takes Harry from Sirius with a grin and watches as his figure seems to shimmer, and then suddenly a large black dog is standing where Sirius just was. ""Come on Padfoot!"" Remus lowers Harry, despite the child's screams and squeals, and the large dog bounds up to him, licking at face energetically.

""Stop! Stop, Padfoot!"" Harry laughs, wiping at his face, swinging slightly with the movement. The large dog sits back on his haunches and watches with a tilted head as Remus sets Harry down. There is a moment, one of those moments best described as the calm before the storm, where Remus makes eye contact with the dog and a sense of dread fills him.

""Padfoot, no!"" Remus says, attempting to avoid his fate, but it's too late. The large dog bounds forwards and collides with Remus, sending him through the doorway onto the floor of the living room. Remus laughs as the dog covers his face with kisses, though his nose wrinkles at the dog breath, despite the fact that the dog is, in fact, a person. Harry launches himself at the werewolf (because there is no possible way that a man with the name 'Remus Lupin' is not a werewolf) and attacks his sides with his tiny fingers. Remus roars with laughter as his body constricts from the over-stimulation of the six-year-old fingers digging into his ribs.

A cough sounds from the fireplace behind them and suddenly Remus has the full weight of a five foot eight inch man on top of him instead of a full grown German Shepard. He groans and pushes Sirius off him and he tilts his head back.

The upside-down head of Arthur Weasley greets him. Remus, as well as Sirius and Harry, picks himself up and grins apologetically at Arthur.

""I do hope I'm not interrupting a family bonding moment,"" the disembodied head of a portly ginger man says from the green light of their fireplace.

""Not at all, Arthur. You know we always enjoy your check-ins,"" Remus responds smoothly.

""What do we owe the pleasure, this time?"" Sirius asks, having hefted Harry onto his hip and wordlessly and wandlessly Accio'd the child's glasses from the kitchen counter Remus left them on.

""Molly was wondering if you'd like to come round for supper on Saturday. Ron's been asking after Harry and Percy wanted to ask Remus a few more questions about what to expect at Hogwarts,"" Arthur chuckles and his head turns in a way that, had it been attached to his shoulders, would have translated into an amused shake. ""He doesn't trust his brothers enough to ask them, smart lad. Wouldn't be surprised if he ended up in Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor if I'm being honest. And the twins always love it when you come round.""

""Of course we'll be there, Arthur,"" Remus smiles.

""Fantastic! I'll just go tell Molly then!"" His head starts to disappear but comes back suddenly as he remembers another message he is supposed to deliver. His bodiless head turns to face Sirius straight on and his expression is far more serious than before. ""Oh, and before I forget, Dumbledore said he might have a lead on how to prove your innocence. Nothing definitive yet, he just thought you ought to know."" With that, the fireplace roars green and the flames die back down to their more natural orange.

""That's what, the fifth time this year Dumbledore's had a lead?"" Sirius remarks dryly. Remus nods in agreement.

""You know he was fond of James and Lily. He wants Peter found as much as we do,"" Remus reminds him, though at this point the words have become as stale as month old crackers.

""Are we gonna see Ron?"" Harry asks excitedly from his perch on Sirius's hip. The former Black heir, for that is one of the many things Sirius is, sets him down on the floor and kneels in front of him.

""That we are Harry! We're going over to see Ron and Ginny and all the other Weasley's on Saturday!"" Sirius explains, just as excited at the six-year-old.

""What day is today, Harry?"" Remus asks, kneeling down beside Sirius.

Harry worries at his bottom lip in six-year-old concentration.

""Today is Wednesday because we went to the park, and we go to the park on Wednesdays and sometimes Sundays,"" Harry proclaims proudly. Remus grins at him encouragingly.

""That's right, Harry! Today is Wednesday, and we're going to the Weasley's on Saturday. How many days is that?"" Remus prompts. Sirius holds up his hand for Harry to count on and both of the adults watch as Harry carefully touches a tiny finger to Sirius's much larger ones.

""Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday!"" Harry exclaims as he counts on Sirius's hand. ""That's four days! 'cept it's three and a half 'cause today's Wednesday and it's almost over!"" Harry beams at Remus and Sirius, the latter of whom grins right back and holds up his other hand for his godson to high five. He does, cheerfully at that.

""That's right Bambi. Just three and a half days and you get to see your friends again,"" Sirius reassures him. Harry considers this statement, then frowns and shakes his head.

""No, 'cause I've got loads of friends! There's Ron and Ginny and Fred and George and Percy and Charlie and Bill, and I'll see them Saturday. But there's also 'Moine and Dean and Alec and Lisa and Frankie, and I don't see them all the time, only sometimes on Wednesdays and sometimes Sunday if I'm extra special good. And I don't see them all the time, 'cause sometimes they're not at the park and sometimes we go to different parks. But that's okay, 'cause if we don't we'd get caught and you and Moony would hafta go away with the 'rors,"" Harry's large green eyes, so like his mother's, look up at his guardians widely. ""And then I'd hafta live with Aunty Petunia and Uncle Vernon and cousin Dudley, and I don't like them!""

""Don't worry Prongslet, we won't let that happen,"" Sirius reassures him after exchanging a worried and slightly amused look with Remus. Harry just grins at them.

""I know!"" He tells them, skipping away happily to his room in that way young children do.

The look shared between Remus and Sirius this time has lost the amused part and is just worried.

Now, if you remember I said that stories begin in many ways and blah blah blah. Well, on that note, this story's true beginning is not with a remarkable young boy and his remarkable dog waiting for an unremarkable bus by an unremarkable park. This story has many beginnings before that, and even many beginnings after, but the real beginning of this particular story happened on October 31st, 1981. As you most likely already know, that was the night Lily Potter nee Evans and James Potter were killed via the Killing Curse by one Tom Riddle, more commonly known as Lord Voldemort, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, or You-Know-Who. This left poor little Harry Potter, only a year old, without his parents.

Now, here's the interesting part of this familiar story. There was a moment, a blink and you'll miss it moment, where Harry's life could have gone a completely different direction. He could have ended up in a basket on his Aunt Petunia's doorstep with a note from Albus Dumbledore. He could have grown up in an abusive house and rarely felt love until the age of eleven. This Harry would be angry, scared, and most likely very reckless. Luckily for Harry, his life did not end up that way, I mean could you even imagine?

No, luckily for Harry his godfather Sirius Black is not a complete idiot and Apparated away from the scene of the crime after Peter cut off his finger and blasted the street, killing those Muggles. Also luckily for Harry, Remus Lupin happened to be at home on the night of Halloween and was there when Sirius discovered Peter's betrayal. Unfortunately, Harry was still taken to his Aunt and Uncle's house in Surrey, but with the combined prowess of two Marauders and the xenophobia of his aunt and uncle - who did not want to raise a half-Indian child, much less one with magic - he was spirited away before a full week had passed.

Unluckily for Harry, there were other Muggles on that street that saw Sirius and, before they were Obliviated, told the Aurors they saw a man with long black hair point a wooden stick at the man he called Peter right before the blast took out the street. This, of course, means that the Ministry is on the lookout for the traitor Black, who sold out his friends and murdered poor Peter Pettigrew and is now on the run with known associate Remus Lupin.

Luckily for all three of them, no one in the Wizarding world was aware they had the Boy Who Lived with them.

November 28th, 1981 found Remus Lupin and Padfoot with a year old Harry in the field surrounding the Burrow, the magically enlarged house belonging to the Weasley family. While they only really knew each other in passing at Hogwarts, the way many housemates did, the two of them had heard a great many things about Molly Prewett and her husband Arthur Weasley from the Prewett twins, Fabian and Gideon. They were hoping the fellow Gryffindors would hear out their story instead of immediately calling the Ministry and sending Aurors after them.

Padfoot pads along behind Moony, the tall grass passing by in shades of grey as they carefully make their way toward the Weasley's front door. Remus's head is almost constantly twisting around to watch their back and check for someone following them. One hand grips Harry's back and keeps the sleeping child to his chest, and the other keeps a tight grip on his wand. Padfoot's own hackles are raised and his ears are constantly twitching around, listening for out of place sounds. They are habits left over from the war they only just escaped and, not even a month after the unfortunate circumstance that brought about that end, they have yet to rid themselves of those habits.

""Remember, as soon as you hear Arthur at the door, transform back. Not a moment earlier, not a moment later,"" his eyes flick down at the dog briefly before scanning their surroundings again. ""Understood?""

Padfoot nods his head and watches as Remus's shoulders relax for a fraction of a second before tensing again. The large dog's head looks around and his nose twitches again as he scents their surroundings, but there's nothing unusual. Remus turns down a dirt path toward the mismatched house Sirius's distant cousins inhabit. Remus shifts Harry carefully in his arms so as not to disturb the sleeping child, for the screams the tiny lungs could unleash could summon the Aurors all the way in London. They both pause before the Weasley front door and Remus hovers a fist over the wooden door, glancing down at Padfoot. Remus knocks twice and Padfoot's ears twitch as they listen for footsteps. Heavy steps approach the door and Sirius shifts back to human form just as Arthur Weasley opens his front door.

""Remus? What?"" His blue eyes flicker over to the man beside him and he pales, taking a step back. ""Siri-""

""He's innocent!"" Remus interrupts. ""It's okay, he's innocent, I promise!"" Arthur looks back to Remus and finally notices the sleeping child in his arms.

""Is that-?""

""It's Harry,"" Remus nods and looks over Arthur's shoulder into the house, then behind him into the open field. ""May we come inside? It's too exposed out here for what we need to tell you.""

Sirius has kept his grey eyes on the field and road behind them since the moment Arthur opened the door.

""I, er, well, that is to say, uh, I suppose?"" Arthur's eyes keep flickering between Harry, Sirius, and Remus as he stutters.

""Thanks Arthur, we'll try to be brief,"" Remus says as he shoulders into the house, Sirius following him quickly, leaving Arthur to close the door behind them.

""Who was that, dear?"" Molly Weasley asks as she steps into the entry, looking down at her apron as she wipes her hands.

""Hello, Mols,"" Sirius greets her happily. Molly's head snaps up and her mouth falls open. Remus sighs and shakes his head, hands already moving to cover Harry's ears. ""Now, before you say anything-""

""SIRIUS BLACK! IN MY HOUSE! YOU MURDEROUS TRAITOR! HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING TO YOUR BEST FRIEND?! AND NOW YOU DARE WALK INTO MY HOME AS IF YOU AREN'T WANTED BY THE MINISTRY! AND HOW DO YOU GREET ME? AS IF WE WERE FRIENDS!"" Molly's face has gone as red as her hair as she yells at Sirius. The young man shrinks down at the words like a slowly deflating balloon. She takes another breath but before she can, Remus has handed a crying Harry to his godfather and stands in between the angry woman and the man he loves. His expression is cold and murderous.

""Listen to me Molly Weasley, and listen carefully. Sirius is completely innocent of all charges laid against him. He would never, NEVER, have betrayed James or Lily like that, and if you remember anything from our time at Hogwarts you would know that. He's Harry's godfather for Merlin's sake! Do you really think he would do that to Harry?"" Remus's voice is eerily calm as he stares Molly down.

Two young boys, a few years older than Harry, waddle into the room, their brown eyes wide and their red hair fluffy. Their wide eyes flicker between their parents and the two strangers in their home. They briefly rest on a sniffling Harry before returning to their father's face.

""Mum was yellin',"" the boy on the left says as he grips his twin's hand.

""Ron got scared,"" the other twin said.

Arthur kneels down and looks his sons in the eyes. ""It's alright, boys. Why don't you go up and play with your brothers, alright?"" The boys glance at Remus and Sirius one last time before nodding as they leave the room.

""Let's move this to the kitchen,"" Arthur suggests, standing back up and gesturing over to the room Molly just came from. Molly chases after him, her voice low as she whispers at him sharply, but both Sirius and Remus can hear her.

""Honestly, Arthur you can't just invite a wanted criminal into our home!"" She scolds him, glancing nervously back at them.

""Molly, you know how close Black and Potter were at Hogwarts. Do you really think he would have done what the Ministry says he did?"" Arthur whispers back.

""But he's a Black!"" Molly hisses back at him.

""And so was my mother!"" Arthur responds, voice no longer quiet.

""I think you'll find, Molly dearest, that I am, in fact, only a Black in name and that it has been this way since I was sixteen,"" Sirius responds, brushing past her into the kitchen. Her cheeks flame again.

Of course, dear reader, it could be said that Sirius Black stopped being a Black the moment he was sorted into Gryffindor, but that is neither here nor there.

""Please, do sit down. We'd love to hear your side of what happened,"" Arthur tells them, gesturing to the empty seats at the table. Remus looks at Sirius and Harry and frowns.

""Could we perhaps let Harry play with your children? I'd prefer it if he weren't here for this,"" Remus asks them with a smile. ""I'll take him up,"" he adds at Molly's suspicious glance at Sirius.

""Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt,"" Molly acquiesces, sparing another glance to Sirius.

""Sirius, would you mind starting while I take Harry to-?"" Remus looks at Molly and Arthur for guidance.

""Bill's room. Fourth floor,"" Molly replied.

""To Bill's room. I'll be back in just a moment,"" Remus smiles and leans down to take Harry from Sirius and to give Sirius a soft kiss on the forehead. He smiles again as he leaves the room.

Sirius clears his throat once Remus is gone and stares down at the table for a moment before looking up at Arthur and Molly.

""I'm very sorry about Fabian and Gideon, Mols. I meant to owl after I heard, but there was no time. They were good people,"" Sirius focuses on Molly and watches as her eyes grow sad. ""We lost a lot of good people in this war, a lot of friends and family,"" he looks down at the table again and wrings his hands. ""I'm sure you both are aware that we believed there was a traitor in the Order,"" he looks up and catches their nods. ""Dumbledore and Moody believed that it had to be one of the Marauders, given the information that was leaked to the Death Eaters. It seemed ridiculous at first, but it was war. None of us suspected James or Lily, of course, not when their son was You-Know-Who's target. And no one believed Peter able of betraying his only friends. After Hogwarts, Remus and I moved in together, so we knew each other's movements better than anyone. Remus began to leave for long stretches of time, and he wouldn't tell me where he would go or what he was doing. I grew suspicious, Remus's odd behavior coupled with the knowledge that one of us was the traitor..."" Sirius shakes his head sadly.

""Most of the Order thought the traitor had to be Sirius,"" Remus adds as he reenters the room. ""Like you said Molly, he's a Black."" Molly at least has the decency to look ashamed. ""Dumbledore had me going on secret missions where I would be gone weeks at a time, sometimes months, and it seemed every time I came back home Sirius was more and more closed off from me. With the rumors circulating, I thought the worst,"" Remus's mouth twists into a bitter frown. ""It didn't help that we had a rat whispering doubts into our ears, pitting us against each other so we wouldn't suspect the real culprit."" Remus clenches his fists and breathes deeply. Sirius rests a hand over his and squeezes.

""When James and Lily were forced into hiding, Dumbledore suggested a Fidelis Charm to keep their location secret. James asked me to be his Secret Keeper, but I knew I would be the obvious choice. I was afraid the Death Eaters would force it out of me, so I told them to pick Peter since I didn't trust Remus at the time. I thought no one would think James would pick Peter over his best friend. I thought Peter was a safe choice.""

""On Halloween night Sirius stormed into the apartment, bloody and frantic, rambling about Peter's flat being ransacked and Peter gone. Before I could even begin fixing all of his injuries he had fled the apartment and,"" Remus glances at Arthur, knowing he worked for the Improper Use of Muggle Artifacts Department in the Ministry but figured if he could keep Sirius's whereabouts secret, he keep this one, too, ""got on his flying motorcycle to warn James and Lily."" Remus's grip on Sirius's hand tightens.

""It was still smoking when I got there. The roof over Harry's room had been blown completely off, rubble littered the street. I ran inside,"" Sirius squeezes his eyes shut. ""James was- his body was still by the door. He didn't even have his wand, the stupid prick. I could hear Harry crying in his room, so I ran upstairs. He was in his crib and his head was bleeding. Lily was crumpled in front of the crib and He-Wh- Voldemort,"" he ignores Molly and Arthur's gasps, ""was still lying in front of her, his wand still in his hand."" Sirius's jaw clenches and his grip tightens.

""I sent a Patronus to Dumbledore immediately and followed Sirius there. When I got there, he was arguing with Hagrid, who was sent to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle's house, despite the fact that Sirius was his Godfather and thus had rightful custody of him. Sirius handed me Harry and told me to take care of his bike, then left. Hagrid,"" Remus breathes in sharply, still angry at the half-giant, ""he took Harry away, said I had no legal claim to him and that Dumbledore thought it would be best for him to be with family. As if Sirius and I aren't his family, if not by blood then by bond!""

Sirius rests a gentle hand on Remus's arm and continues their tale, ""I went after Peter. Confronted him. The rat knew I would come after him and had a plan ready. I had only just drawn my wand when Peter cut off his bloody finger and blasted the street to bits. I Apparated away before the Aurors could arrive and fled to an old hideout that I knew Remus would be waiting in.""

""We went after Harry a few days later and Petunia happily handed him over. Petunia and her husband Vernon are the worst kind of Muggles, even by their standards. They didn't want anyone to know their nephew was half-Indian, so they kept him in a cupboard under the stairs. We took him away from them and we've been running pretty much ever since, staying in various Muggle towns and avoiding Wizards as much as we can. Sirius and Harry are far too recognizable, and after the Ministry gave his photo to the Muggle police it's been hard to stay unrecognized. We owled Dumbledore and explained the switch and that we needed a place to hide until we can find somewhere for ourselves. He told us to come to you.""

""We don't mean to impose, but we don't really have a better option. It would only be for a few months, three tops,"" Sirius adds, giving them his best puppy dog eyes, which are, to be fair, very impressive.

""How exactly are we supposed to believe you?"" Molly demands. As she speaks there is a tapping at the kitchen window.

""That should be the owl Dumbledore said he'd send,"" Remus comments, standing from the kitchen table and opening the window. A large grey owl hops onto his arm and Remus takes the letter from its beak, wincing when it nips him. ""Here you go Molly,"" he hands her the letter, ""where do you keep your owl treats? Oh, never mind, I've found them."" He reaches up and takes down a glass container full of small treats from the owl.

Sirius waits in tense silence as Molly and Arthur read over Dumbledore's words, hands twisting together nervously in his lap. When they finally set down the letter he watches them carefully.

""I suppose we could find a spare cot or two,"" Molly acquiesces, sharing a look with Arthur.

Remus and Sirius exchange relieved glances and both of their shoulders finally relax."

 (Or rather, of Hagrid) 

This story starts on a perfectly normal Sunday, on a perfectly normal street, in a perfectly normal house. The particular house in question was nearly imperceptible from the rows upon rows of cookie-cut houses, but we shall begin with the one labeled Number Four.

Within the perfectly normal Number Four lived the equally normal Dursleys. The Dursleys were the sort of people who you'd least expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, simply because they didn't put up with such nonsense.

Vernon Dursley worked at a company called CoreWorth, which made and sold investments. He was a rather large man, and reminded many of an unholy offspring between an elephant seal and a silverback gorilla. Petunia Dursley was a tall woman made of sharp angles and double the normal allowance of a neck (which came in very useful when she decided to peep on the neighbors). The last of the Dursleys was Dudley Dursley, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley's son, whom they believed to be the finest boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, and yet, they had a terrible secret. Their worst fear was the discovery of this secret, of their connection to the Potters. Lily Potter was Petunia's younger sister, but Petunia hadn't had any contact with her as long as she could prevent it. In fact, Mrs. Dursley liked to pretend that she didn't have a sister, because freakish Lily Potter and her freakish husband were as strange and as unnatural and as Un-Dursleyish as it was possible to be.

The Dursleys shuddered to imagine what the neighbors would think if the Potters arrived on the street. For years Petunia had prayed at St. Catherine's Mercy, desperate for misfortune to fall upon her sister and her freakish family to prevent such an act. And of course, what had to happen except Mrs. Dursley's mother to call, elated, with news of Lily's pregnancy.

A new witch in the family, how wonderful! She had said. Petunia had slammed the phone down onto the receiver and pretended that it didn't hurt that her own mother preferred a freak's pregnancy over Petunia's own.

    It wouldn't matter, Petunia had decided, whether her mother loved Lily more; She was fully convinced that the baby would be just as freakish as the Potter seniors, and it served as just another reason for Petunia to keep her family away from them.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke on the perfectly ordinary Sunday where our story starts, there was nothing strange or unnatural about the cloudy, dull sky that could suggest that peculiar things would soon be happening all over the country.

Mrs. Dursley had slipped on a well-used robe that had been a gift from Mr. Dursley, and went to quell the piercing shrieks of her hungry two-year old son. Mr. Dursley simply grumbled and shifted in the queen-size mattress-sag that served as the half of his bed, and went back to sleep. It wouldn't even be till eight-a.m (as Dudley had the nasty habit of waking up at six) that Vernon would be roused by a half-dressed Petunia, and pick out his ugliest tie for Sunday services while Mrs. Dursley gossiped madly away, wrestling with an agitated Dudley.

Unfortunately, or possibly rather fortunately depending on whether or not you were a Dursley, neither Petunia or Vernon seemed to notice the tawny elf owl that was perching precariously outside their window. If they had, then perhaps their day would have gone a bit differently. Perhaps Mrs. Dursley would have shrieked much like her squalling son instead of complaining about the gaudy pearls decorating her neck being fake. Perhaps Mr. Dursley would have insisted upon staying home instead of venturing out as to ensure no more owls or freakish animals appeared near their home. Perhaps if the Dursleys had noticed these things, they would have discarded the small boy they were soon to find on their doorstep, and our story would be going in quite a different direction.

In any case, the Dursleys did not notice the diminutive owl that seemed to glare holes through the two as they each ventured past the bedroom window. Instead, at half-past eight, Mrs. Dursley fought with Dudley's papoose in the car as Mr. Dursley stuck one of many keys into the front doors' keyhole and waddled over to the driver's side. ""Little tyke,"" Mr. Dudley had chortled as Dudley began tantruming, landing a solid thwack! in Petunia's face.

It wasn't until the corner of Privet Drive that Mrs. Dursley noticed the first sign of something unusual. A cat reading a map. At first, Mrs. Dursley couldn't believe her eyes, and jerked her head around to look again. There, on the curb of the street, was a cat, simply sitting. There wasn't a map, let alone a scrap of paper, in sight. What could she have been thinking? She tittered a laugh to herself, gaining an odd look from her husband as they stopped at the stop sign. She stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley began to press again on the peddle and pass the corner to drive up the road Mrs. Dursley watched the cat in the mirror. It was now reading the large stone sign that said Privet Drive--no, it was looking at the sign. Cats couldn't read maps or signs, or anything else for that matter. Mrs. Dursley gently fluffed her coarse hair and put the cat out of her mind, focusing on whether or not she believed Dudley could be old enough to learn anything at Children's Church.

But by the edge of Padstow, where their church was located, Dudley's courses at Children's Church had all but been put out of Petunia's mind. As the Dursleys sat in their usual Sunday morning traffic jam they couldn't help but notice there seemed to be quite a bit of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley began to rave about 'the get-ups you see on young people these days!' as people dressed in anything even slightly unordinary seemed to personally offend him. Mrs. Dursley's face began to pinch with the scowling sneer set up on her face, nodding her head with Vernon's tirade against the 'immigrant influence.' Mr. Dursley began drumming his fingers angrily against the steering wheel as his eyes fell on a huddle of those weirdos standing quite close by. Aliens, they were. He knew. They were whispering excitedly together. 'Probably a terrorist plot,' Mr. Dursley had thought. 

He became especially enraged, so much so that his wife put a hand over his beefy arm in comfort, when he saw that these terrorists weren't young men at all. They were older than Mr. Dursley himself! Wearing ridiculously bright colours; yellows and blues and violets, all with glittering sequins that sparkled with every minimalistic swish (if one with an outfit like that could use a word such as).

Mr. Dursley began to feel the smallest traces of fear roll inside him like the beads of sweat down his temple. Was this some sort of bombing? A distraction? Mrs. Dursley simply cooed at both her husband and her grunting son, assuring them both that it must be part of some silly stunt. Of course! That must be it. A silly stunt. The traffic moved a few minutes later as they arrived into the St. Catherine's parking lot, the elder Dursleys discussing whether it was more beneficial to have Dudley in Children's Church or the Adult's church.

The Dursleys always sat in the fourth row on the isle side because Mr. Dursley worked as an usher (and if a few tithings fell into his pocket during donation, well, that was nobody's business). If he hadn't then perhaps they would had noticed the many owls swooping to and fro past the delicately colored glass windows. As it was, once again, the peculiarity passed them by and went on to be noticed by the passer-bys outside who gazed open-mouthed at the owls that sped overhead. Many of them had never even seen an owl, even at nighttime. Mr., Mrs., and tiny Dudley Dursley, however, had a very normal, owl-free morning. Mr. Dursley pocketed an extra forty-six pounds, Mrs. Dursley gossiped with Mrs. Greer and Mrs. Blanton about Ms. Figg, and Dudley fussed with his seat straps and threw his toys at the people in the row in front. All in all, they were in a very good mood until lunchtime after the first service when they decided to eat out with Vernon's extra pocket money.

They had forgotten all about the freaks in cloaks until they passed by a gaggle of them on the sidewalk next to the Diner. Mr. Dursley eyed them angrily as he and his wife passed by, Mrs. Dursley clutching Dudley's carrier closer to her bust. These freaks made them uneasy. This bunch seemed to be whispering excitedly, too, and Mr. Dursley couldn't spot a single collecting tin these sorts usually carried. It wasn't till they were inside did the Dursleys catch snippets of what was being said by the cloak-clad weirdos infesting the diner (both except Dudley, who was more interested in stealing bites from both his parents' plates). 


""The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard, in Mungo's--""











""Yes, their son Hari--""


Mr. Dursley tripped over a table, nearly sending Petunia sprawling. A waitress rushed over to help him and was knocked away. Mrs. Dursley set Dudley on the table that was uprighted and helped her husband up into a chair. Mr. Dursley began muttering to his wife fearfully, about the you-know-whos and the conversation overhead. Mrs. Dursley simply snipped at him that he was being ridiculous, and that it could be anyone they were speaking about ""with those sorts of people, Vernon. Those people haven't an original thought in their head, let alone names."" Mr. Dursley stroked his mustache and bobbed his head, agreeing. Potter wasn't such an uncommon name, especially for those who stole their way into his good country. He was sure there were several Potters who had a son named Harry, especially those who tried to pass for English. 

Come to think of it, the Dursleys weren't even sure their nephew's name was Harry. It could be Harvey, or Henry, or something just as freakish as they are. Petunia was right; there was no point in worrying (especially when it upset Mrs. Dursley so). He didn't blame her--if he'd had a sister like that.....but all the same, those freaks in cloaks...













They ordered their food from the same flustered waitress whom Mr. Dursley had shoved, and sipped haughtily from their teacups as they arrived. The tray arrived a few minutes later, with Mrs. Dursley's plate of eggs and toast and Mr. Dursley's plates of pancakes, eggs, sausage, and bacon. It took sparingly few minutes before Vernon was finished with his food and Dudley began to squall. His ear piercing cries were ignored by his parents, who left the other patrons to suffer, as Petunia finished her plate and called for the bill.













As they left with the hysterical Dudley in tow, much to the relief of the remaining diners and staff, Mr. Dursley nearly felled a stranger who slammed into him.













""Sorry,"" he grunted, as the tiny man stumbled back. It was a few moments before Mr. Dursley realized the tiny brown man was wearing a glimmering violet cloak. He didn't seem upset at all being nearly knocked to the ground, or by the sour look upon Mr. Dursley's face directed at him. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a (to Mr. Dursley's ears) heavily accented, squeaky voice, ""Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy, happy day!""













Petunia violently flinched, and the man had the audacity to hug Mr. Dursley so hard around the middle his nose dug into Mr. Dursley's large stomach.













Mr. Dursley stood frozen in place. He had just been hugged by this--this freak. He also thought he has been called a 'muggle', whatever that was.













'Even if they don't  belong here, still, can't you learn the damn language of the blasted country you're contaminating?' He had thought viciously. 













As the Dursleys pulled past the gates to Privet Drive and back into the driveway of Number Four the first thing Mrs. Dursley saw was the tabby cat she'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on the garden wall corner of Number Four and Number Three. She was sure it was the same one; it was the same silvery-grey colour with black markings around its eyes. Its long, fluffy tail flicked back and forth sharply and it seemed to glare at them as they got out of the car.













""Shoo!"" Mrs. Dursley shrieked, swatting in its direction with the hand not wrapped around Dudley's baby-seat.













The cat didn't move. If anything, its tufted ears laid horizontally from its head and its eyes slid to stern slits. Huffing and trying to pull herself together, Mrs. Dursley followed her husband into the house. She was determined not to let any of this get to her. 













The time at back at their home through dinner was fairly normal. Mr. Dursley spoke about his new investments and how he was expecting a raise quite soon. Mrs. Dursley relayed the gossip learned from Mrs. Greer and Blanton, especially about how Mr. Number Sixteen's wife was apparently leaving him for a younger man. After dinner, when Dudley had been put to bed Mr. and Mrs. Dursley went into the living room to catch the last report on the evening news:













""And finally, bird-watchers everywhere are astounded by the nation's owls' activity today. Owls, who are nocturnal predators, have been seen flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why these birds have suddenly changed their instinctual patterns."" The newscaster plastered a strained grin on his face. ""And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?""













""Well, Ted,"" said the weatherman, ""I don't know about that, but it's not just birds that have been acting batty lately. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a shower of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night a bit early--it's only a few days away folks! But I can promise a wet one tonight.""













Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair, while Mrs. Dursley sat with her long fingernails clutching gouges in the couch cushions. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks invading all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about Potters...













He could feel his forehead flushing and moistening, and knew it was no good. He would have to ask. He cleared his throat nervously.













""Er--Tuney, darling--you haven't heard from your sister lately have you?""













As expected, her gaze snapped over to him, shocked and angry. The teacup currently lying in pieces on the carpet that had been dangling from her hands was a surprise, though. After all, they usually pretended she didn't have a sister.













""No. I haven't even spoken to Mother,"" she said sharply. ""Why?""













""Funny stuff on the news,"" Mr. Dursley mumbled, pointing a round finger vaguely in its direction, ""Owls.....shooting stars... and those people we saw in town today--""













""So?"" snapped Mrs. Dursley.













""Well, I just thought.....maybe.....it was something to do with.....you know.....her crowd."" 













Mrs. Dursley looked like Mr. Dursley had just killed her favourite cat (as if he could do such a thing, since Petunia hated animals), sitting rigidly on the puce coloured couch, breathing hotly through her nose.













He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. However, while Mr. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mrs. Dursley crept to the large bedroom window and peered out to the front garden. The cat was still there. It was now staring down Privet Drive as if waiting for something.













Was she imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with her? If it did.....if it got out that they were related to a--well she didn't think she could bear it.













The Dursleys got into bed. Mr. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mrs. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in her mind. Her last, comforting thought before she fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near her and Mr. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what she and Vernon thought about them and their kind.....she couldn't see how she and Vernon could get mixed up in anything that might be going on--she yawned and turned over--it couldn't affect them...













How very wrong she was.







Mrs. Dursley  might have been drifting off into an easy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no signs of weariness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the entrance corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a dog began barking madly, nor when a small elf owl swooped down and perched on the raised square across from the cat itself. The owl copied the cat's almost lifeless stance and it was nearly midnight before either of them moved.













A man appeared on the corner the animals had been watching, so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed, while the owl's feathers ruffled and it gave a small ""Hoo.""













Nothing like this man had even been seen on Privet Drive, even on Hallow's Eve. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt (that luckily he refrained from). He was wearing long maroon robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was nearly as thin as he was, as well as long and crooked. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.













Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize, or perhaps was simply unbothered, by the fact that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging through the many pockets of his cloak, looking for something. He did seem to realize he was being watched though, as he looked up from his pockets to the cat and from the cat to the owl. For some reason, this seemed to amuse him. He chuckled to himself and muttered, ""I should have known.""













He has seemed to of found what he was looking for as he fished out what seemed to be an intricate, long, silver cigarette lighter. He held it up near his head, and clicked it. The nearest lantern-style street light went out with a muted pop. He clicked it again--another near dozen times--till the nearest eleven street lights were out and the entrance to Privet Drive was shrouded in darkness; the only light being the pinpricks of yellow from an irritant cat's and a curious owl's eyes. He seemed to be satisfied that no one would be able to peep outside their windows onto them, and slipped the strange device back into one of his many pockets.













""Fancy seeing you here, Professors."" he greeted as he sat down on a decorative rock in the road verge. The cat hopped down and strut quickly over to him, as the owl flew strangely skillfully to perch near the strange man.













Before the cat reached him, it morphed into a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing oval spectacles exactly the shape the markings the cat had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her salt-and-peppered hair was drawn into a tight bun, and she looked distinctly ruffled.













""How did you know it was me?"" she asked.













""My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.""













""You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day."" Professor McGonagall sniffed.













""Oh, Minerva! You should have been more inconspicuous."" came a squeaky voice.













A small man, no larger than a six-year old child, was standing next to Albus, all traces of the owl gone. He was wearing a tea coloured conductor-like suit with a yellow half-cape. He had a short mustache and what could be considered a bowl-like haircut.













""Professor Flitwick, I would have thought you'd be celebrating, I must have past at least a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.""













Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily at Dumbledore's insinuation, while Flitwick looked morose.













""Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,"" she said impatiently. ""You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no--even the Muggles have noticed something is going on.""













""Yes, it was on their news,"" Flitwick nodded. ""Flocks of owls, shooting stars.....well they aren't completely oblivious. Shooting stars down in Kent! I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."" he huffed out his nose. 













""You can't blame them,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""We've had precious little to celebrate for a dozen years.""













""But that's no reason to lose our heads,"" McGonagall said irritably. ""People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.""













She threw a sharp glance at Dumbledore, as if she expected him to tell her something, but he didn't and was interrupted before she could start again.













""A fine thing it'd be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all."" Flitwick grinned, his short mustache coming up to tickle his nose (which produced a rather high pitched sneeze).













""So, I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?"" the stern McGonagall seemed almost unsure of herself, which was a very odd and unnatural look upon such a woman.













""It certainly seems so,"" said Dumbledore. ""We have much to be thankful for. Would you like a lemon drop?""













""A what?""













""A lemon drop. They're a type of Muggle sweet I'm fond of.""













""No thank you,"" said McGonagall coldly, as if she didn't think this was quite the time for the talk of lemon drops.













""I'll have one Albus!"" Flitwick raised his arm and outstretched rather long fingers for someone of such a short stature.













""As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone--""













""My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You-Know-Who' nonsense--for years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort."" Both Professors flinched, though Flitwick's reaction was slightly more comical due to the sour candy in his mouth. ""It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who'. We'd get them all switched,"" he continued, unsticking two lemon drops and pretending not to notice their reactions, ""I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name than any of the others.""













""I know you haven't,"" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. ""But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know-Who--oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.""













""You flatter me,"" said Dumbledore calmly, ""Voldemort had powers I will never have.""













""Half of the You-Know-Who's have! It's only because you're too noble to use them."" said Flitwick.













""It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.""













Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, ""The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?""













""Minerva--"" Flitwick tried to reach out for her, but stopped as she pierced him with a fierce stare.













 It seemed that she had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat or as a woman had she fixed either of her companions with such a look as she was trading between them. Dumbledore, however, chose not to answer. Instead, he was choosing another lemon drop.













""What they're saying,"" she pressed on, ""is that last night Voldemort turned up in Saint Mungo's. He went to find the Potters and the Longbottoms. The rumor is that Lily and James, and Alice are--are--that they're--dead.""













Dumbledore bowed his head. Flitwick laid his head along McGonagall's robes and pat her back. McGonagall gasped.













""Lily and James.....I can't believe it.....I didn't want to believe it.....Oh poor Frank...""













Shining tears slid down her face as Dumbledore reached out and patted her shoulder. ""I know.....I know..."" he said heavily.













Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. ""That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Longbottom boy, Neville, and the Potter boy, Hari. But--he couldn't. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill the first boy, Neville Longbottom, Voldemort's power somehow broke, and that's why he's gone.""













Dumbledore nodded glumly.







""It's--It's true?"" faltered Professor McGonagall. ""After all he's done.....all the people he's killed.....he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding.....of all the things to stop him.....but how in the name of Circe did Neville survive? And what of the Potter boy, Hari? How did Neville possibly save himself, let alone another child?""













""We can only guess,"" said Dumbledore. ""We may never know.""







Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles, leaning on Professor Flitwick as much as she could. Flitwick rubbed what of her back he could reach soothingly, murmuring soft words. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden pocket watch from one of his pockets and examined it. It was a very odd watch, with twelve hands pointing at planets instead of numbers that moved around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, as in any case he placed it back in a pocket and said ""Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way.""













""I followed Filius, whom Hagrid told,"" she sniffed. ""And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here of all places?""













""I've come to bring Hari to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.""













Both Flitwick and McGonagall protested at once.













""You don't mean--you can't mean the people who live here?""













""Dumbledore--you can't. I've been watching this house all day--""













""And I've followed them!""







""--You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son--I saw him kicking all the way up the street, screaming for sweets!""













""And what about his skin? These people are even more bigoted than the Morden family!""













Flitwick ended with a huff, while McGonagall gestured her hands to him, nodding vigorously. 













""It's the best place for him,"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.""













""A letter?"" repeated Flitwick faintly, while McGonagall muttered something that sounded suspiciously like ""Oh goody.""













""Really Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous! A legend brother to Neville! I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Miracle Boy Day in the future--there will be books written of them--every child in our world will know their names!""













""Exactly,"" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. ""It would be enough to turn any boy's head. In another's shadow before he can walk and talk! Half-famous for something he can't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?""













Flitwick opened his mouth, changed his mind, and swallowed, leaving McGonagall to intervene. ""Yes--yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting here?"" She eyed his cloak as if he might be hiding Hari underneath the folds.













""Hagrid's bringing him.""













""You think it--wise--to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"" Flitwick's nose crinkled unsurely.













""I would trust Hagrid with my life,"" said Dumbledore.













""I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,"" Flitwick said grudgingly, ""but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to--what was that?""













A loud rumbling sound had broken the silence surrounding them. It grew steadily louder as McGonagall and Flitwick looked up and down the street for signs of a headlight with Dumbledore smiling fondly; it swelled to a roar as they all looked up at the sky--and a huge motorcycle seemed to fall out of the air and land on the street in front of them.













If the motorcycle was large, it was nothing compared to the man sitting astride it. He was nearly twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild--long tangles of bushy brown hair and beard his most of his face, his hands were the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather-looking boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of multi-coloured blankets.










""Hagrid,"" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. ""At last. And where did you get the motorcycle?""




















""Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,"" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. ""Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.""

















""No problems, were there?""

















""No, sir--hospital was mostly destroyed, but I got 'im out 'fore folks starting swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.""

















Hagrid held his arms low, so that Flitwick could see when McGonagall and Dumbledore bent over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of wild, jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

















""Dumbledore, what is that?"" whispered Professor McGonagall.

















""A backlash from Neville's magic. The poor boy's face is near half scarred. He'll have it for the rest of his life. They both will.""

















""Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"" questioned Flitwick.

















""Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well--give him here, Hagrid--we'd better get this over with.""

















Dumbledore took Hari in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.

















""Could I--could I say good-bye to 'im, sir?"" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over and gave Hari what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss, as the babe began to wrinkle his face up. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

















""Shhh!"" hissed Professor Flitwick, putting a long, bony finger up to his mouth.

















""You'll wake the Muggles, Rubeus!"" Professor McGonagall laid a comforting arm on the large man, trying to hush him.

















""S-s-sorry,"" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a very large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. ""But I c-c-can't stand it--Lily an' James dead--and poor little Hari off ter live with Muggles--""

















""Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,"" Professor Flitwick whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore flicked his wrist towards a wrought-iron gate and stepped through, following the pathway to the front door. He shifted the boy in his arms and bent over, placing one of the old milk bottles in front of the door just in the center of the doormat. A flick of his wrist and a slim piece of wood fell into his fingers. A whispered word, and a milk bottle morphed into a small wicker basket with a purple pillow inside. He laid the babe onto the pillow and reached into his pocket, placing the letter he found there in plain view. Another flick of his wand, another word, ensured that the letter would stick.

















He walked back to the trio, where one by one they took turns placing enchantments on the boy. McGonagall made sure the boy would stay protected from any animals that happened to lurk nearby, with a small crystalline dome that shone if you looked at it just right. Flitwick magicked small charms that looked to be fireflies, ensuring the boy would stay warm throughout the night (due to Hagrid's request, as he was not legally allowed to do magic), and a small, modified notice-me-not charm. Hagrid gave one last, not so small good-bye, and stuffed a clean handkerchief around the boy's sides, and then returned to the corner.

















For a full minute the four of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, McGonagall blinked furiously, Flitwick stifled sniffles, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes had seemed to of gone out.

















""Well,"" said Dumbledore finally, ""that's that."" We've no business staying here, We may as well go and join the celebrations.""

















""Yeah,"" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, ""I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall--Professor Flitwick--Professor Dumbledore, sir.""

















Wiping his eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.

















""I shall see you soon, I expect, Professors,"" said Dumbledore, nodding to the remaining duo. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply, while Professor Flitwick nodded mutely.

















Dumbledore stood and walked back down the street. On the corner he took out the strange cigarette-lighter looking device. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back into their street lamps just suddenly enough he could make out a strange cat slinking around the corner. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of Number Four.

















""Good luck, Hari,"" he murmured, as an elf owl swooped overhead. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.

















A breeze ruffled the flora of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy underneath the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Hari Potter rolled over in his blankets, one hand clutching at the unmoving letter. He would sleep on, not knowing he was famous, not knowing was special, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours by the horrified shrieks of one Mrs.Dursley. He couldn't know that at this very moment, one Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, had signed Hari's fate in a life of hell.

Echo of a Memory


(Or rather, a Song)


He had been having the dream again. The one of darkness with a soft humming from a lady he didn't know, following the tinkling notes that came from above. The one where he was wrapped tightly. Warmly. Safely. And then he was picked up by large, soft hands that held him close and whispered, ""We love you, Hari."" The one that caused him to forget himself and sing softly in the bathroom when he thought Ms. Petunia was in the other room, resulting in a sharp smack that had his head cracking against the hard bathtub.

Hari was four now, not that he knew that. The Dursleys seldom let him know the time of the day, let alone which number it was on the calendar (as if they would have told him anyway). He was a smart boy, and sometimes, very privately, almost proud of himself. He knew how to make the coffee and breakfast, how to scrub the tiles and the granite of the house till it shone, and how to do most of the laundry all by himself.

These were things that made the Dursleys happy. Things that didn't get him in trouble. He had learned the hard way what happened when he didn't do his chores right, or if he didn't finish them in time. He still had a large scar on his left leg where the Dursleys allowed Dudley to see how many times Hari could be pushed down the stairs before he stopped getting up.

Now he sat in his small room, a cupboard, to be precise, pushing the pain away from his most recent punishment. He didn't know the difference between a cupboard and a proper room, since it was the only thing he could ever remember staying in.

'Liar,' a voice whispered in the back of his mind. His dream. He could remember being held by something large and soft, like the baby-bed he was learning to make up for the baby Petunia was going to have soon.

 'But it was a dream and dreams are nonsense and nonsense gets me punished,' Hari told the voice fervently. 

Nonsense did get Hari punished, especially when it was Hari's special sort of nonsense. The first time, he had been reprimanded because he dropped a plate. His face had stung awfully, and his nose began to bleed all over the carpet. He knew the bleeding would mean more punishment, since it was him who made the mess, until the blood was just--gone. Gone from his face, the carpet, the scraps he wore as clothes--it was all gone. 

That night Hari had his first ever broken bone, if you didn't count his nose, as punishment for his special nonsense.

And now, he was arguing with a voice in his head that suggested he use his special thing to fix his arm. Hari was curled protectively around it atop a worn dishmat over the floor, whimpering quietly. 

It was another thing he had almost mastered: silence. Whether it was creeping around at night to steal drinks of water his companion had convinced him they needed, or crying in his cupboard as to not wake the Dursleys.

His companion had also been teaching him something else in the silence. He called it magic. It was how he opened the outside locks from the inside of his cupboard and made sure not even Ms. Petunia could find fault in his cleaning.













His voice was trying to teach him how to use magic to fix his arm. Hari had tried, but it only made it glow slightly before the pain faded for a few hours. It came back in full force when he was thrown in his room because of his singing.













 'Try again,' his companion hissed. His voice was, Hari imagined, like the snakes he would spy on the telly sometimes. 'Imagine your arm whole again. Fill it with your magic.' 













Hari tried again. He thought about being able to move his arm, being pain-free, being as close as he could be to healthy again. He didn't even get a glow this time.













 'I don't know how!'  













He imagined his companion rearing up like a snake and hissing. He wasn't angry, not at Hari. Hari could tell. He could feel his companion sliding around in his head, as if he was looking for something. Hari didn't know what he could be looking for, since Companion seemed to be a lot smarter than Hari was.













 'Feel it. In the air. It's thick, like cloth. Imagine it as a colour. Give it essence--it isn't inanimate.'













Hari didn't quite know what inanimate meant, but he did as told to the best of his abilities. He closed his eyes and tried to imagine his magic around him. He knew what it felt like due to the precious few times he had been able to use it, and almost flinched when he felt a massive presence draping across him. It felt dark green, like a lizard! He giggled quietly to himself and felt soft, affectionate pats in his mind at his observation. It stretched to the entirety of his room, yet seemed suffocated, as if it was containing itself.













 '.....it's big.' Hari marvelled to Companion.













'Yes,' Companion sounded strange. 'You will only grow stronger. But for now, you must learn how to use it. Imagine your magic filling your arm and making it white.' 













 'White? Is brown bad?' Hari looked at his arms self-consciously. He didn't know what to do if Companion thought he was ugly too.













'Not like that, young one. White light. Like....a lightbulb.' His companion didn't seem to like lightbulbs, the way he sneered its' name. Hari was surprised and fell against the crude wall when he suddenly saw pictures before his eyes, like a vivid telly in his head. 













He took calming, silencing breaths before he copied the pictures that had been pushed to the forefront of his mind. He gathered small bits of his magic that he knew how to handle and pushed it through his fingertips. He imagined a sort of wall stopping it at his elbow, so that his magic could fill up his arm until it reached his wrist. Then he made it turn white.














'Now repeat after me: Therapavo.'














"":Therapavo.:"" He didn't even notice he wasn't speaking english; he was too distracted by his arm being jerked back into place and a sharp snap that echoed off the splintered walls. His eyes saw pitch black for a moment before all the pain radiating from his arm was gone. 













 'It's.....it's fixed,' as if Hari couldn't believe it himself.













 'I told you that you could do it. Do not doubt me again.' His companion sounded both irritated and smug. 'Now, you need food.' 













Hari could feel what he could only think of as heavily huffs of breath inside his head, as if his Companion had just ran away from Mr. Vernon's sister, Mrs. Nelson's, dog Razor.













 'I just made dinner. I have to wait until tomorrow....Are you okay?' 













'I am--tired,' Companion said carefully. 'It takes a lot of my magic to show you things.'









'So it's hard?'









'It is not--hard!' Hari's companion sounded offended. He shifted inside the boy's mind slowly. 'It is irrelevant. You need food or you will become weak. If you become weak you will die, and I will not allow that.'













Hari felt something he hadn't ever felt before. Someone cared for him. He didn't know precisely why, or realize that if he died then so would his companion (and perhaps that was the reason he mentored Hari so), Hari just knew that someone cared if he didn't live anymore. He felt a metaphorical bond form between himself and his companion as he hissed the magic word Alohomora and crept out of his room.













He peeked around the corner of the stairs and listened very carefully for breathing. He could hear the telly going in the living room being muffled by Dudley's loud laughter. Petunia would be on bedrest now after each meal, and Vernon was away at work. Hari slid around the corner and tiptoed across the large, open hall that served as a midway from the living room, the dining room, and his goal: the kitchen.













He dove for the island cabinets and braced himself against the back of it as heavy footsteps thudded towards the fridge. Hari was hiding under the lid of the cabinet as Dudley ransacked through the refrigerator.













'This is your chance!' His companion's voice rang out through his mind.













'Now? Dudley is right there!' 













 'No. Take something when he leaves and let the pig take the blame.' 













Hari could feel him slinking around, as if preparing to strike out. He was sluggish though, in his voice and the mental impressions that Hari imagined as movements, and it worried Hari. He swore he would never make his Companion do that again. He would try harder, do better. For him.













When Dudley left, taking half the supply of Petunia's rice puddings, Hari made his move. He shot out like a snake and shoved his fingers between the door before it could close, ignoring the pain that blossomed at his fingertips. He cracked open the door and slipped his arm inside, pawing for the pudding cups. His fingers grazed the foil covering and he snatched it, pulling his arm back and gently shut the door, careful not to make too much noise.













He felt nothing but freedom rushing back to his cupboard, ripping the tinfoil off of his prize. He made sure to whisper Straiga to seal his door in between cherished bites of food from his fingers. He felt nothing but elation at his newfound trick, and praised his companion, who was silent the rest of the night. Hari left a bit of his treat for the Huntsman spiders that kept him company, shoving the cheap, plastic cup in the furthest webbed corner before curling on his dishrag and falling asleep.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

He had been caught. He had tried his trick of stealing food again, only Vernon had come home early. He had walked in on Hari nicking a can of soup from the pantry. He had wrenched the can away from Hari and the next thing he knew was a sharp, exploding pain across his temple. He had been knocked to the floor, with it pressed up against his cheek as he felt liquid drip down over his brow. His relief was small, only as long as it took Vernon to fall to his knees and bring his arm above his own head for another strike. All Hari knew afterwards were the bruising strikes against him, more often than not leaving small slices along his body. It seemed to last hours each time he was hit, and seconds between each respite, until the can burst against his body and he was coated in nearly-expired tomato soup.













""Clean it up, fucking sand nigger,"" He hissed.













Tears leaked out of Hari's eyes, and he allowed himself small, noisy sniffs before pushing himself up on his left side, careful of the stinging cuts littering his right. He didn't know what those words meant, but he knew Vernon called him that a lot.













'Everything hurts,' he cried, even inside his head.













'If I could, I would kill him,' Companion promised.













 'That's not nice,' he reprimanded softly, even as black fireworks exploded behind his eyes when he put any weight on his right sight. He winced back onto his left side, using his dominant hand to lean on and pick up the abandoned can with the other.














'And look at what they've done to you! Filthy muggles.' 














Hari ignored the ranting of his companion, and the numerous ways that his companion promised their deaths. He couldn't comprehend most of them anyway. Instead, he grit his teeth and heaved himself off of the floor using the cabinets as leverage. He limped to the trash bin and dropped the soup tin inside. He shut the cabinet door that held the bin and fetched a rag from the drawers. He wet it and began his trek back to his mess.













His companion was silent by the time Hari began scrubbing the floor. Instead of words, Hari felt a magic different than his own (the sparingly few times he had used it) flow through his body. It felt dark; like boiling blood. It coiled around his right side and he could feel it stinging as it weaved between his muscles and bones. 













It was odd and unpleasant and he hated it, but he trusted his companion. He could feel the right side of his ribcage constricting, shortening his breath and increasing his heart rate. He had stopped scrubbing the mess and was bracing himself in the puddle. It was of no use when the full force hit.













After the magic had braided through his body, the stinging began to increase until it felt like his entire right side was on pins and needles. Then everything seemed to explode. Hari couldn't even scream as it felt like half of him was being burned alive from the inside. He collapsed in the puddle on the brink of forced consciousness, his mind filled with static and random thoughts he knew weren't his own.














'Muggles. Magic. Hogwarts. Safety.'














Knowledge from his companion had blended with his own. He knew more, felt more, saw more, was more. He rose into a kneeling position on the floor, distantly fascinated that he was no longer in pain. He flexed his right hand, which felt static-like and strangely still, but proper.













He scrubbed the rest of the mess absently, venturing back and forth from the sink to the puddle on shaky legs. He noticed the mess had gotten noticeably bigger and more diluted. He decidedly did not think about how that came to be, And set about finishing his chore.













Once the mess was gone, he limped to the laundry room and dropped the dirty rag inside the sink there. He knew he would be expected to be in his cupboard, so that was his next destination.













    'What is Hogwarts?' Hari asked, even though he felt parts of him already knew.













'It's a school. Away from Muggles.' Companion sniffed as if Hari should know this already, as if he expected him to know it. It was ignored by both parties how exhausted he sounded.














'What even is a Muggle?'














His companion shifted slowly in his mind. Hari could feel his magic pressing on different places in his mind as he almost seemed to pace, or shrug.













'It is what they are. Useless. Magicless. Less in everything. Stupid.' But even he sounded somewhat unsure of himself, as if repeating something he had heard.













Hari didn't seem very sure of that explanation. After all--Ms. Petunia had gone to college and she always told him that he'd never be able to go. Mr. Vernon had a very nice job, and always told him that he'd be lucky if the Dursleys kept him around after he turned 18. And Dudley went to school! A lot of kids that looked the size Hari was went to school, and Hari himself didn't, so he must not be very smart.













Hari suddenly felt very self conscious. He had thought because he knew how to do things that Dudley couldn't do that he must have been terribly smart. He hadn't considered that Dudley knew how to do things that Hari didn't...













    He rubbed his arms and winced at the muted pain that ran through where he touched. He scoot over to the cracks in the door and held his arm up to the light. There were faint, purpling marks mottling his skin. He knew from experience that they would only get darker and icky looking, and take longer to heal.














'Why aren't the purples gone?'














'I fear if I healed your bruises the great oaf would beat you more.' His companion sounded apologetic. Hari didn't know why, he wasn't the one who hurt Hari.













Either way, Hari curled up onto his dishrag that currently served as a mattress, and tried to go to sleep.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

His dream was strange.....almost not like a dream at all. He was in darkness, aware, and for a moment he thought that he was having the song dream again. But instead of the motherly humming he expected, there was soft laughter that was definitely male.













Laughter that sounded vaguely familiar in his fogged mind. Laughter that became very familiar when he felt what was like thick, silk smoke brush up against his body and wrap around him.













'Hari...' He whispered, and Hari could have cried. It was the closest thing he'd ever had to a hug.













'I'm here,' he called out desperately, afraid Companion wouldn't be able to hear him. In return, he was completely enveloped in the smoke. It was suffocatingly thick, but Hari knew he would be okay. Companion would never hurt him.














'How are you in my dream?'














The smoke seemed to vibrate with the rich laughter that returned.














'It is not a dream, Hari, we are inside your mind. I am here because you have allowed us to merge.'














'Why do you keep calling me that?' Hari asked. He didn't know his own name, he was always one of those words that the Dursleys called him.














'Calling you what?'















'Hari.'














The smoke stilled for a moment, soft brushes against his skin that Hari imagined should feel like when Ms. Petunia held Dudley.














'Hari is your name.'














Hari fell back on what he thought served as the floor. It looked just as dark as the rest of the place, and for a moment he was scared he'd fall through. His companion began squeezing him reassuringly. Never long enough to hurt, just varying enough to comfort the small boy.














'My name? Harry?'















'No. Hari. It's Indian, like your father.'














'My father was a no-good, unemployed raghead who knocked up my mother and forced her to marry him.' Hari recited. It was what he was taught every time he asked. And every time he didn't, really.













'Do not say those words,' Companion's smoke became thinner than high-mountain air. Hari could imagine needle-sharp spines rippling from his edges. 'Those are ugly words. Ugly words for ugly people. Just like a Muggle to use them.'













'Why does he use them then?' Hari interrupted Companion's rather long-winded tirade about the 'contamination of Muggles'. He sucked in happy, heavy breaths when his companion's smoke thickened again as he calmed.













'He thinks himself superior because of his skin. A rather stupid ideology if you ask me, since most of what he is lounging in and about was created by his dreaded foreigners.' His last words sounded like when Petunia talked to Hari; dull and as if he thought the words themselves were rather stupid. His smoke was still agitated, but not so much as before.













'So he uses those words like you use Muggle?' Hari asked. It seemed like a valid comparison--his companion's tone sounded just like Vernon's when he used those words.













His companion grew very still, as if contemplating. He began various audacious sentences that started with things such as 'Well,' 'I--','No,' 'You're only a child so,' but finally settled with an answer after a few sullen minutes.













'Yes. I suppose he does, and I suppose I do.' And then he was quiet for very long moments. They decided to share the silence together. Until Hari had more questions.














'You said you're here 'cause we merged?'















'Yes.' 















'What does that mean?'















'Your magic allowed me to.....use my magic in your body. Our magics are not compatible, which is why the process is not easy and, regrettably, painful. Over time our magics should become more similar and this should cease to be a problem. I could access my magic at will, and perhaps, so could you.'















'So your colour will become green instead of red?'














'My magic is--red?' This seemed to surprise his companion, as he was silent for several moments even with mental proddings from Hari.














'Yes--is that bad?'














'No. Simply.....interesting. It use to be black.'  The smoke hummed around him and seemed to glow, then it seemed to erupt in reverse as if trying to look at itself. Sure enough, under the rusted-dust colour of his companion were bright, lightning-like streaks of deep red that crackled noiselessly through him.














'How fascinating...'














Hari felt what he could only describe as a snake tongue flicking out around and through the cloud. This greatly confused him, but it gave him an image that made him laugh.













He imagined his companion as a great big snake--brown and green all over with a black belly. Oh how badly it would scare Ms. Petunia!













As soon as he thought it and began to giggle, he noticed that the smoke was lessening. It seemed to be disappearing into nowhere, and Hari felt himself become very scared.













Before his eyes a great snake began to appear on the--floor?--in front of his feet. It didn't look like how he imagined it, per se; more like the snakes he stole glimpses of on the telly in South America that hissed about how ugly the camera people were. But instead of shades of brown and greens, this snake was deep reds and shadowy blacks. It did have a black belly, so Hari had to give it some credit.













'Um, hello,'  greeted Hari. He was admittedly scared without his companion, but the snakes in the garden seemed nice enough so maybe this one was too?













The snake seemed amazed. It's grey-blue eyes were nearly twice the size they were supposed to be, open in shock. It gave an experimental wiggle and shot out its tongue a few times. Then, it hissed in absolute pleasure.














'I haven't had a body in years.'














Hari was bewildered by the voice that emanated from the snake. It sounded just like--














'You're my companion!?'














'Your companion? Now where did you learn a word like that?' The snake seemed to laugh at him, if the short, syllabic hisses were anything to go by.













Hari suddenly seemed very shy of himself.













'The telly...' he tried.













The snake seemed to relent and slithered up to him. It took a few moments before it was able to figure out how to 'stand' alongside Hari and drape itself across his shoulders.













'I am indeed your.....companion,' It--he seemed amused by Hari, so greatly so that he gave a small jerk of his body as he laughed and flicked his tongue against the boy's face.













'Well that--that's good then. It's good then.' Hari paused for a moment. 'You said you didn't have a body before, but you do now, why?'













'I am because you wish it. Your magic allowed me to form. You wished it, and so it happened, as I am a part of you now.' He thought for a bit before continuing, 'If your magic had tried to force me into a body that was incompatible, it would have been painful for the both of us. In a sense, I am because you wish it and because it can be.'













'So.....if I had tried to make you something else it wouldn't have worked?'  It was hard to form the questions he was trying to ask, but he knew imagining his companion as anything other than a snake seemed wrong.














'Most likely, yes. In our world, Magia are able to shift into our animal counterparts, known as our Animagus. It is a combination name of Animal and Magia, as we are our animal selves, yet we keep our minds and for some, our abilities. A snake was my chosen Animagi, therefore we were extremely fortunate.'















'Mageea?'















'Magia. It is the collective term for witches, wizards, and other sorts of sorcerers. Magic people.'














'And they can all turn into animals?' Hari became very excited; if he could turn into an animal maybe he could get more food!














'No. It takes dedicated Magia with a strong magical core. It takes many years to become one, after the years of finding out if you even can. One must have the basics of several magical subjects, at the very least.














Hari felt his hope deflate and pop like a balloon Dudley had discarded. He dared himself to pick up the pieces and ask one more question:














'Would you teach me?'














The snake around his shoulders coiled around him and curled to face him directly.














'Teach you what?'















'Everything.'














The snake gave a hissing laugh and nodded. Hari yawned into his hand and smiled at him. His companion was the last thing he saw before he drifted off into unconsciousness.

The whole ""dreaded foreigners"" thing is supposed to be sarcastic, and that's how I imagine the description of sarcasm.

Cross Your Fingers


(Or rather, Broken Promises)


Hari's companion held true to his word. He did, in a sense, attempt to teach Hari everything.

Companion had been teaching Hari many things other than magic. He had taught Hari how to tell time on the clock in the living room, how to count and do basic math, and even read. 

Reading was something Hari treasured almost as much as magic. He had been working on merging; his and companion's magic (which was now a very deep marooning purple that continued to fascinate him) and Companion could show him books. He could only show a few pages at a time with the rate that Hari read, as keeping up such a complex image tired him out quicker. 









Though the merging process was having a reverse effect, according to Companion, it seemed to be more desirable as his energy levels raised faster. His mental snake body grew bigger as he grew stronger, and he could keep up more complicated images (like books for Hari) in Hari's mind's eye. 









He had also taught Hari something very important besides the bare essential educations. So personal, and so very happy, that Hari had believed someone like himself wasn't allowed to have. 









Companion had taught Hari his birthday. 









It was currently December of 1985, but Hari's birthday was in July. He had turned five years old, celebrated in his cupboard with the spiders and his companion, who decided to give Hari the gift of books. 









It was the kindest thing Companion had ever done for him--it was the kindest thing anyone had done for him--and because of it, Hari treasured reading almost as much as he treasured magic (after all, if he didn't have magic then he wouldn't have his companion). 









Besides his lessons, they had been practicing magic for months now. Hari could make things float and duplicate items long enough to ward off suspicion of him stealing them. He had learned to wait until the dead of night to steal food now, and never risked it in the morning. 









He still ravaged the scraps of Dudley's food that Petunia would pass on to him after he had left for school; it usually consisted of mushy, dissolving cereal in milk that Hari was half sure Dudley spit in just for the heck of it, or the burnt or undercooked pieces of eggs and bacon they would feed him in the hopes he would get sick. It made him want to vomit, but he knew he couldn't stay alive with his night-nicking. He couldn't hoard food without being caught. He had tried, and the result was being beaten so badly he passed out. 









His companion had refused to heal him. Rather, he had walked Hari through the process of stopping internal bleeding and repairing organs Hari didn't know the name of, but did take away pain when Hari healed the bones himself. Since then, Hari had not tried to hoard food, and only snuck out when he was so hungry he felt nauseated. 









Food was his lifeline, but magic was his salvation. He could purify the contents in his stomach, repair and thicken his rag and clothes, and stave off dehydration and starvation for far longer than he suspected would of killed other children. He thanked whatever was out there constantly for giving him magic, much to his companion's approval. 









He would be locked in the cupboard all day today, since the baby was coming. It was his fault, after all. Petunia had been so worked up learning that he had been stealing her food that all of the sudden there was a massive wet spot on the carpet under her legs as she was screaming at him. 









She had braced herself against the archway across from the cupboard, screaming at Vernon and cursing the day Hari was born. She had glared at Hari and threatened that if anything happened to their baby that she would kill him. Hari believed her. 









And so he sat in his cupboard hugging his too-small knees to his chest, rocking back and force, crying silently. 









His companion tried to soothe him, telling him to 'slip back into your mind,' whatever that meant, but Hari just brushed him off and imagined that he had killed someone and it was all his fault. He cried harder thinking about an innocent baby that could have grown up to love him, just maybe. 









He sat that way for hours, not allowing himself the release of sleep. He wanted to punish himself--he deserved it.  He could hear the dying roar of the engine pulling into the garage. It was either his saving grace or the warrant of his death. 









He heard the thundering steps of Dudley, squalling because he didn't want a sister! Hari felt tears run down his face that he thought had long dried out. He was saved! For today, at the very least. 









He listened fervently for any information he could, pressing his face against the door of his room. He could feel the unfinished wood digging into the skin of his face, most likely leaving splinters, but he didn't care. All that mattered to him was that Eunice Nicole Dursley was born on December eighteenth and she was okay. 









Dudley was complaining about his mother being in the hospital with Eunice this close to Christmas and Vernon was trying to soothe him with promises of more presents. Hari had use to pretend that maybe he would get a Christmas present if he was extra, extra good, and today he thought that maybe, just maybe, Eunice was his Christmas present. 









Apparently Petunia wouldn't be able to come home until the end of the week as the doctors wanted to make sure she and the baby were okay. Hari was very cautious taking this in. It could be very good, or very bad spending a whole week with a Ms. Figg. 









Vernon would be taking Dudley and staying in the King's Ivory Hotel, one of the many that Vernon's company apparently owned. He was pacifying his son with promises of endless movies and something called room service while Hari switched between daydreaming and a day-mare of what a Ms. Figg would be like. 









He had heard from the gossip circles that qualified as Ms. Petunia's Book Club on Wednesday, Companion taught him, that Ms. Figg bred very ugly cats for very high prices. She was one of the only non-white people who dared to live in Privet Drive, and the only one in general who took up such an odd pastime of breeding half-pure animals and trying to sell them. 









    Hari had seen one of these cats before, on the rare occasion he use to be let outside. One of them had been sitting on the cornerstone of the fence while he had been precariously weeding the garden. It had a squished face with ears longer than its head, and wide, round eyes that stared at him. It was covered in bright orange fur that seemed too long for its small body and gathered at its ears, chin, and long, fat tail. 









Hari didn't think it was ugly. On the contrary, he thought it was fascinating. The way that the golden eyes followed his movements and the fluffy tail swished back and forth--even the way it opened its smushed mouth to yawn and yowl at him. When Hari's green eyes met golden ones, he felt familiarity, as if he knew this animal. 









It didn't last long. 









Ms. Petunia had gone outside to check on Hari and spotted the creature, screeching words that Hari's companion called obscenities. She had thrown gardening tools at the poor animal before digging her nails into his arm and wrenching him back inside. It was the last time he had ever been allowed outside the house in what he now knew to be six months. 









Ms. Petunia had made a riot of it the next Book Club meeting, garnering all sorts of sympathy from her upper-suburban companions. They had all screeched at how they should make a petition to kick out Ms. Figg, and perhaps the others like her. 









While he detested any sort of Ms. Petunia's friends, he couldn't help but wonder what a Ms. Figg might be like, since the other Ms. Petunias seemed to frown down upon her so very much. 









He would get his answer very soon, he learned, as he was dragged out of his cupboard the next day. Vernon had forced him into some better looking clothes Dudley had grown too big for and made sure no bruises were visible before sending him with a bag to walk himself down the street. 









He was barely told the number (Number Eight of Wisteria Walk) before he was nearly hit by Mr. Dursley pulling out of the driveway 









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









Ms. Figg was an odd sort of woman, Hari decided. She was dark skinned and still had dark hair despite her old age, and her r's rolled together like music when she spoke. She had introduced herself as Ms. Arabella Figgueroa, but had laughed off his horrible, mangled mispronunciation and told him that he should call her Ms. Figg. 









Ms. Figg did indeed own many cats. She had two males; named Mr. Tibbles and Mr. Paws, and two females; Snowy and Tufty. Hari didn't understand why his companion found this so funny. 









Tufty had just had a litter of seven kittens, apparently fathered by the silver-coloured Mr. Paws. Snowy was currently pregnant by Mr. Tibbles, and Ms. Figg was hoping she had at least six. 









They all looked rather strange--much like Mr. Tibbles (the cat Hari later learned had been peeping on him). All having mostly normal squashed, cat-like features, but some sort of aura that was strange about them. Hari decided cats were okay, but he may not much like them. 









Ms. Figg's house was decorated in bright tiles and tightly hand-woven rugs she claimed had been passed down from her ancestors. She had immediately sat Hari down on the green couch sporting a heavily pregnant, non-much-too friendly Snowy, and whipped him up just a cuppa dear! 









'Just a cuppa' ended up being two kettles full--as many as Ms. Figg could stuff down Hari before he implored she stopped before his tummy burst. Ms. Figg decided to move on to biscuits next. 









She introduced Hari to her favourite shows on the telly, which Hari cautiously watched with her. Her favourites seemed to be hopeless romantic soap operas that had Companion begging for Hari to murder him, or dating games that had Companion offering to murder her. 









She also introduced Hari to needlepoint, knitting, and crocheting. Hari's small, nimble fingers made easy work of the yarn, but he couldn't admit to not seeing the point or to forgetting which way was a pearl and which way was a stitch, or which way to properly tie a knot of thread (which Hari found rather silly). 









It was three days into his visit that Hari committed an act of nonsense. 









He had tripped over a lump in one of Ms. Figg's decorative rugs and dropped a porcelain teacup. In his panic to avoid punishment, he hissed a small "":Repairo:,"" and watched the cup tumble back together. He watched the cup tumble back together two seconds too-late after noticing Ms. Figg in the doorway of the kitchen. 









Tears began to pool in scared eyes as he begged over and over not to let the Dursleys know, that he would take anything, any sort of punishment Ms. Figg wanted to give him. He promised her that she could hit him as much as she liked, he wouldn't tell, just as long as she kept his secret. 









How very shocking it was for Hari when at the end of his whispered pleadings Ms. Figg's dark eyes mirrored his own. Hari could see the years of her age physically pile up on her as she gazed at him, silent streaks running down from her eyes past the neckline of her blouse. She did nothing to stop them. 









She dropped to her knees with a great crack! against the spanish tile in her house, so quickly and so hard that Hari feared her knees had snapped. She began apologizing to him, of all people, begging for his forgiveness for not seeing the signs, for not doing something earlier. 









She outstretched her arms to him and Hari feared he would be punished, before chilling maroon magic pushed hundreds upon hundreds of memories into his head. Memories of himself being held in almost such a way by a redheaded woman and a man who looked like him, of being in a warm tummy with hands caressing outside him whispering words of endearments, of being kissed on the head by the humming woman from his dreams who cried and whispered Goodbye.  









He flung himself into her arms and allowed himself to be hugged for the first time in a long time, with hushed promises of safety and a better life and someone named Dumbledore coming to fix it over the top of his head. 









Hari decided he would miss Ms. Figg rather terribly at the end of the week. And he did. 









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









When Hari first met Eunice he was completely mesmerized. She had soft brown tufts on her too-small looking head and big blue eyes that would shine when she saw him. Hari fell in love instantly. He wanted her as his sister. He would protect her, and care for her, and love her, unlike Dudley. And strangely.....Ms. Petunia.













After being brought home from the hospital, Petunia wanted nothing to do with the small child. Petunia wouldn't hold her, barely fed her, and screamed incessantly when Eunice cried. 













And so, like many more things, the task of caring for Eunice fell to Hari. Hari couldn't help but feel excited. He would cradle her when she was fussy, and hum the song from his dreams, and read to her the books his companion shared, and even make bright spots of light out of nothing to make her giggle when she became especially upset. He became the one designated to feed her, change her, clothe her, bathe her, and put her to sleep. 













Dudley couldn't do it, for he was only a boy. 













Vernon couldn't do it, since that was women's work. 













Petunia couldn't do it, since she refused to hardly look in the child's direction, let alone care for her. 













So Hari became her big brother. And Hari loved it, and Hari loved her, and Hari was loved by her. 













Hari was the one who taught her to smile, to roll over along the floor (when Petunia would allow it), and to begin babbling. He was also the one who began to hush her cries when Ms. Petunia was screaming, or when Eunice witnessed Vernon or Dudley punishing him, soothing her with quite instructions of ""you need to cry quietly, please, Eunice, please!"" 













And it was so that when Ms. Petunia decided to take Eunice away from him, Hari decided to say no. 













No. She didn't get to abandon Eunice for months on end, hating her very existence for not being back inside her belly, and then claim her back, simply because she hated Hari. No. She didn't get to pretend to love Eunice, only to leave her squalling at night, starving, like she had the weeks before she was assigned to Hari. No. She simply didn't get to decide to give Hari the most precious thing he had had in his life and then rip it away from him. 













When Ms. Petunia's decision was announced, Hari rebelled. He rebelled for the first time in his small life, for the most precious thing he currently had. 













He reached out to the roots of his magic and felt for the darkest, hottest parts of it. The parts that could burn you alive or freeze you to death. Glass had rattled and exploded, leaving Ms. Petunia's fine china in teeny tiny shards across the floor. Wood furniture cracked, granite broke, the wind practically screamed. 













When Mr. Dursley had reached out for him by his hair, his arm was twisted back in the wrong direction. Sickening popping noises teased their way through the room over the howling of the gathering storm outside as Vernon's arm continued to warp past its limit, drawing high pitched shrieks from all Hari's audience. 













He was prepared to continue, to rip it off; if he had too, until Petunia gained a calm look on her face and placed her hand over Eunice's face. 

















The wind hushed. 

















The furniture halted. 

















Hari didn't even breathe. 

















""Fix it, or you'll be responsible for what happens next."" Ms. Petunia said, her bony fingers curling around the babe's delicate neck. 

















Vernon's arm was forcibly ripped back into place. 

















China repaired itself faster than it had broken. 

















Hari counted all the ways he could think of to kill himself. 

















Petunia uncurled her hands from around the baby and set her on the table, seemingly oblivious to Eunice's terrified cries. Hari felt a gut wrenching guilt he had caused such a reaction from her. He had only wanted to protect her, and instead had terrified her. 

















""You will no longer have direct contact with my child until she can learn how to put you in your place. You have lost the privileges of breakfast, and your meals are to be held whenever we see fit."" 

















Hari sucked in a small breath. This meant no more guaranteed food. Which meant more necessary stealing. Which meant more risks of getting caught. 

















He nodded submissively, refusing the tears that wanted to fall past his eyelashes and leave hot trails down his cheeks. 

















Hari had loved, had been loved, and now Hari had lost.

Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air


(Or rather, an Introduction to the Elements)


When July came around, and Hari turned six, Companion bestowed a new gift upon him. Companion taught him how to change things. Hari could now transfigure useless objects he learned to hoard into books. Obviously he didn't need to hoard more than one or two things, as he could change them back and forth as he pleased (or rather, when there was danger of him being discovered), but Hari liked to pretend that each item was its own book. 

The piece of tinfoil from his first rice pudding cup was a Potion's theory book, written in strange squiggles that Hari could read just as easy as english. The broken soldier man Dudley had thrown at him (accusing Hari of breaking it) was a book of magical history. Strips of an old, unusable, extra-ratty dishrag became Transfiguration for Beginners, Introduction to Alchemy, and Alchemy vs. Transfiguration. 

He couldn't practice, let alone begin to imagine successfully attempting most of the theories and spells in his books. Most of them made no sense, and his Companion had to slither about and explain them in easier contexts. 

    Much like both his knowledge and his collection, Hari's companion had been growing too. 

What had started out as a great snake nearly the length of Hari in dark red, was now over twice that length in shades of deep purple, borderline indigo. His eyes remained the same grey-blue from their first meeting, yet his personality had shifted just as much as his magic. 

Instead of biting sarcasm or offended rants, Companion tended to attempt to explain the theories, their purposes, and in what ways they could possibly be necessary. Instead of long-winded (and mostly terrifying) tirades about how he would be most enjoyed to murder Hari's relatives, and exactly how it would go about, there were mainly hushed, hissed words of comfort while Hari was being beaten, a blanket of what felt like heavy river water covering his being. 

Make no mistake that there still were rants and tirades of all sorts, and that his companion could pout like nobody's business (though Hari tried to keep that thought to himself). But Companion was trying, and that was what mattered most to Hari.


'Hari...' Hari felt pressure against the front of his head, much like how Ms. Figg's cats butt their heads against everything. 

'Speaking of the devil.' Hari teased. He knew that his companion enjoyed nicknames like this. 

'You're getting weaker.' He hissed. 

Hari had foregone the idea of magically duplicating food that would disappear hours later, after almost getting caught twice. 

The first time Hari had nearly been caught, it was only by Dudley. Hari hadn't worried much since the worst the Dursleys would do was to give Dudley a light punishment for imagining things and then punish Hari for the possibility of it being true. But Dudley didn't notice when one of his seven fruit cups had suddenly disappeared. He seemed a bit confused as he reached for more and there was none, but shrugged it off and merely went back to the fridge. 

So Hari continued. 

Then Mr. Vernon nearly caught him. He had been pilfering Ms. Petunia's baking graham crackers when suddenly one of the packages was open and half missing. Once that Vernon was sure he hadn't touched it yet, Vernon came to the conclusion that Hari must have nicked some food while Vernon hadn't been looking. 

Hari had been cleaning the floors of the kitchen while Vernon was watching some sort of sport on the telly when suddenly he was ripped up by his hair and shoved into the bucket of dirty water. He struggled and fought, his small arms pushing against the flimsy plastic sides of the bucket as sweet, acidic liquid made its way up his nose and down his throat. 

He thought that he would die there. For a moment he didn't mind as his vision spotted and his lungs seemed to burn. Then he was let up and all he could do was cough and wheeze, alternating between asphyxiating on the water spilling from his mouth and gulping down air. 

It didn't last long. 

The sponge he was using to clean was shoved in his mouth, the sharp chemical-filled water leaving stinging trails down his chin and neck. When Hari finally choked down the water from the sponge, swallowing the bits that his teeth ripped off, it was torn from his mouth.  

When he was thrown onto the floor he braced himself against the floor, expelling rust coloured water from his stomach. His arms were shaking and his face was covered in vomit and tears leaked from his face. Hari thought it was over. 

He was wrong. 

He was once again pulled up by his hair, flung backwards onto his back. He watched Vernon lumber over him, his sleeves rolled up and his face purpling. His arms were soaked and his eyes glint when he forced the brown sponge back into Hari's mouth. 

Hari tried to keep his mouth closed, holding his breath, until Vernon forced Hari's head back and squeezed the chemical-filled liquid into his nose. Violent, choking coughs wracked the small boy as Vernon forced the cleaning product back in Hari's mouth. 

Over and over again He was forced to swallow the mop water, until the bucket was nearing empty and he was simply strewn to-and-fro in his own sick due to the amount.  

He was saved by the least likely source--Ms. Petunia. Petunia had come in, holding an irate Eunice in what seemed be a too-tight tutu dress. She took one look at Vernon over Hari and shrieked.  

""What are you doing to the floors, Vernon! We're having guests!"" 

She had been more concerned over the repulsive smell emanating from the Kitchen and whether or not it would stain rather than the potential body count her floor would soon gain. 

So Hari had been left alone in his mess, instructed to clean it up before the guests arrived in an hour. 

He had barely accomplished it, vomiting more than he was cleaning. On shaky arms and numb legs he finished his task, before passing out outside his cupboard. 

He had been punished again later when Petunia had to stall so Vernon could shove him in. 

Since then, Hari had not tried to duplicate food. Instead, he took to digging through scraps. He would pick off pieces of food left in pots and pans before he cleaned them, or after he was done cooking, dig through the garbage a few hours after meals when he learned it was safe, and even leave out food to spoil a bit to be thrown out. 

He had not yet been discovered, and was becoming better with persuasion magic to make sure he wouldn't be. 

He couldn't force someone to stay in a room, or make decisions they wouldn't normally, or choose actions that went against their personality; but he could cause distractions. A wondering about favourite tv shows on, even if they knew it wouldn't be, a push in the direction of needing to use the restroom, buying Hari a bit of time, or even something as simple as yawning or stretching to warn if how close someone was. 

'You haven't eaten in days.' 

Hari was currently being punished for burning just too much of Vernon's eggs. Petunia had decided that Hari's punishment would be to stay locked in his cupboard for an indeterminable amount of time. 

He hadn't been let out to clean, eat, or use the restroom  

It had been almost a week and Hari was feeling nauseous. He was too fearful of sneaking out since Eunice cried all hours of the night and kept up Ms. Petunia, but his chance was coming. It was Sunday and the Dursleys would be leaving. 

He waited until he could no longer hear the roar of the engine in the driveway and slid his fingers along the crack of his door. 

"":Alohomora:,"" He hissed. 

He slowly creaked open the door, peering out every direction before stepping out. He slipped quickly into the kitchen, his tiny feet echoing sharp slaps against the wood and tile in the house. 

On the island counter there was a large, cooling casserole. His mouth watered at the sight of it. Though his burnt food usually tasted better than what Petunia whipped up, Hari was so hungry. 

'Use an expansion charm. Then force it to stay.' His companion whispered. 

Hari felt confused. 'What?' 

'Take a small slice, or a few. Then expand the dish to cover the gaps.' 

'Why didn't you teach me this earlier!?' Hari was upset. If he had known how to make food stay then he wouldn't have been punished. He forced himself to calm down--Companion must have a reason.  

'The food is tasteless and will eventually vanish. When impacted it begins to dissolve. They would have noticed when they couldn't actually eat or their food wouldn't crunch beneath their teeth. If you had expanded your own food, it would have shrunk in your stomach.' 

So he would have been punished anyway.....or would of starved to death. 

Hari took slivers along the ends of the dish, muttering Crescere to fill the gaps. 

'How do I make it stay?' 


'Lignum. It's a temporary sticking charm. Only focus on making the expansion charm stay, else the entire dish will stick to its container.'


Hari felt a bit silly as he pictured a whole casserole without the dish, but he did as told. He always would for Companion. 

The few badly cooked slices of casserole sitting in Hari's cupped hands felt like a feast to him. He savored the feeling of food in his mouth rather than the taste, taking small nibbles and holding his breath when he held it in his mouth. 

When he was finished he licked the remnants off of his hands, surprisingly without any comments of how revolting it was to lick his hands from Companion.  

He began making his way back to the cupboard when he was stopped by soft scales pressing against his mind. 

'You should be enjoying yourself.' 

'I did. I ate.' 

'You used to like the outdoors, why not venture outside?' His companion offered. 

Hari thought about it. It had been a while.....It had been a long while. He missed the feeling of the sun on his face, the grass against his skin, the earth between his toes, the taste of the wind. Even the replicated memories he ventured to as Companion taught him could hardly mimic the real thing. 

'I believe I will.' Hari offered back. 

He decided to go out the side door of the garage, careful that no one had seen him. When the Dursleys caught whispers of a strange brown boy in the neighborhood, Hari had been left with what Companion called a concussion and refused to let Hari sleep that night. He had been lectured about being more careful in between the pummelings of fists, making sure that no one knew it was the Dursleys who housed such a freak.


He walked around the neighborhood, taking note of which houses held familiar cars he often saw leaving after Petunia's book club, and which ones looked very similar to the one Mr. Vernon drove to work. He walked all the way through Privet Drive and came to a little corner sign that pointed in three directions. The left was Wisteria Walk, the middle course continued Privet Drive, and the right led to Manzanita Trace. 

Hari wanted to go visit Ms. Figg. He hadn't seen her in a while and the pavement was starting to blister his feet. He made a left and began walking to Number Eight. 

It was a pretty light-grey brick one story house with dark shingling and white windows and doors. He could see the cream coloured curtains pulled in front of the shutters and imagined Ms. Figg sitting in her green armchair while her kittens took up the sofa. He liked to think perhaps she was making tea, or reading one of her romance novels she forbade him from touching. 

He gently rapped on the white door and waited a few moments. He expected to see a Ms. Figg with a book in her hand, or perhaps a teacup, or even one or several of her odd cats to prevent them from escaping. 

What he did not expect was to see a worn out, disheveled looking Ms. Figg covered in soot and ash. Her hair was in a disarrayed bun, grey streaks more prominent than ever. Dark purple-black bags hung under her usually brilliant brown eyes that seemed to have lost their warmth, rimmed a bright red that led water stains down her face. Once she realized who was at the door she gave Hari a bright smile, but Hari couldn't help but compare how dull it seemed with the ones she had given him before. 

""Hari! Oh, Hari dear. Oh--darling--please come in!""  

She ushered him inside with feather-soft touches against his shoulders, something he was very grateful for, and dabbed at her eyes with the edge of her blouse. It smeared soot around her face, but Hari thought it would be rather rude to point that out. 

She led him to the couch and shooed off a rather affectionate Mr. Tibbles, who seemed to butt at Hari persistently. 

""Hari, dear, I'm so sorry,"" she began to cry, running the tracks of her face wet again. ""I--I tried to explain to them, to the Ministry and to Dumbledore, but they simply wouldn't listen. I've been trying dear, I promise."" 

She seemed quite upset about something Hari couldn't completely grasp. Hari did the only thing he knew how in order to comfort her--he hugged her. He crawled up onto her lap and stretched his thin arms around her round, soft body and buried his face in her shoulder. 

In return she wrapped her long arms around him and cried into the tameless curls of his hair. 

""It's alright..."" he said slowly. He never spoke unless he was hissing out spells, and his voice was rough from disuse. ""You did everything you could."" 

""I--I offered to take you, I could teach you, but they--they said--they said that you're safer with your aunt and uncle!"" 

She gave a hysterical laugh and Hari froze. 

""My aunt and uncle?"" 

She sniffled lightly and pulled back from him. Hari looked up at her, curious and open and so scared; that her body jerked along with her sobs. Ms. Figg forced composure upon herself. 









""They never--they never told you?"" 









Hari shook his head. Ms. Figg took shaky, deep breaths and began to explain. 









""Petunia and Vernon are your aunt and uncle. Dudley and the baby are your cousins. Petunia was Lily's, your mother, sister. When she and your father, James, died you were transferred to their guardianship."" Her voice soured at the end, similar to the face she made when she over-boiled tea.  






Lily and James. Hari finally had something to hold on to. He had asked his companion several times about his parents, but Companion always went quiet and still and wouldn't speak for the rest of the day. Lily and James. Names to the faces he treasured that his companion had pushed forward that one day, to the voices that told Hari they loved him.










Ms. Figg seemed to hesitate before steeling herself. 





""They.....They're the reason you can do what you can do."" She gave him a very deliberate look and Hari drew his brows together. 









'Magic, small one,' Companion hissed. Hari was surprised--both because his companion never wanted to talk about Hari's parents and because his parents could do it too. 









Hari had always had an inkling--after all, with thoughts of Hogwarts running around in his head from his companion Hari knew he wasn't the only one like this. It was both comforting and isolating; he wasn't alone in ability, but he was alone here. And yet.....his parents could do it too... 









""Your mother was a brilliant witch. My son, Cristiano, use to complain about how she beat him out of Astrology and Arithmancy. They were his favourite subjects at Hogwarts. I believed he had quite the crush on her, many people did."" 









Ms. Figg adopted a sad smile, and stared at the fireplace with a look that Hari didn't like on her face. It was too sad, too painful, and it didn't belong on Ms. Figg's face, whom Hari believed only deserved happiness. 









""Hogwarts--that's a school, right?"" 









She didn't seem perturbed that he knew this, either convinced that he came to a conclusion based on her explanation or having heard of it previously (though where he would have besides Companion, Hari didn't know, and no one but Hari knew of his companion). 









""Yes. A school for magical children. There are many of them, I went to one myself when I was younger."" She seemed both happy and sad; a word that his companion called reminiscent. 









""Though I went to Castelobruxo instead of Hogwarts, I sent Cristiano there because of a deal with my husband."" 









She laughed to herself, though it was a hollow noise. Like the last remnants of an abandoned house lighting up. 









'Castel Broom shoes?' Hari crinkled his nose at the name. And he thought Hogwarts was weird. 









'No,' His companion laughed, 'Castelobruxo. It's in South America. Hidden in the rain forest.' Images of thick flora and exotic fauna filled his mind, large dewdrops gathered as big as Hari's fist in leaves larger than Hari's body. It was beautiful, Hari decided. 









""Your father was in Gryffindor."" Her voice was tight and drawn, echoed by the lines suddenly appearing on her face. ""Hogwarts has four houses, you see. Gryffindor is the house of the brave, and there was no better place for James Potter. He became an Auror after school, one of the best there was. He served under Alastor Moody, the best Auror this millennium has ever seen."" 









Hari latched on eagerly, tears beginning to well in his eyes. He had never heard such things about his parents--especially his father. He felt something for the first time: pride. 









""And my--my mother?"" 









Ms. Figg smiled gratefully at him, the way Hari imagined his mother would have smiled. 









""She was in Hufflepuff, the house of the hard-working and true. And oh did she earn her place!"" Ms. Figg laughed again, and it was a better sound than the one before. ""She made the best grades, and won four awards for the highest of the class at the end of her Seventh Year. She was learning how to become an Alchemist and a Potions Mistress.""










""I very much believe that if she had--if she had lived,"" Ms. Figg stumbled and dabbed at her eyes, starting once more. ""I very much believe that if she had lived, she would have become the most wonderful Potions Mistress the world has ever seen, at least for a very long time."" 









Hari began to cry, and Ms. Figg couldn't stop her sniffles that joined him. He had escaped early in the morning and the Dursleys always took till after lunch to return. It was nearing nine-o'clock, and Hari stayed at Ms. Figg's as long as he could. 









They spoke of many things in that time, yet Ms. Figg seemed hesitant to talk about Hari's father and placated him with tales of his mother. About how she was the brightest witch of her time and had a tendency to get carried away in letting everyone know. About how James was every teacher's worst nightmare from the minute he stepped off the train. About how Lily's best friends were Severus Snape, Alice Longbottom, and Marlene McKinnon, and how they rivaled his father's group of  and Frank Longbottom, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin, but seldom got caught when retaliating against the self-proclaimed ""Marauders"". 









And finally, before Hari left, they spoke of his parents' death. Of James' betrayal in order to try to save his wife, and how he was offering up his son in return for being spared. 









And suddenly, Hari wasn't so proud of his father anymore. 









Ms. Figg had once told him that sometimes good people made bad decisions to save the people they love. Hari didn't understand why James didn't love him, and asked her quite frankly that very question. Ms. Figg had gone very silent for a long while. And when she spoke, she spoke very quietly. 









""No matter what happened that night, it is not your fault."" 









She assured him that she believed quite furiously that both his parents loved him very much. 









Hari didn't believe her. He so desperately wanted to, but how could someone who supposed to love him leave him like that? 









When Hari had left it was another tearful goodbye.He had ran as fast as his legs would carry him back to Number Four of Privet Drive, hopelessly praying to whatever was out there that he would make it back before the Dursleys did. 









He scraped his callused hands scrambling over the garden wall and twisted his ankle when he fell into the rose bushes down below. Cuts of varying depths and sizes covered his body as he crawled out, forcing himself along the sticker-infested grass and into the doggy-door Vernon had had installed for his sister, Mrs. Nelson. 









He was very careful about rubbing up the blood with the rags that served as his shirt. He was deadly sure that he didn't dare leave a single streak of muck or blood. His feet burned and it was making Hari sweat with how much magic he had to use to prevent the blisters on them from bursting until he was safely inside his cupboard.  









Once inside he forced his magic to heal him, ignoring the screamed warnings inside his head that he needed words or he could cause more harm. He simply didn't have time. As he felt cuts sizzling closed and blisters reversing themselves, which was twice as painful as obtaining them, Hari's magic began to take its toll. He had never used so much at one time, especially not so much without structure. 









So Hari did the only thing he could do. Hari fainted. 









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









Hari was locked in his cupboard until Wednesday. He could tell by the growling of the other Ms. Petunia's cars that they had borrowed from their husbands and by the clicking of heels against wood accompanied by their wearers' high pitched chitter-chatter. 









He cast a silencing charm to surround the inside of the cupboard, mostly due to his companion's complaints. It became a nice time for a nap and Hari blacked out. 









He was deposited back into his mindscape; a place Hari still couldn't figure out how to purposely visit. He could even count the amount of times he had been to his mindscape on one hand and still have fingers left over. It still looked like it did the first time; much like a vast, empty void. 









His companion was in his snake form, as usual. Hari took in his long, thick body that had most definitely grown. The last time Hari had seen him, He was a deep purple that had began turning blue, and just over twice his original length and width with black eye-like patterns. 









Now, Companion was a grey sea-blue with wave like patterns that glittered black. He was as thick as both of Hari's arms and legs all put together and had grown at least an extra foot or two. 









'Hari...' his companion greeted. 









'Companion. You've been quiet lately.' Despite his usual rantings over Petunia's book club and the toned down death threats he offered every time they passed the Dursleys, Companion had been eerily silent since Sunday with Ms. Figg. 









Companion's tongue flicked out slowly, as if he was contemplating something. 









'Hari.....I need to speak with you.' His body curled in around itself, as if he was afraid. It was a strange thing to feel coming from his companion. 









'Well you'll have to explain what we're doing now if we aren't already speaking,' Hari teased. 









'It's about your father.' 









Hari froze. Companion never willingly spoke of the Potters. Even after Sunday he had been near completely silent, except for the expected tirades that sounded half-hearted even to Hari. 









'There are things you need to know, but I can only explain so many of them--I can only remember so many of them.' 









Hari felt Companion's need for Hari to understand. Reluctantly, Hari accepted the foreign magic and watched as the mindscape swirled like an animated Starry Night. 









The transparent floor began to grow grass, peeking out as if through a thick, ashy fog. Hari heard the sound of waves echoing through the expansion, completely entranced as a large lake began to take shape through the blackness.  









He could see that instead of a single pane of simply darkness, his void was made up of many layers. Dense, mud-consistent smoke packed together, one layer on top of the other, intermingling and thinning out to a soft, grey mist that became the colour of seafoam as the lake began to emerge. From the grass grew bricks, and the bricks piled together the most magnificent castle he had ever seen! It was several stories tall with hundreds of dark windows and half a dozen visible towers and he just knew that this castle was Hogwarts. 









The overhead levels of empty space faded into a cloudy blue sky, with sunshine that Hari could almost feel on his face. He swung his head around to his companion, only to stop when he spotted dozens of masked figures huddled in multiple half-circles. 









Every figure wore a black cloak with tapering hoods and bone-white masks. They reminded Hari of those muggles he has seen on the telly, only they wore white and he was vaguely sure they didn't each have decorated masks. Each circle had their own style, and Hari focused on one in the center who was steadily approaching him, the others parting like fog. 









Their mask was bone-white as the others, but as they came closer Hari could make out the details decorating it--golden swirls curled around the eye and nostril slits, while the mouth was carved out in a similar fashion to prison bars. 









They removed their mask, and Hari was met with a startling older version of himself. Shorter curls stuck around his face, glasses formed from the mist to settle on top of a nose that appeared to have been broken too many times to remain straight, but hazel eyes shone wrong. It appeared as if a stranger was staring at him through James' eyes. 









'I use to be part of a man who calls himself Voldemort.' His companion seemed very ashamed of himself, and very lost He curled around Hari's feet and worked his way up till his upper body was draped precariously over Hari's shoulders. 









'We were--I was-- A madman. I can hardly remember what it was like being in his head.....Everything felt so fractured and wrong. I could barely tell one day apart from the other, plans began intermingling, thoughts came and went and were forgotten.....' 









'But the night I became part of you is clear, Hari. You were supposed to kill me. You and another boy--Neville Longbottom. So I went after you both in the hopes of postponing my death. I both failed and succeeded.' 









Hari stilled, and he felt the snake slip from his shoulders. Absently, he thought he should probably be grateful for the space being provided by his companion, but all he could feel was terror. His heart began constricting in his chest, his breath catching as if Vernon's hand was wrapped around his throat. 









'My body was destroyed and I was put inside you, but that matters little at the moment.' Companion curled himself into a tight knot and laid his head on his body, mimicking a dog rolled onto its stomach. 'These are the Deatheaters. They were--are--Voldemort's followers, if you will. They.....we raided Saint Mungo's the night the two of you were born. I am unaware of the casualties, I was ripped away the moment I--' 









He cut himself off, his voice clinical and cold and rushed to get everything out.He seemed to curl impossibly tighter around himself before he spoke again, this time his voice very small, 'I--I am sorry. I cannot begin to imagine any apology that would convey how much I regret my actions. Nor have I yet decided which is the more fitting of punishments--to be unembodied, trapped incorporeally inside one of thousands of victims, or to gain back my mind, only to have the weight of my sins continue to rip apart the edges of my sanity. I--' 









He cut himself off once more, his voice growing heavy. Hari didn't think snakes could cry, but he didn't have any other name for the stilted, wet sounds coming from his Companion. felt conflicted.....This was the man who took his parents from him, who forced him with the Dursleys, the reason for everything..... 









But it wasn't. It was only a piece; of him, whatever that meant, and this piece certainly didn't seem the type to knowingly ruin Hari's life.....Mad men didn't cry after all, did they? 













And his companion certainly didn't have a say in Hari's choice of residence, and certainly didn't have a say in the way the Dursleys treated him. In fact, he had healed and taught Hari, going as far as to protect Hari when the punishments were too severe. 













Hari made up his mind. 













He knelt down, reaching out to pull the parts of the gargantuan snake that he could fit onto his lap. Companion seemed to simultaneously recoil from the touch and wrap himself around Hari, seeking more. He choked out stilted apologies with words Hari didn't understand, but accepted quietly anyway, each one loosening the death grip inside his chest. 













'It seem--It seems that the on-only comfort I may offer you,' He stopped, and took a deep, hissing breath, 'It seems that the only comfort I may offer you is that I can assure you I no longer consider myself Voldemort, let alone a piece of him.' Each word was slow and deliberate, and Hari stroked down his Companion's spine in a small attempt of affection. 













They stayed there for long moments before his Companion raised his head from his many coils to speak again, but all Hari knew was pain as he was physically ripped from his mindscape. 













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













One of the Ms. Petunias, a Mrs. Blanton, had seen Hari running back from the cross-sign and into the Dursleys yard. She had explained that she had seen this once before, a few months ago, and was frankly surprised that Petunia and Vernon could house such a thing. 













She had told her story in the middle of book club, in front of one Mrs. Hinz, a schoolteacher at the elementary. Several of the others confirmed either story, through first or second or millionth hand knowledge, which proposed a question about why wasn't he in school? from Mrs. Hinz. 













Petunia had to play her cards very carefully, explaining that Hari was born later in the year and therefore was expected to start in September with the other children. After all, they had only been housing him a few months. 













So when Hari received the news that he would be going to school in a few months by a smiling Ms. Petunia, he believed he was about to die. She told him that since he was a schoolboy now that he needed to be clean, and ushered him into the bathroom. He had been very confused as Ms. Petunia ordered him to strip and lay in the tub, until he placed his foot inside and it immediately went numb at the cold. 













This was a new game. 













He had snatched his foot out of the water almost as fast as Petunia backhanded him into the towel rack. She pulled him up by his hair and told him that he would either get in and stay in until Petunia came and fetched him, or she would drown him. 













Hari forced himself into the water, even as every cell in his being screamed at him for doing so.  













Ms. Petunia instructed him to lay in the water with his face lowered, or she would push it in. When Hari lowered his head till the water was brushing his cheeks, she had decided it wasn't fast enough and placed her long, thin hand over his face and pushed him down. 













Ice-water invaded his lungs and his numb limbs could barely put up a fight. The only thing he could do was cough and cause more water to invade his nose. When she finally let him up she kept her hand placed threateningly on his face, whispering very close to him,













""If you move a muscle, or so much as tilt your head, I'll call Marjorie and allow her mutt to do whatever it wants to you.""













She removed her hand and watched expectantly. Hari quickly sunk his head back underwater, careful to keep his nose just above enough the he could catch tiny breaths. Petunia huffed and slunk out the door, purposefully leaving it open.













Hari didn't know how long he was in there, only that it was long enough for his body to begin automatically shivering and long enough for it to stop.













Hari had tried to reach out to his companion, only to feel an emptiness where he once was.













The lack of the mental presence was more horrifying to Hari than his current situation. He didn't know what he would do without his companion. After all, he'd been there even before Hari could remember.













When Hari began to question if you could cry underwater, Petunia came in and twisted her fingers into Hari's hair and violently jerked him up. She lifted him so high that when she let go he felt a crack against his pelvis hitting the bottom of the bathtub. She pulled out an aluminum scrubber and an old bar of used soap before beginning to scrub him raw.













In some places she would simply leave it red, puffy, and heavily irritated. In others she didn't stop scrubbing until blood began dripping into the bathwater.













When he was finished with his bath Petunia told him that they were now being forced to buy him school supplies, and that Hari now owed them. In no uncertain terms did she make clear that Hari was ordered to do anything in order to pay them back. She didn't care about how he did it or what he did, and even less about what happened to him, as long as the debt was paid off in the end.













Then she had thrown an old shirt of Dudley's that had been dried too many times at him along with what he thought use to be pants but had been cut.













Then she had thrown him in his cupboard after he finished dressing.













Hari felt the weight of loneliness beginning to consume him. Without his companion he would have no one to turn to, no one to help him, no one who cared for him like his companion did.













He just wanted his friend back.













Silvery slick tears made their way down from his eyes and past his nose, over his cheek and onto the floor as he thought about a life without that sort of magic. He would give it up if he could have the voice back--he would take a dozen punishments all in a row.













'You're--ridiculous,' a voice whispered. It sounded older and more tired than his companion ever had, but Hari couldn't care less.














'Worrying over something like me....when you're practically freezing to death.'














'Where were you? What happened?' Hari asked fervently.













'You were awoken from your mindscape...A very dangerous thing to pull someone out of...especially someone untrained.' His companion took several heaving breaths, and Hari hugged himself tight when he felt sluggish scales graze against him.













Hari suddenly felt very awkward. When they had left off, his companion had been crying on him.














'So....you use to be this Voldemort guy?'















'Yes.'















'But you aren't anymore? You're like...your own guy?'















'...In lack of better phrasing--yes.'















'But you're still a part of me?'















'Yes. As I always will be.'














Hari felt a sort of muted elation--his companion would always be with him! He would never leave, never abandon Hari; he would live as Hari lived. Though now, Hari understood exactly how his companion had come to be. Despite his own sore excitement, he could feel sleep tugging at him as his magic worked to repair both himself and Companion.














'If you're your own person...then who are you?'















'I...do not know. I am no one, I suppose.'














Hari didn't think that sounded very nice.














'Well, what was your name before you were Voldemort?'














His companion seemed to hesitate, as if he was once again afraid.














'My name was Tom.'















'It's nice to meet you, Tom.'















'It's...It's nice to meet you too, Hari.'














Hari smiled and allowed sleep to claim him.

Three Strikes


(Or rather, ""You're Out"")


As promised, Hari began school in September. He attended West Bridge Elementary along with his now-known-to-be cousin Dudley, who was a year ahead of him in Year 3.

When questioned about where he went to Kindergarten, Hari had corrected him that he wasn't smart enough to go to Kindergarten, and that it was only for good boys like Dudley. His first teacher, Ms. Priskit, was horrified at the prospect of his parents instilling such ideas in him and praised the Dursleys for taking him under their wing, while his second teacher Ms. Trinsing laughed off his explanation as if he had told a silly joke.

And true to her word, Ms. Petunia did keep up with all the receipts of everything she bought him, adding in variables such as having to be seen with him and driving him around in their nice car. Even when she threw in the cheapest items that were most likely to break, she treated everything as if the mere prospect of spending money on him was causing her physical pain.

So when he began classes on September first, Hari knew he was woefully unprepared. Each child had several notebooks; Hari only had one. Many of the children had dozens upon dozens of brightly coloured pencils packed into plastic boxes; Hari only had a small ten-pack to last him through the year. Some children brought extra things, like sharpeners or erasers or crayons; Hari wore clothes that almost fit.

His first year had been dreadful. Every child wanting to know where he came from and why they hadn't seen him before and why was his skin different than their own? With a strong odor he couldn't help, dark skin instead of light, and clothes that were riddled with holes and too large on him--Hari was immediately an outcast.

No child wanted to be caught dead around Hari, which was something that pleased his cousin Dudley. Dudley took full advantage of the situation, and had beaten Hari into the wood chips of the playground. Hari had curled up and took it, and several children responded positively to his punishment.

When Dudley had been pulled off by a flustered Ms. Priskit, he forced large tears into his eyes and whined that Hari was making fun of his family. Hari glanced at other children, hoping for a rescue, but knew his fate at school was sealed when several of them nodded along with Dudley's story.

Since Dudley began to have the upper hand outside, Hari decided to have the upper hand inside. When being taught the letter system of grading he knew he could do better than the C's that Dudley came home with, that had small red pennings of try better next time! next to a smiley face.

Hari took the advantage of intelligence. He absorbed everything he could, marking his works in painfully neat handwriting that made his fingers cramp something awful. He would converse with his companion--with Tom--during storytime and recess (as he had taken to hiding inside), begging for him to teach Hari more about the simplistic things he was learning now.

So Tom complied.

Tom filled Hari with his magic and released knowledge over everything to do with these subjects. He let, and forced, his gift to be accepted into Hari's memory to mingle and become Hari's own. It caused Hari to black out the night they did it and arrive to school late for his second class, and for Tom to go missing for nearly two days.

But Hari was grateful. He knew he wouldn't get as far with his maths and language arts that he knew he could for a very long while. He also understood that Tom couldn't have a repeat performance for a long time, nor did he encourage such a big, forceful merging at one time. He explained that having too much at one time would eventually break Hari's mind. He wouldn't be able to sort facts from opinions, then memory from dreams, and then thoughts from actions. Hari would be lost in a reality all his own as his brain tried to force the foreign entity out of itself.

And so, Hari excelled at his schoolwork. His writing became neater the more he did it and hurt his fingers less, and he was always pleasant to his teachers. When his first report card came, he couldn't wait to show it off. 

After all, this must prove the Dursleys wrong, correct? He had received all A's with the highest marks in his class, even several stickers next to the smiley-faced 100s that littered his work. His companion praised him each time, and Hari could feel Tom expanding himself to fill Hari's mind as much as he could.

It was their version of a hug; at least while they were awake.

So when Hari received his report card with exemplary marks and a large, warm hug from Tom, he knew he couldn't let the Dursleys throw this away. He stuffed it down his pants and held it there with the ratted string that served as his belt. He knew the Dursleys wouldn't ask him about his marks--they never did--and so Hari had no reason to worry.

How very unfortunate when he returned to Number Four of Privet Drive, forty-five minutes later than Dudley as usual, to find Ms. Petunia smiling that smile at him and asking for his report card.

At first Hari tried to pretend that he didn't know what she was talking about, but all that did was earn him gaudy red nails digging into his arm and assuring him that Petunia was quite positive that he received his today.

Dubiously, Hari handed over his card. At the beginning of the day Hari had been proud of himself, but now it was all he could do to keep his body from quivering. Ms. Petunia curled up her nose as he removed it from his waistband, but snatched away as soon as it was a safe distance from his grubby clothes.

When she saw the line of As and the delicately written an all around exemplary student!; in the comments section her smile only grew.









""So,"" she had said. ""Not only a thief, but a cheat as well. How typical.""









She believed he had copied and stolen other students work, passing it off as his own to sympathetic brainless floozies. She screwed his arm back the wrong way, much like he had to Vernon, tugging him up close to her her.









""If I catch you cheating again,"" She had hissed, ""I'll snap your fingers.""









She punctuated her point by ripping back the first two fingers of Hari's right hand. They splintered with a sickening snap that had Hari biting through his bottom lip to prevent himself from screaming.









He learned that day to fall behind in class. To lie when the teachers asked him what was wrong, or if he was okay, or if he didn't understand. He learned that he had to be sub-par to Dudley, so that the Dursley's unextraordinary son could shine in the household.









It hadn't changed.









He barely scraped by to be thrown into third year as Dudley entered fourth. He was spurred on by watching Eunice begin to sit up on her own and learning to crawl. When she had begun to pull up on objects, watching her made Hari's heart ache terribly. And when she began to cry teething Hari thought his heart would just fall out. He purposely got himself in trouble despite Tom's frightful warnings when Eunice said her first word: Mumma. 









Despite the fact he hadn't held her, or had any close contact with her in a little over a year, Hari still adored her. He adored her pudgy feet that ran across the house all day, her high pitched giggles when she watched the princesses on the telly, and even her tantrums when Ms. Petunia tried to force her to wear something she didn't want to.









It was December now, and Eunice was turning two years old to Hari's seven and Dudley's nine. Ms. Petunia was planning a birthday party for her, which Hari thought was odd since the woman could barely stand to touch Eunice. Most of her preschool had been invited, except the odd child or few who hadn't lived up to the Dursley's standards.









So Hari was now slaving away after arriving back to Number Four from school. He was put in charge of preparing all sorts of pastries and sweets and decorations and gift bags that it made his head spin. 









His hands were covered in burns of varying degrees and sizing from the oven and the pans currently holding pink velvet cupcakes that Eunice had screamed for. The bottom layer of the cake was cooling on the counter, readying for the whipped icing Hari had to attempt four times in order to make correctly. He had to pop the cupcakes out of the loose-bottom baking tin with the thin end of a wooden spoon and pour in more mixture, setting the pan back in the oven with the next layer of cake.









While they were set to bake he dolloped a decent amount of icing onto Eunice's first layer and spread it messily, but evenly. She may be growing to despise him, but he couldn't help his unconditional love that still stuck inside him. He would make sure everything was perfect. From the pink and white buttercream icing to the Barbie figurine candles that would be sitting on top.









He had two hours to finish and he was spreading his magic around in order to help him--he didn't think he could do it otherwise. Recesses of the chill inside what Tom called his core went about surrounding the confections. It couldn't fill them, or they would be too cold and Hari would be punished. The more disciplined part of his magic forced ribbons to tie into bows that looked like the instructions laid out for him to follow, hung them, and forced them to stick with flicks of Hari's wrist and a mental Lignum.









Ever since he first discovered just how massive his magic was, Hari had been working on disciplining it under Tom's tutelage. Tom had taught him that his magic wasn't simply his magic, it was its own entity that had bound itself to Hari. Magic was living, aware, and wild. The less control you had over it, the easier it was for spells to backfire or simply not work, and you would exhaust yourself trying to force your magic to comply.









The relationship between Magia and Magic was of mutual benefit, Tom taught.










'Magic comes from the Gods, who come from the One. Magic is a direct connection from them to us.'










Magic was a gift, he had explained. Magic went to devout followers, prophets, priests, and those whom prophecies foretold about in the Days Before Days. Magical creatures had been the pure creations of the Gods--followers, servants, companions, as Humans were to the One. Some Magia even believed that magic was the One.









However, over time humans gave in to corruption. As borders were established and Houses raised, the Era of Ends began. Forceful impregnation of those with magic, and those magical beings human enough to breed with led to the modern Magia, Magical Creatures, and those half-born to both such as vampires or veela.









The connection to the Gods was mostly lost, left to priests and priestesses that hid in families that would become parts of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, The Dynasties of Magical Creatures, and the 13 Divines. Through these dozens of families, magic thrived. The Gods were worshipped in varying altars, stories were passed down with godly artifacts, and everything was good.










Until Magia began labeling magic; declaring who should practice what and which magics were immoral. Gods became outlawed to worship, pantheons were broken up, Houses and families were divided. 






Light and Dark became two warring sides of the same entity. And magic wept.






People began declaring themselves Lords of the Dark and of the Light, seeking to conquer the world and force society to follow their own ideals. Dozens of wars broke out, millions of lives were lost, and magic declared no more.









Those who were evil in their hearts and souls, undeserving of the gift that was magic, had it ripped away from their very core. Magic deemed it to follow their descendents until granted a union between a cursed soul and a blessed one.









And thus the Muggles were born.









And a new side of war broke out.









In the beginning, Muggles were slow and barbaric and could be stopped with simple spells by the Magia. But they began to advance faster than the blessed could ever hope to. They built armor and weapons out of minerals from the earth, surging attacks onto small Magia communities and taking them over. It became known as the Witching Wars. 









Magia were forced to go into hiding, pushing spells that barely held together in order to keep their communities safe and hidden. All was well, for a while. Until a Dark Lord from Neapose decided he wanted to make the entirety of Eurasia his dynasty, and re-sprung the wars between Dark and Light while the rest of the Magic world attempted to keep themselves hidden from the Muggle one.









Tom had told Hari that the war of the Dark Lord Tian Zhihao had happened over several thousand years ago. Tom had also told Hari that the wizarding world was still fighting wars, but they were so disconnected that England believed they were not in one. Hari had thought that that was rather ridiculous.









A ping from the oven told Hari that his cupcakes were ready. The cake would probably take another five to ten minutes. For the time being till then, Hari would begin filling the goody bags that Petunia had counted and labeled. She was rather obsessed with showing off, Hari thought.









It didn't matter though; Hari would put up for it. For Eunice.









~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~









It was now January. Christmas break had come and went and Hari had never been more grateful than he was when school re-started. 









For you see, Hari had a new plan.









His year 3 teacher, Mr. Prichard, let out class for recess before lunch. This meant that Hari had a very tiny opportunity each day throughout recess to go inside for a ""bathroom break"", slip inside classroom 17B, and rifle through the lunch pails of his classmates.









It was the first day he had dared attempt such an act, originally being too fearful of the consequences of being caught both by his peers and his teacher. Then Christmas break came along, and the Dursleys stayed home on sundays, and Hari nearly starved to death. 









He first went to a metal superhero lunch pail under the cubby name of Michael. Michael was a scrawny kid with a mean attitude, who bullied Hari particularly nasty when tests were passed around. Hari had no problem stealing from him, and knew that Michael's mother always packed him several sandwiches that he bragged about.









Hari only took the slices of ham from the ham-and-cheese sandwiches, and the package of crackers before moving on.





He was carefully selective so that he had a lesser chance of being caught: half a bag of grapes from Amelia, an entire peanut-butter sandwich from Ben (because really, who needed two?), and as much water as he could hold from the boy's bathroom before running back outside.









He stayed hidden in the shadows as usual, skirting around the teachers whenever another student came too close, and revelled in his victory.









At first he felt horrible whenever he returned to Number Four about his actions. But when Petunia announced her pregnancy again and began stocking up on non-perishables, it became tradition. Very rarely were there food scraps in the trash or left on plates in the sink now, and Hari hated it. 





As weeks went by children began noticing more and more food went missing. Snacks they had secretly packed from their parents were no longer to be found in their backpacks. Food they witnessed guardians preparing turned up missing when they opened their lunchboxes, or substantially less than they remembered. Naturally, they went to the teacher. Suspicion began to fall on Hari, the little boy who never had a lunch bag to bring to school. Mr. Prichard, in a spectacle of kindness Hari had never seen, had pulled Hari aside at the end of March and asked him if he was the one responsible for the missing food. Hari had refused adamantly in the beginning, trying to cast blame on others, on anyone else than himself, but finally, tearfully gave in and told the older man the truth.









Mr. Prichard had called the Dursleys and told them what had been happening, and that perhaps they should pack a lunch for him to prevent such behavior in the future. Ms. Petunia had put on the perfect act, simpering into the phone about how jealous Hari was with Eunice and Dudley and now the baby that was on the way, and that she would make sure that Hari got to school with the lunches she packed. She even threw a few lines about how Hari had been picking on Dudley, and that she feared her boy may have been swiping his lunches as revenge.









Hari thought about walking into oncoming traffic on his way back as he heard Mr. Prichard and Ms. Petunia conversing over the speakerphone.





Hari was made to stay after class so his teacher and his guardians could have a small meeting. As he sat on the hard, plastic chairs of his classroom he wished his magic would suck him up like a black hole. Petunia and Vernon had come in the perfect picture of a loving, domestic couple. Petunia holding Eunice's small hand, her own free hand clutching suggestively around her stomach, Vernon having his arm gently wrapped around her lower back.









And there sat Hari; a small, dirty boy with a strange name and no parents who had just gotten caught stealing.





Mr. Prichard had set up two more ""adult"" chairs at his desk along with Hari's right beside him. When Vernon and Petunia took their seats, with Eunice in Petunia's lap, Hari prayed that the universe could just delete itself.









""Mr. And Mrs. Dursley,"" Mr. Prichard began slowly, expecting a warm first-name allowance by the couple. It was not given. He cleared his throat as moved on, faintly red-faced, ""I wanted to meet with you to call to your attention Hari's behavior lately.""









""Why don't we just pinch right to the point, Mr. Prichard?"" Petunia sighed. ""Hari's been thieving, and it's all our fault."" To Hari's confusion and utter horror, she began to sniffle.









""We've tried to raise him right these past two years, but--but--"" she cut herself off with a sob and leaned in to Vernon, who slipped his large arm around her and muttered comforting words into her ear.






  ""Oh good heavens, that's not what I meant to imply!"" Mr. Prichard groped around his necktie as beads of sweat began to collect on his temple. ""I understand it's difficult taking in a child that has a rather--different--background and you two are nothing but admirable for doing such a thing!"" He assured.










""I simply wished to discuss with Hari why he's been acting out, so that perhaps the issues at home would be solved along with the issues here at West Bridge.""









Petunia pulled out a delicate lace handkerchief and dabbed around her heavily made up eyes before wiping her nose. She gave Hari a very distinct look and asked him, ""Yes darling, why have you been acting out so?""









And all eyes were on him. He picked at the skin around his fingernails and gave a small shrug of his shoulders. Eunice surprised everyone by speaking up.









""'s jus' 'cause he's bad, that's why!""









Petunia placed a dragon-claw-like hand upon her daughter's brown hair. Hari could see Petunia's red nails beginning to twist in the curls and pull just hard enough to let off as a warning. Vernon's face began to redden as Mr. Prichard's attention was diverted to the small girl.









""What do you mean he's 'bad', honey?""









Eunice's hair was given a sharp but subtle tug as another warning. She would be punished if she got this answer wrong. Her and Dudley's punishments were never as bad as Hari's...but they still hurt.









""He--He breaks m' dolls suh'times. An--An' pulls m' hair.""









She thought it best to tell what Dudley did instead of Hari. When the grip on her hair was lessened, she knew she made the right choice and snuggled into her Mumma's chest.









""How long has this behavior been going on? You mentioned he had been picking on your son?"" Mr. Prichard gestured vaguely from Ms. Petunia to Hari and back again.









""I believe,"" she sniffled, ""I believe that it's been going on ever since we adopted him."" She put special emphasis on the word.









""Adopted? Oh, my, well--exactly what has Hari been doing?""









Petunia's eyes gleamed and she elbowed her husband. ""Oh I just couldn't--""









""He's been nothing but a menace! My Petunia is too soft on the boy, I say. He needs a strong military upbringing. He's always all over our boy Dudley, and he's begun to go after Eunice! Who's to say he wouldn't attack our baby when it comes?""









Mr. Prichard looked both shocked and a little puffed up. It was well known that Mr. Prichard had served in the military many years ago, and that he had a soft spot for other military men (despite the fact that Vernon had never served in a military of any sort).









He cast his eyes down to Hari and squared up his shoulders, attempting to look impressive in front of Mr. Dursley. ""Well, Hari, what do you have to say for yourself?""









Hari knew what the Dursleys wanted him to say. He was jealous. But he knew Mr. Prichard wouldn't believe him if he simply copied their words...but he would get in trouble if he didn't...









""I suppose I just want a family, sir. A real family."" Hari answered carefully. ""Dudley has a Mum and a Dad and a little sister and now another baby on the way and I'm...I'm just Hari.""









He made sure to kick his feet together and pick and his fingers. The more nervous he looked the more Mr. Prichard was likely to believe him.









His teacher looked at him with sad, pitying eyes. Hari hated the feeling.









""Hari I'm sure that if you tried, you'd find that you have family as well. You have wonderful guardians and siblings.""









Hari nodded morosely.









""Hari,"" he snapped his head up at Petunia. She had never addressed him before.









""We are trying, but we can't be your real family if you don't let us. Will you let us be your family Hari, and be a good boy?""









She gave him a sickly sweet smile and Hari new there was to be a new game.









""I'll be a good boy,"" he whispered, his gaze downcasted.









""That's all I needed to hear, darling.""

Searching for Something I Cannot Find


(Or rather, a Loss of Oneself)


Since the day that the Dursleys and Mr. Prichard had had their meeting, Petunia had become absolutely vicious. It was nothing compared to how she was before, as she even began withholding meals from the younger two children. When questioned by an angrily whining Dudley or an innocently curious Eunice, she would sneer and hiss to go ask it.  

Hari no longer was worthy of names, or direct addressment. Instead, Petunia began to refer to him as it. Vernon and the children soon followed suit.

When Petunia began withdrawing meals, the children began to blame it. Dudley would take advantage of his large size and strength and beat the freak until his knuckles hurt. Eunice was small, but smart. She decided to do things that could get him in trouble.

She knew that Mumma and Dadda made sure that  it never did any special nonsense, and Eunice had only witnessed this a few times. She could remember once that it made all the windows crack without touching them, just because Petunia had been disciplining her. So, she decided to tattle to her Mumma about all the nonsense that it would get up to, even if all of it had come from her head and both her and her Mumma knew it wasn't true.

It didn't matter, because her Mumma loved her.

And Hari, poor Hari, had become more depressed. He became uninterested in his books, and brushed off or even went as far as to silence Tom whenever he spoke up. He shut his magic away; He shut his feelings away; and Hari shut himself away.

School had become worse if possible, since beginning year 4. Children were beginning to become more physical in their attacks of him, and he didn't think it would take much longer before he was being cornered by others than Dudley. None of the teachers seemed to intervene, as all the boys seemed to back up each others stories. Even a nervous, bruised, bleeding Hari would attempt to fess up to tell the teachers it was his fault.

Even Ms. Priskit, now Mrs. Grindin, was no longer interested in Hari the troublemaker. At first, she had relayed her fears to Principal Henderson, but was alieved by Mr. Prichard, who proved that the Dursleys were good caretakers through his meeting with them and with the brown sack that now accompanied Hari to lunch every day.

No one suspected that Hari was being forced to vomit it up after school.

The first time Petunia had presented him with a simple paper sack, Hari had nearly laughed. She instructed him to take it with him to school, and apologize to Mr. Prichard for its lying. She had told him that this would cut into his debt and that he had better start looking for work.

During lunch he carefully unrolled the brown sack to reveal a single, plain cheese sandwich. He wolfed it down with a vengeance and had been begrudgingly grateful to Mr. Prichard for putting him in this situation in the first place.

When he returned back to what he now deemed the House, Hari was promptly led back to the bathroom. He had thought that the bath game waited for him, as Petunia had taken to using it quite often when issues of his nonsense arose or she felt that he had been particularly bad.

Instead, the bathtub was empty, and the toilet lid was up. She had shoved Hari to his knees in front of the bowl and and ordered him to vomit. Hari had tried to gag and cough the first few times, and Petunia had gotten fed up with how long he was taking.

She had ripped his head back by his black curls and forced her fingers down in his mouth. Her long, thick nails had scraped against his insides and Hari could faintly taste blood over the convulsing of his throat. When Petunia ripped out her fingers it was near instantaneous for Hari to retch into the bowl. It was horrid and acidic and faintly pink coloured, and when he coughed blood spattered against the inside of the toilet bowl.

She hadn't believed that that was the end, and when her fingers dug back into Hari's hair he couldn't help his reaction. His hands flung up and clawed at hers as he begged, ""Please, please, I can finish myself--I'll be good, I promise, I promise!""

He became a quivering mantra of half-gurgled, half-whimpered pleadings and promises to 

be good and to finish himself. When she stepped back, Hari became a sobbing mess of thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you. And then Hari had to reach his own tiny fingers in his mouth, past the point he was definitely comfortable with, and willed himself to jam his fingers even further back as far as he could. He wasn't as lucky as Petunia to pull his fingers out before he began be sick.

He was made to do it thrice more, each time trying harder and harder to pretend he couldn't taste the still-wet, sickly-sweet copper on his fingers, or that he couldn't feel the scrapes and gashes along the inside of his throat, or that he wasn't even in this situation at all. 

And each day, he believed his pretending a little less, and his horror became a little more real.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

As ordered, Hari had gotten odd jobs around the private community of Little Whinging; but most people wouldn't hire him because of his skin or his school record. Those that did paid him little, or ripped him off completely. The only exception was his beloved Ms. Figg, who would pay him simply for his time.

It became an odd sort of ritual for Hari, that after school and after his punishment, to stop by and check his usual houses for jobs before going off to Ms. Figg's. The only days that she may have been missing were Sundays, and she had told Hari that he was welcome during then anyway to keep away from the Dursleys.

Hari learned an awful lot about Ms. Figg in the time it took Petunia to birth one Mildred Claire Dursley between January 21st and May 29th. He learned that on Ms. Figg had used to be married to a man named Capricus Grom who had took her last name when they married. He learned that Ms. Figg was currently a squib, but hadn't been born one (something that had greatly shocked Tom).


Hari had learned that the same war that took her husband and permanently injured her son was also the same war that took her magic. Hari learned that Ms. Figg went to go visit Cristiano on Sundays, and that the good days were the days that he didn't recognize his mother. 

She didn't speak about the bad ones.

Hari had also began to learn much of the English wizarding world. He learned the currency, and its Muggle equivalence, and had begun to have been tutored by Ms. Figg in the basics of standard (and not-so-standard) wizard education, when Mildred had come along.


Hari became very grateful for the small hoards of pocket change he kept at Ms. Figg's when he was once again assigned baby duty. He became very grateful because Petunia's familial hunger game apparently extended towards her very nearly newborn baby, and had said that Hari would have to buy Mildred's formula itself. She had also offhandedly mentioned that if her child starved, Hari would have wished it had been him.

So Hari had begun a new ritual. His day began at 12-a.m, as Tom taught, and ended at 11:59-p.m. He would first stay up with Mildred in his cupboard for all hours of the day until school, rocking her quietly between his arms and soothing her with blanket-curls of magic. When he had to head to school he would wrap her up in the largest, cleanest shirt he had and set her in the makeshift cot of clothes overlaid with his old, cleaned dishrag. He would sleep through classes (his teachers had long since given up on him), before rushing home as fast as he could at the beginning of lunch to check on and care for Mildred, and rush back just in time for the end of recess. After school he would once again force his legs to run until they felt like they would burst to get back to the House, simply to check on and care for his baby again, and then took her with him when he went to Ms. Figg's.

He now went first to the woman who felt like his mother and dropped off Mildred before running back and forth between his usual houses, and some odd ones that sometimes offered him a job or two. Then he would go back to Mildred and Ms. Figg, and simply be. And they would be happy, most days of most weeks, for an hour a day. Until Hari had to return.

Hari could count on Ms. Figg spending money from his jar on things Hari thought of as essentials. She wrote down each cost of every item and how much it left Hari with (and if there was more boxes than were counted on the receipts and more money in Hari's jar, well Ms. Figg never said anything). Hari used Ms. Figg's spare bedroom as Mildred's storage room, under Ms. Figg's insistence.

Now, instead of a large, king sized bed there was a double twin bed shoved in the corner opposite the door, covered in quilts and pillows Ms. Figg had made herself. Instead of a lavish, corner-made China cabinet, there was now a proper crib for Mildred.

Instead of magically cleaned clothes that Hari still felt iffy about, there was now a beautiful redwood rocking crib with great fluffy cats carved into the head and baseboard. As months went by and Ms. Figg assured Hari that Mildred could process moving pictures, he made the cats move with an offhanded suggestion made by Tom.

And as Mildred became older and Hari taught her to smile and roll and hold up her head, he expected Petunia to take her from him. But she didn't. Instead she began preparing for Eunice's birthday and ordered Hari to stay out of the house longer than usual.

A week before Eunice turned three is when she caught Hari shushing a crying Mildred and singing to her. Eunice went stiff and simply watched as Hari cradled her baby sister and whispered over and over again that he loved her.

Mumma never held her like that.

Mumma never sang to her.

Mumma never told her that Mumma loved her...

Eunice felt jealousy roll up in her tummy as large, round tears made their way down her face much to her horror. She felt very much that she should be the one Hari was holding and singing to...and a faint whisper in her head said that maybe once she had been?

Her sniffles had caused Hari to whip his head around to face her so fast that for a moment Eunice was afraid for him that he may snap his neck right in two. And then he looked at her...like he looked at Mumma. 

""Please, please, please don't tell, Eunice--Mil-Mildred's sick and I--I can't get her to calm down, please, I'm sorry.""

Here he was...begging her...like he begged Dudley when Dudley hit him. Like she begged Dudley when he decided to hit her. Tears swept down her face faster than before and she brought up her hands to try to choke back her whimpering.

""Why--why doesn't my Mumma l-love me like--like that?""

The mirror in the bathroom began to quake and crack and Eunice was afraid that Hari might punish her for speaking ill about her Mumma. She was very surprised when instead of a sharp slap across the face that usually left shallow cuts, she was engulfed in thin arms and squished against a flat chest and a warm bundle.

""Hey, it's okay...""

And then he was singing to her. Singing to her and holding her like she was precious to him. And she no longer had quite sobs, and neither did Mildred, and they were happy.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













When Eunice began to purposely cause up trouble in the hopes that her mother would send her with Hari, Hari thought his heart would stop. She would push over expensive vases, rip up flowers in the garden, and spill food, all within sight of her mother or when she was the only logical culprit.













Even when the backs of her legs began to permanently adopt shades of purples and yellows, some with blistering welts that oozed pus if she scratched them, Eunice persisted. She would purposefully muss up her Mumma's makeup and stain her nice clothes with food, or misplace her Mumma's nice jewelry, and even nicked through her purse once. It never mattered much to Eunice, since when she came limping to Hari's cupboard he would hold her (and let her hold Mildred) and sing the Horse song to her and use what he called magic to make her hurts go away.













And Eunice had become very attached to Hari, and very attached to Mildred, whom she now addressed as Millycat. When Mildred would cry in the cupboard with Hari, Eunice would sing the Horse song that Hari had been teaching her to calm Millycat down. Hari had told her that his Mumma sang it to him when he was a baby. It made Eunice feel very special.













Sometimes during the Horse song, when it was late at night, Hari would even make horses. He could make tiny horses that looked like they were made from the fireplace-smoke gallop around the small enclosure, whinny quietly, and even nuzzle the young girls.













It was Dudley's tenth birthday on June 23rd that Eunice was caught talking to it  by their Aunt Marge.













Marjorie Nelson-nee-Dursley had seldom come around Little Whinging, both due to her dislike of Petunia and her intense hatred of Hari. When she did visit, she always made sure to bring her current dog who she had trained to have an intense distrust for coloured people. Since Razor had died four years ago, she decided to keep his best son as her new breeding male, and he was completely brutal.













Hari had no fond memories of what he knew was his Aunt Marge. The first time he had met her (that he could remember) was when he had been a little older than three at Dudley's fifth birthday. Dudley had demanded that Hari join him and his best friend Piers Polkiss in a game of musical chairs. Hari was quicker, however, and won most of the games. In retaliation, Mrs. Nelson had whipped around Hari's legs with her walking cane for humiliating Dudders at his birthday! Later that day she had sent Razor after him, and Hari ended shut up in his cupboard, crying, while the beastly bulldog clawed and snarled outside his flimsy door. She had decided to stay over the weekend, and Hari was not allowed out while she was inside the house, and dare not venture outside when he believed Razor would be waiting for him.













She had only visited during Dudley's seventh, ninth, and now tenth birthday, all due to Dudley's incessant pleading. Hari was rather grateful to whomever kept her from visiting regularly, and thought he couldn't possibly have hated the woman more. That was until she caught Eunice telling Hari a silly joke she had learned off the telly.













Marge had ripped both of them up by their arms and dragged them to the kitchen, to report to Vernon in front of Petunia what she had seen. That Eunice had been talking to it, joking and laughing with it.













Hari had had Mildred ripped away from him moments later, and had had Eunice taken away all over again. He was forced to watch as Eunice was disciplined by Aunt Marge and her cane. Eunice, in turn, was forced to lay whimpering on the floor as Marge and Petunia punished Hari. She couldn't have moved, even if she had felt like she deserved to. When Vernon decided to punish Hari, and invited Dudley to help, Eunice became very ashamed of herself.













Eunice became very ashamed because she turned away from Hari, whose dull dull dull eyes stared at her like her dolls did, and she simply shut her eyes and clapped her hands over her ears.













Hari wasn't supposed to look like that.













Hari wasn't supposed to sound like that.













Hari wasn't dull or lifeless; her Hari was warm and loving and so so so full of hope. 













And his screams began permeating through her poor barriers and she simply screwed her eyes shut tighter and clamped her hands down harder against her ears.













--broken, hurting, because of her.













It seemed like a very long time to Eunice before Hari stopped screaming. It was even longer when his silence stretched on and the curses that flew from her relatives' mouths and the muted thumps of fists against flesh echoed around her skull. Tears leaked from her eyes when they finished with Hari and she was suddenly scooped up into large arms, shushing her.













Her Dadda pat her back and told her that they disciplined her because they loved her and that it was necessary. Eunice nodded into his shoulder and watched Hari's form soak up more of the dark, growing puddle beneath him from over her Dadda's back.













Eunice broke down that night, for Hari, and told herself that she deserved each bruise blossoming on her skin for getting him in trouble.













She whispered the melody of Hari's horse song, and cried herself to sleep.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













Hari had been left in the kitchen when Mr. Vernon had gathered up Eunice. He couldn't bring himself to be worried over her, or himself, or angry, or anything.














All Hari knew was pain, and even that began to fade out with the sleep that tugged at him.













 'Do not fall asleep!' 













But sleep sounded wonderful and Hari hurt so much.













 'Hari if you fall asleep you will die.' 













That sounded nice, Hari supposed. If he died, he wouldn't hurt anymore, and he could probably sleep all he wanted.













Hari's mind was suddenly filled with thousands of overlapping buzzes, complete with sharp, mental prods that Hari equated much to stingers. He shifted on to floor, groaning when his mouth met a silky, coppery-tasting substance that seemed to stain his face.













Hari hadn't known a person could bleed that much...














'Hari, wake up! Now!'














And his body was forcibly lurched against Hari's own willing. He watched, fascinated, as his hands began to spasm and plant themselves on the floor, pushing him up. Hari didn't make them do that...in fact, now that he thought about it, he was even losing feeling in his arms, and now his legs.













He felt bones forcibly snap back into place. When they couldn't set themselves automatically, Hari was left with joints grinding against each other that caused him terrible amounts of pain.













His body got up without Hari's consent. Every action was made without Hari's order, awkwardly making his way toward his cupboard. He looked like a puppet with tangled strings being dragged towards his destination, and dropped like one with its strings cut once inside.













His whole body felt like burning hot needles were being pushed inside excruciatingly slow. Over the mind-numbing pain that filled Hari's mind he could barely make out Tom's desperate I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. 













Then his back was arching, nearly snapping in half. Blinding agony swept through him and Hari swore even his hair hurt.













He could barely make out shapes in the darkness, his eyes blurring together and being overcome with fantastical colours. They grew in his vision, in all shapes and hues, and took over any light that was visible to him. 













And then, all the sudden, everything was dark, and Hari was no longer aware.













He could faintly feel consciousness brushing his dreams of having tea with Ms. Figg, with a tiny brunette girl in a pretty pink dress taking up the green armchair and cooing at newborn kittens. The image was thin, like dust, waiting to be reshaped into a room Hari had been getting to know all-too-well. There was a bed full of homemade quilts and pillows against the far wall, and opposite it was now a bunk bed. The top tier had sheets of faint pink and the bottom of cool yellows.













His pain faded away with the dust of ever-changing scenes of Hari and his girls at Ms. Figg's, having tea parties or singing or showing them magic-- 













And in his dreams, Hari was happy. They ended far too soon for his liking, and began slipping away quicker than Hari would have preferred (Hari would have liked to hold on to them forever, but.....) He fought against his consciousness, as much as he could, desperate to stay in his dreams. But alas, he failed, and woke to something he much more readily would have believed was a dream.













At the time that Hari had awoken, he began panicking at the holes in his vision. They were like tiny pinpricks of swirling stars in random patterns scattered throughout what was left of his sight. They didn't necessarily obscure what he could see, more like pin-sized black holes sucking in everything around it. When he tried to focus on one or the other, they grew. Translucent light spiderwebbed from them, connecting each star together before merging into one. One that opened. It was like a greater version of opening his eyes--watching it split open like an eye all its own and reveal a whole other world.













It looked almost like the space cartoons Hari caught glimpses of on the telly when he cleaned; swirls of deep, aware colours that varied in hues Hari knew and ones that Hari could never imagine. He could feel the consciousness from the world in front of him, laughing at him affectionately.








""Such a promising child,"" a voice, an eerie mix of Ms. Figg and Lily, seemed to resonate from the space. ""Yet such pain lies ahead of you...""














It seemed to contemplate, the silks of its being--her being?--ruffled like Ms. Petunia's curtains in the breeze.













""I suppose you'll do,"" It teased, pushing him back out of the expanse gently. ""Awake now, child, for I fear the alternative is quite unfavourable."" 













It confused Hari, for wasn't he awake now? But then he watched as the spiderwebs reappeared throughout the eye he was looking through and closed, reforming the stars that afflicted his vision beforehand.













And then they seemed to blur out of his perception. If he focused he could still take notice of some of them, but they no longer directly distracted him. He rubbed his hands against his eyes to try to dislodge the remaining ones, if he even could, only to freeze when he felt up along his scar. His scar had grown. Now it wasn't such a strange concept to Hari, since when he was four it barely stretched across half of his forehead and the last time he had seen it in Ms. Figg's fancy bathroom mirror it had been running down and beginning to intercept his right eyebrow. Now, however, he could feel it past his eyebrow and working its way around his eye.













Anxiously Hari traced the raised skin to where he knew it would end, or rather, where he thought it would end. Instead of grazing just at his hairline, now it extended in a slow curve that started to aim at his ear. Hari was horrified.













He had an inkling that his scar-growth was tied to the now absolutely giant mindscape Tom who gleamed a deep, lake-muck green, punctuating with what resembled black eyes along his body. His head was now the length of Hari's head and torso, and over twice as thick. His body could of easily swallowed Vernon, and while Hari was happy that his friend was getting better, he was fearful of what his friend did in order to cause his scar and Tom's mental body to grow at such a rate in such little time.













Hari began to think that perhaps his companion, Tom, was more than he was letting on.

Mother, May I?


(Or rather, Dreams are Dreams are Dreams)


Tom only raised more questions than he gave answers when Hari had asked him what he did. 'A blood ritual, of sorts I suppose...'  He had said, but even he seemed unsure.


'I called upon several Gods, asking them for their favour, to save your life. One seemed to answer.'


Tom had then pondered exactly which of the apparent twenty-odd Celestials he had called on could have healed Hari.

'I suppose it could have been Cerridwen...she is a Mother God, or Goddess I suppose,'  he corrected when he sensed Hari's confusion, 'Yet she is considered a Dark Goddess, and would have little to do with intervening in someone's death.'

He had listed off several others, such as Danu, Durga, Amaterasu, Hera, or even Gaia, whom Tom claimed seldom interfered with earthly affairs.

'Well...she sounded like Lily and like Ms. Figg?' Hari had tried.


'Mother Goddesses often will. That is, sound like those you see as a maternal guardian. What did she look like?'


Hari was rather surprised. After all, Tom was in his head, so shouldn't that mean that he should have been able to see her too? Hari half thought he may have been losing his grip on reality, because these things simply didn't happen to normal people. Normal people couldn't rip open nothing and see into space. Normal people didn't have complete other people in their heads. But...He thought back to the silk-like textures inside the other world. The other world that apparently was inside his mind. He wouldn't give that up, even if it meant sanity. Her voice, that sounded so much like Lily and so much like Ms. Figg...the way the energy inside, the very world itself pushed him gently, like a mother ushering forward her child.


'She didn't look like anything...it was all colours and stars, like outer space.'


Tom was silent for a moment. 'There is a high chance that you ventured into the outer reaches of her realm.'


'...what?'


Tom scoffed, as if Hari should know this. 'Every Celestial has a realm, where they decide to build their kingdom. Where they hold their powers, like Heaven would be for Yahweh. It is--not another dimension--but another layer upon reality. Each realm is connected to the Spirit Worlds, and followers of Gods usually venture from there to their Patrons' domain.'


'So...I was in this God's realm?'



'Not quite. You were more standing outside the door of the realm, or caught between the walls. You were inside the bridge that connects there, by her allowance.'


Well, at least it made sense to why everything looked like it was barely held together. Hari just wondered if the actual ""inside"" would look better...

'How could I get there anyway? Can anyone go?' Hari meant Magia, and nearly smacked himself for his mistake. When he wasn't specific, he usually got long lectures about information he hadn't wanted in the first place.


'Yes and no. Followers can go to their specific Gods realms. Magia and Muggles can visit only after death or by being chosen. Priests of Gods, or chosen ones such as Prophets or the Favoured, can visit at will after being trained how. In the Spirit World, spirits can roam anywhere they please, unless banned or held by a specific God.'


Muggles could go to a God's realm? Hari supposed it made sense, since they were descended from Magia in the first place...but still.


'So...she saved me because I'm chosen?'



'No. She saved you because when I called out, offering your services in exchange for not dying, she took an interest. She saved you because in that moment she chose you.'


'You offered what!?' He was going to be a slave? Not only to some no-good obscenities that Ms. Figg would definitely not approve of Hari using, but now to some God that Hari didn't even know?


'Your services. Such as becoming a Champion or a Priest.'


Oh. Well, that didn't sound too bad. Hari vaguely recalled a Champion being someone who was rather like a knight, and he knew a Priest was someone that taught and ministered a church. He pondered a bit--if his new Patron, he supposed, was a Mother Goddess, then there couldn't be too many looking to fight her, right?

'Oh. So all I have to do is defend her honor or whatever, or ""spread her word""?' The sarcasm was heavy on his tongue. He had learned that particular phrase from the church shows Ms. Petunia enjoyed watching on Sundays and Wednesdays. Hari doubted he could ever take himself seriously again if he began speaking like the men on those shows.


'Not quite. You would fight in her name, in whatever role she chooses. If she chooses you to be a Knight, then you will slay her enemies as you can. If she chooses you to be a Healer, you would fight the wars on sickness; injustice for the sick, prejudice against the hopelessly diseased, and your weapon would be cures instead of curses. If she chooses you to be a Necromancer, you will do so; communing with the deceased and assisting those who need it.'



'And I could do that or be a Priest?'


'No,' Tom shifted inside his head, almost like a silent sigh, 'You would become that and a Priest. Since she actually took the time to save your life, I would think that it may be one of the Minor Goddesses in a pantheon, one with not many followers. Therefore, she needs both.'

'Oh.' Well then. Hari preferred the idea of becoming a Healer, since he wasn't too big on killing anyone, or even thought he could give Necromancy a try (even if he absolutely wasn't scared of ghosts, thank you very much). He thought back to ""You'll do"" from the being he now knew to address as female. She said he would do, but what exactly would he do for?


'Can I ask her? What I want to be, I mean.'



'I suppose you could, if you contacted her. You would need to know her name first.'


Hari huffed through his nose. He did that quite a lot when he was irritated.


'Well if you hadn't asked so many of those--Gods or whatevers--then I would know her name.'


Hari felt Tom sulk around in his head, scales flaring out slightly like Snowy's fur when she was angry. There were low, sarcastic hisses emanating from the back of Hari's head. Well, if Tom wanted to pout, so be it. It was his fault anyway.


'Oh yes, thank you Tom for saving my life. Oh no, no really, thank you for going out of your way to save me. And thank you so much for going out of your way to teach me.'


Hari giggled quietly to himself. Tom often did this, mocking Hari or trying to guilt trip him. He always apologized later, but he was entertainingly antagonistic.


'Oh please, you know you'd die of boredom if you didn't teach me.'


And then there were scales absolutely bristling against his mind. He tried to muffle his laughter behind his hands. Oh, now Tom would pout for a while, but it was worth it.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

After Tom had finished throwing his fit, he finally told Hari that there was a way to narrow down which Goddess had chosen him, and then figure out exactly which one it was through trial and error. Apparently, all Hari had to do was meditate and build his Occlumency shields and his Legilimency skills. Tom explained that they were mind magics and that Hari had already been subconsciously practicing them, both with his communication with Tom and in learning how to escape to his mindscape.

However, he would have to delve deeper into his mind through meditation and contact that world again, pulling it into his mind and trying to decipher it. That was where Legilimency came into play. He would have to sort of read the Goddess's mind, something that Hari thought was a very bad idea. Tom assured him that since she was a Goddess, no one could slip in undetected and certainly not without her permission. It wouldn't even be the actual mind reading--it would be more like interpreting, Tom said.


'Besides, it'll be fun! I've never done this before.'


That certainly reassured Hari. Reassured him more that he was going to be smote by a pissed off Goddess more than anything, but he supposed it count.

So that's what they did, for months. When Hari was locked away in his cupboard--they meditated. When Hari was lying incapacitated after punishment--they slipped away to his mindscape. At night, when Hari was supposed to be sleeping--he found that even if he had mentally been awake all night, physically he wasn't exhausted.

The more they practiced the more changes Hari would notice about himself. His magic, at first wild and free and only partially domesticated like a lion that was no longer hungry, was now soft but strong. It prowled around Hari like a large predator, waiting. It came to his call near instantly, with or without verbal orders to direct it. While he couldn't quite reach the world again, he could spread open the stars in his sight to catch glimpses and tastes of her magic.

And oh, was it intoxicating.

It felt like being wrapped up by Ms. Figg and being back inside his mother's womb and being filled with love. It was Ms. Figg's tea that was terribly sweet and the song he remembered just barely, the way that Ms. Priskit use to smile at him and give him sparkling stickers and blue.



'Her eyes are blue.'



'What?'



'Her eyes--the Goddess--they're blue.'


Tom seemed flabbergasted, for he didn't say anything the next moment. There wasn't even any movement in Hari's head before,


'That--That's literally nothing. Absolutely--I mean absolutely--phenomenally useless information.'


Hari decided to use his newly found Occlumens shields to drown out and silence his companion. Now that Hari could choose whether or not to listen to Tom's toddler-like tirades, Hari often chose not to. Trust Tom to ignore that Hari had finally made progress and discovered something about the Goddess in the seven months they had been practicing, all in favour of scolding him about how useless it was.

Ignoring the muted banging against his walls, which was probably a hissy-fitting Tom angry that Hari wasn't listening to him pitch, Hari chose to delve back into his mindscape. It had changed from the castle expansion that Tom had originally created, and now featured a duplicate of Ms. Figg's house in a partial rainforest. Inside were mental projections of Ms. Figg, Eunice, and a growing Mildred, along with each of Ms. Figg's strange-looking cats. They didn't do much, merely said what Hari remembered one of them saying now or then or what Hari imagined they would say, and the cats butt their heads against all the furniture and loved the girls. All in all, it became Hari's happy place.

It also became the only grasp of Ms. Figg Hari now had, as since that day he had been banned from going out again. If the neighbors wanted his work, they would come directly to the Dursley's, who would charge quite a bit of money. It drove many customers away, and attracted several creepy ones that Hari despised working for. Just in case, Tom gave him a few curses if one of them tried anything. Even though none of them hadn't so far, Hari was still wary.

It only made his ventures to his mindscape more meaningful, and filled him with determination to do better. It drove him to work harder, to push himself past his limits and absolutely exhaust himself.

Ms. Figg gave him tastes of freedom, love, and family, completed by Eunice and Mildred. Hari had these things in his grasp, and he was not willing to give them up. Hari had just been surviving for so long, but now--Hari wanted to live.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It was June once again; Mid-June to be exact. It was to be Dudley's birthday in a mere five days, and Petunia was antsy. Marjorie had agreed to come for a visit, which would make the odd three year visit in a row, and stay until the end of July. Hari was, decidedly, not thrilled.

Customers had been shooed away from renting Hari so that he could clean the house until he absolutely ached. Instead of mopping the two--technically four--story house, Hari was ordered to scrub it with a dishrag. Instead of the usual downstairs and upstairs, he had to scrub the attic, the basement, and even the garage. Hari thought it all rather ridiculous, but kept that to himself and Tom. He polished silverware after hand washing it and running it through the dishwasher, waxed the wooden furniture in the house that could be waxed, and vacuumed daily since the beginning of June.

It was a nonstop process of constant cleaning. From the time Hari awoke to the time he exhausted himself into his mindscape, or actually slept, Ms. Petunia would find busywork for him to do. 


""Clean the gutters!""



""Weed the garden!""



""Mow the yard!""


Even if he had done it all a week, a few days, or even a single day before, Petunia persisted. By the 17th of June, Hari was left feeding his magic into the soil of the gardens to prevent the plants from looking completely mangled and spreading it throughout the yard to boost the growth of the grass simply so he could shave it half a hair. It stretched his magic more than he ever had and left him worn out, but it gave Hari a rush. To feel his magic seep into each plant and wrap around it, threading through it, was a feeling like nothing Hari had ever experienced. He could almost feel their pulse of life, their own brand of magic, and it was  fascinating.

Tom told him that what Hari was doing was called Chloromancy--Garden or Green Magic--and wasn't altogether surprised that it came easy to Hari. Tom went as far as to suggest that so might the other elemental magics, since Hari had such a large magical core. He did warn Hari that having a large core was not a get-out-of-studying-free card, as just because they came easily to him did not mean that he was naturally proficient. His grumbling made Hari smile to himself, mouthing after him outside his head where he knew Tom wouldn't be able to see.


'I can feel you mocking me.'


Hari laughed. It was the last time he would for a while, since Mrs. Nelson arrived at Number Four of Privet Drive the next morning.

Marjorie Nelson was imposing as before, with clothes a size or few too small stretched around her stout frame unflatteringly. She wielded her cane like a weapon, even giving Hari's door a good whack! as she passed it.

""Boy! Get my luggage!""

Inside, Hari flinched violently. He thought he would wait until she was a safe distance away to creep out, but Marge had other plans.

""Boy, get out here and get my luggage!""

Multiple thwacks hit against his door so hard Hari feared it would break. He slowly reached to push it open with shaky hands, but was too late as the door was ripped open and a furious Marge was revealed on the other side. Her face reddened much like how Vernon's did, and Hari could practically see the steam rising from her head. He was grateful that her short, large arms couldn't fit in his cupboard to grasp him--not that she didn't try.

Hari knew that it would only get worse if he didn't get out, but he also knew the moment he did Marge would grab him. He made a decision: using his magic to subtly push her arm just past him, he slipped around her and pressed himself against the opposite wall, chin tucked tightly against his chest.

He felt more than saw as she whipped around his direction, pushing her face into his and puffing hot, unpleasant breaths against Hari's cheeks. Marge seized his throat with her thick fingers.

""Listen here, boy,"" she hissed venomously, spittle flying from her lips, ""If you try to make a fool of me you'll be finding yourself sorely mistaken. I'll have Vernon throw you out faster than Ripper can tear through your legs. Now go--get--my--luggage.""

She threw him against the floor and stomped off, causing the floor and the walls to shake with each heavy step until she was safely away from the entrance room. Hari fought back the urge to groan when he forced himself up, choking back coughs and wheezes. He rubbed at his neck tenderly and tiptoed across to the door, careful not to make a noise in case it brought upon the wrath of another one of the elder Dursleys.

Parked outside in the driveway (right behind where Petunia's car would come out, Hari noticed) was Marge's silver BMW. He could see Ripper clawing at the front window, stepping over smaller bags to bark and snap at Hari. For now, Hari avoided the front and chose to unload the trunk. He would save the interior for last, to see if he could trick Ripper into the back yard before earning another bite mark on his leg.

It took him three trips, even with magic, to empty out the trunk. He decided to set them in a small pile beside the door in the entrance room, something he would probably be punished for later, but he didn't know which room Marge had insisted on taking and he certainly wasn't intent on asking. Before he took his chances with Ripper, Hari decided to put up a barrier between the front and back seats and stuff as many suitcases he could carry in his arms before slamming the door and dropping the charm. This process took four trips, and then it was time for Ripper.

Hari flattened himself out along the door and yanked it open, pulling himself up over the car door and onto the roof safely away from the dog that was currently in a mad frenzy. The white bulldog pounced along the car, leaving small scratch marks along the front side and the leather interior of the door, snapping at Hari and howling like a wild beast. Hari, in turn, eyed the gate at the very corner of the house and split himself off the hood. He ran like he was possessed, with Ripper hot on his heels, before slamming into the locked gate and screaming when he felt sharp teeth sink their way into his left leg. He forced the gate to open with his magic, practically causing the lock to explode, before kicking Ripper inside and tugging back his metal safety net. Ripper was whimpering and licking his paw, but Hari had little sympathy with his heavily bleeding leg. He twisted around to gauge the damage and breathed a sigh of relief when it was only somewhat deep. No skin was left hanging, and he could probably heal it quite easily later...or perhaps even now?

He had been using his magic quite a bit. Even though it wasn't enough to put much of a dent in it, but healing himself, especially forcing skin to grow back in such a short period of time, took a lot out of him. Hari decided to risk it. He channeled his magic into his leg, focussing on interweaving it into the areas that were currently oozing blood at an uncomfortable rate. He felt it begin to sting, and his skin begin to grow back, before he stopped, completely out of breath. When he looked back at it he saw that there were tiny scabs surrounding the area, but it hadn't healed much at all.

He tried again.

And again.

And again.

Four times, until he was sure it wouldn't work and spent the last of his magic forcing it to stay, holding his breath until he was red in the face. And finally, finally, the back of his leg was covered in infected-looking scabs that no longer bled. Well---he would deal with that later. Hari limped back to the car and finished unloading the front and, as expected, once inside he was ripped up by his throat again by Mrs. Nelson for leaving out her things.

He never noticed the small elf owl that sat perched in the tree of the front yard, watching him unblinkingly the whole time.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Marjorie had stayed until the second week of September. During that time, Hari walked on eggshells when he was allowed outside his cupboard and threw himself in harm's way when he saw Marge's rage begin to single in on one of the younger girls, or even, to Hari's surprise, Dudley. He didn't quite understand why he was protecting Dudley, especially when it often ended in said boy joining in on his punishment, but he could feel that the alternative to leave him was definitely not good.

He had been ripped up out of school, with the claim that Petunia was sick and she needed all the help she could get, and was left to fend for himself from Dudley's birthday till Marjorie left. Thanks to Marjorie, Hari had been gifted a pair of Vernon's old glasses. His stars had become more and more numerous, and Hari hadn't quite figured out how to make them go away completely, which resulted in him bumping into things and slamming into walls or doors that he nearly couldn't see. However, he had to be somewhat grateful, since the stars seemed to refract off of the glass within the frames just enough that Hari could make his way about in the unfocused world.

 The prescription made his eyes hurt and gave him horrible headaches, but Hari supposed it was better than nothing.

And now, with his new gift, Hari was being forced back to school. He would be a week late, with Petunia's illness that suddenly seemed to have afflicted her, and be forced into Mr. Osturbur's 5th year homeroom. Apparently Marge had specifically requested him since Mr. Osturbur dealt mainly with the delinquent children, and had no problem punishing as needed.

What was even better about him was that he was part of the expansion program. West Bridge had decided that they needed to split first through third year and fourth through sixth year into two separate buildings. Both Petunia and Hari were gleeful; Petunia would now no longer have to provide Hari a lunch, and Hari could attempt to sneak food from his classmates again.

Hari soon found out that Mr. Osturbur may have been even more vile than Marjorie Nelson herself. Apparently Officer Osturbur had been a high commanding officer in Her Majesty's Royal Army, and had chosen to retire many years ago. He told them believed in corporal punishment, and brought out a long, thin ruler-like instrument with small holes drilled through it and set it on his desk. Hari would learn exactly how Mr. Osturbur planned to use it.

Long sleeves were prohibited in class; either you rolled them up or wore a sleeveless shirt. Talking out of turn ended you with a single lash across the inside of your arm. Disrespect earned you three lashes. Bad grades earned you five. If you were unlucky enough to be picked out as an example, ten lashes would be delivered across your arms.

When he came back to the House with welted arms, the only sympathetic looks he gained were from Eunice, who was still too ashamed to talk to him. Vernon usually looked at him snidely when he caught glimpses of the harsh, red marks. Dudley had made it a habit to wrench Hari's arm by the wounds and use them to drag Hari around, particularly at the schoolyard to impress other children (particularly Piers Polkiss).

He had stopped temporarily after one particular oddity.

Dudley and his gang, consisting of Piers Polkiss, Michael Owens, and Zachary Dux, had been chasing Hari in their new game called Hari Hunting. The object of the game was to see who could catch Hari first. Whoever did got to either beat him up or throw him off of the top of the monkeys or the jungle-gym. 

Piers Polkiss was the thinnest of the lot--lanky and gangly and all limbs. He was blonde, had rat-like features, and fast. Hari had to push to be faster, usually running into another child or Michael.

Where Dudley was rather large in one way, Michael was large in the other. At eleven years old the redhead was more muscular than any of the children Hari had so far encountered. His favourite thing to do was to see how many times he had to stomp on Hari's arm before it would bleed.

Zachary was more or less the groupie of the gang. He was shorter than the other, not thin or large in any way, and not very fast. Usually he would just twist up his dog-face into a grin when one of the boys caught Hari, and try to join in then.

Yet out of all of his friends, Dudley seemed to be the one who caught him the most. Hari didn't think any of the others were holding back, since Dudley seemed to enjoy watching them beat up Hari as much as doing it himself. He even got a few licks in for good measure when he felt like it after the victor was done, if it wasn't him.

But Dudley would just...appear. He never seemed shocked, always waiting for Hari to realize he had just been chased into him, and never let Hari get away. He would be hiding in dark corners, or in the shade of trees, or even in groups of other children that Hari tried to hide in--just waiting. It scared Hari.

It had rained the week before and recess had been cancelled, much to Hari's relief. However, the head teachers thought it unfair to the children that they miss a whole week, and decided to extend recesses of the next week to cover lunch as well, so children could picnic outside. It was on the third day of Dudley's extended Hari Hunting session that it happened.

He was running into the middle of a group of children, desperate to hide if even for a moment. He knew he wouldn't get very long, since Piers was the one after him. But then, when Hari caught sight of the familiar too-sharp nose and malicious grin, Hari disappeared.

It felt like he had been hooked by another one of Vernon's fishhooks, this time behind his navel. It tugged him through a tube that felt like it was squishing Hari through a straw--overly suffocating and terribly claustrophobic. As it ended, Hari chanced a look around. There was no more grass, and he was sitting on something rather grainy and uncomfortable. It looked like a large, odd shape holding lots of crushed up rocks, with metal structures coming out of it like he had seen on some of the roofs in Little Whinging.

The roofs.

He was on the roof.

The middle of the roof, to be exact.

A small hoo? left Hari flinching, trying to find the direction of the noise. Almost directly behind him on his right was a small, golden-and-black owl. It's eyes were rather abnormally large even for an owl, and Hari thought that maybe he had shocked the poor thing.

'Flitwick?' Tom seemed rather shocked.


'Flitwick? What's a Flitwick?'


Tom seemed to think about how he should answer. 'It's him. He is an animagus--do not let him know that you know.'

Hari made a soft hum inside his head before gently reaching his hand out to the bird--well, the man-turned-bird. If he was to pretend that Flitwick really was an owl, then he supposed it was correct to treat him like one.

""Hey, it's okay--I didn't scare you did I?"" Hari put on his best remorseful look, which wasn't very difficult since he really did feel bad about scaring the owl. A soft hoo was his reply, along with a ruffle of feathers. Hari took that to mean no, or at least not too terribly.

Hari approached the bird with his hand out, keeping it at a low level in case his advances weren't welcome. Flitwick seemed to appraise his hand with a curious look, before dipping his head into the callused palm.


'I'm surprised he allowed you to touch him. If I recall correctly, he found the act of being pet demeaning. It's one of the reasons he and Minerva argue so much.'



'Minerva?'



'Another teacher. Her animagus is a cat. When students are--not in a good place--she transforms and allows herself to become a comfort animal.'



'How do you know this?'


Tom was silent, and Hari might have taken it for embarrassment if not for the icier feeling in his head. A small hoot redirected Hari's attention to Flitwick, and he gently scratched around the bird's feathers. He wondered if this was like preening. 

""Where did you come from, bird? I mean, owls don't really go out in the daytime,"" Hari asked. He didn't really expect an answer, but it was nice to use his voice again. Just as Hari thought, all he received was a ruffle of feathers that displaced his hand in reply.

Hari stayed with Flitwick for the rest of the school day before being fetched by one of the teachers whom had been looking for him.

""Will you be here tomorrow?"" Hari asked, anxious that the hope wasn't too obvious in his voice.

Flitwick looked at Hari, directly into his eyes, and dipped his head. Hari took that as a promise.

Three Headed Snake


(Or rather, Useful Information)


Flitwick had made good on his promise. He came nearly every day to visit Hari beginning in the library during the chilly season of late fall. During the first part of recess, Hari would slip out and sprint towards the double doors of the new Northwest Bridge Upper Elementary Library. Once inside, he would slink around to the smallest table in the darkest corner that he had made his niche. On his days without Flitwick, Hari would work on his basic education, even humouring when Tom gave him assignments. On his days with Flitwick, Hari would force open the locks of the windows so Flitwick could flutter inside, and he, in turn, would find a comfortable perch.

During their times together, Hari would grab books from all sections--the fourth year section, the fifth year section, the sixth year section, and even the gifted and talented section and read them aloud. He adopted the habit of reading aloud softly to the man-bird, thinking it rude if he simply ignored him the whole time. Flitwick never seemed to mind. If anything, Hari's voice lulled him to sleep.

Hari was never offended by this. In the beginning he may have been a bit perplexed at why the man was spending time with him when he was so tired, but Tom told him that Flitwick probably wasn't falling asleep on purpose.


'They're just getting over a war. He was a great part in the Light Resistance, and now is most certainly a great part in helping to rebuild.'



'The Light Resistance? He's a Dark Wizard?'



'I wouldn't be able to tell you if he was--and not all Dark Magia are evil. And no--the Light Resistance was the Resistance of the Dark, led by a mostly unanimously voted Light Leader to fight against the most recent English Dark Lord.'


So Hari was content to allow Flitwick to curl his beak to his fluffy chest and go to sleep. When he did, Hari would continue reading, just in case Flitwick woke. The only day he ever dared to wake Flitwick was when he was reading the Chronicles of Narnia and found a name that was safe to call Flitwick instead of simply 'hey you,' or 'bird.'

""Hey bird--wha'd'ya think of Glim?""

Flitwick merely fluffed his feathers and craned his head towards Hari.

Hari huffed. ""Well, it's better than just bird.""

Flitwick let out a small coo and clicked his beak together before beginning to preen under his wings. From then on, Hari referred to Flitwick as Glim. It made him feel like he had an actual friend instead of just talking to a bird.

During the late fall and early winter of 1990, Hari and now Glim stayed within the solitude of their corner, away from prying eyes. From September to November, Hari had read everything from Narnia to its fanfiction the Golden Compass. The first week of December, Hari had gone without reading anything. Instead, he spent his time doodling in the corners of books, which earned him a mental tirade from Tom and a three-quarter lidded glare from Glim.

""I've got to go home for Christmas, y'know."" Hari stated needlessly. ""I probably won't be back until half-January.....I'm usually not.""

He fit his chin into the crook between the flat of his palm and the heel of his hand and effectively ignored the hoots from the tiny owl. He told himself he only imagined how concerned they sounded.

""It's almost her birthday, y'know? Eunice?"" Hari had seldom spoke of Mildred and Eunice--only of the good times they had spent together. The small window they all three had together made for very few stories, but for very good memories.

""She's turning five. She's so big now...And Mildred! She's two  already. She said her first word--no. It was funny."" A sad smile graced his face. Hari didn't stop the tears that leaked from his eyes and plopped onto the rough sketches of three smiley-faced children below. His smile began to wobble when he heard the clicking of talons, and dropped completely into choking sobs when he felt soft feathers press close against him.

Hari missed the rest of class that day, and true to his word he was pulled early for Christmas break and didn't return till late January.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

This year, Eunice's birthday would now be carefully monitored by Petunia. Just days after the beginning of Christmas break Vernon had made her feel ashamed of herself for her failure of keeping Eunice away from it. He had screamed at her so loudly that Hari could feel his cupboard walls vibrating about how Petunia had entrusted Mildred within its care. The morning after, Petunia had come out with bruises around her neck and spotting around her arms. Vernon carried deep scratches that were attempted to be covered with gauze and bandages in much the same areas.

Naturally, Petunia blamed Hari. She had forced him to play her bathtub game again, and would come in at random intervals to dunk his head down under the water and hold it there. Every time he drew blood when he clawed at her hand, he was wretched up and slammed back against the floor of the tub. It took an hour and a half before she allowed him up, and Hari whispered out thank you thank you thank you until he noticed that his clothes and his glasses were nowhere to be found.

""Wh-where--where are my clothes, m-ma'am?"" Hari rarely ever directly addressed any of the elder Dursleys, but he was cold and the heat wasn't on in this part of the house, and he didn't dare use his magic when Petunia was so near.

Petunia didn't answer him. Instead she wrapped her bony fingers around his wrist and tugged him through the house. Hari wrapped his free arm around his shoulder and tried to warm himself up. It was a futile attempt, since Petunia threw him out the back door into the snow and slammed the sliding door shut.

Immediately Hari's shivering increased tenfold. His hands were planted on the deck through the snow that cradled up half his body. He knew he wouldn't last long, so he would have to risk it.


"":Zestos:.""


Warmth crept up through Hari's form from the inside out. The heating charm provided sweet relief from the cold nearly blanketing him and from the snow that was beginning to fall outside. Snow turned to mush around his body due to his body heat, yet Hari shivered still. He was still cold and he didn't understand why.

'A heating charm would hardly be adequate dry, with clothing. You are wet and naked.' Tom's voice was dry, but Hari could tell that he was concerned. Hari knew he was right; even when Hari covered with his clothes and cast heating charms on them the chill in his cupboard never quite left.

In Hari's eyes, he was left with one option. He focused on the stars in his vision til they spiderwebbed and the third eye opened up. Once again, he sought out the world of multi-coloured silks and her voice.


""Please--please I need help again.""


Instantly he could feel the consciousness of the silks turn to him. They wrapped around him like a gentle, large hand holding him, before releasing him to swirl just in front of his face.


""Oh child, my child, what have they done to you?""


Three, serpentine heads appeared from the silks--one a smooth, soft yellow with a small neck, one a larger, persimmon-coloured with round features, and the last a mix of the red-blacks that made Hari think of Tom's very first form.

""My child, my child, do not fret. Your time is almost done here."" The soft orange snake spoke with the voice of Hari's dreams--of Lily.

""What pain awaits you, but do not fret, my child. We are here. I am here."" The darkest one, Ms. Figg, seemed sad as she looked at him.

The third snake head only stared at him, swaying her head from side to side and dipping it in the direction she was going. She wasn't as clear as the other two; slightly opaque and cloud looking. Her tongue stuck out at him, at the ends of her mouth curled in a definitely un-reptilian smile.

""Is--is she--are you okay?"" Hari pointed towards the yellow snake. He had a feeling that they all were part of the same Goddess, so it made sense that the other two snakes--or pieces--would know.

A hissing laugh was his answer that seemed to resonate from around the yellow snake. ""You haven't met me yet, my child."" Her voice was velvet and dreamlike.

Hadn't met her yet? He was pretty sure that this was the second meeting of the Goddess...but then again, both voices seemed to have been people he knew...


""Who are you?""



""I am us, and we are the Mother.""


Hari huffed a bit, much to the giggling hisses of the snakes. 'That didn't really answer anything,' Hari thought, before remembering that Tom was not a part of him here. Before he could ask another question he was engulfed in a warm, white silk. The metaphysical chill that continued to cling to his body began to dissipate, and Hari could comfortably breathe without feeling like he had just sucked in ice.

""Thank you."" Hari lowered his gaze to his feet and tried to bow, feeling a bit ridiculous attempting it starkers.


""No need to thank me, my child. For you will suffer a great pain at the hands of your peoples, and at the hands of mine. I shall help you, just as you shall help me, my child, my Champion, my Priest.""


The snakes merged together into one great beast. It would have resembled a lizard, with the serpentine body and the four legs that formed from silks, if not for how large and thick they were. It looked more like a dog than a lizard, if Hari looked past the whip-like tail, the flat, snake-shaped head, and the glimmering scales that shone in all shades the three had, shining like fire. It almost looked like a dragon from the books Hari had read, only lacking the great wings and spikes.


""Now go, child. For I fear that if you do not wake in your world, you may forever find yourself in mine.""


The beast laid what served as the bridge of its muzzle against Hari's chest and gently pushed his out of the entrance world.

When Hari awoke, he was in a hospital, surrounded by people in white coats talking too fast for him to understand. He glanced to his sides and saw that his arms were hooked up to several machines, and that he was apparently tucked tightly into the hospital bed. He heard shrieking about how he's awake! but didn't take too much into it. Instead, he looked at the small face pressed against the glass door, leaving tear streaks and puffs of breath against it. Brown curls were the last thing he saw before he fell back into unconsciousness, but this time, thankfully, in his own world.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The first thing Hari thought of when he awake back in the hospital room was a word that Ms. Figg would not of approved of him knowing. The second thought that came to Hari's mind was how much trouble he was going to be in for drawing attention to himself, let alone medical attention. Hari didn't even want to think about what would happen when the Dursleys got the bill.

He groaned and felt a cool hand press against his forehead.

""--ri?"" He could barely make out the voice that trembled with the cool drops landing on his face. He felt a thumb wipe the wetness away, a dull, short nail catching on his cheek. It wasn't Petunia then; not that Hari thought it had been in the first place.

""Hari?"" The voice, definitely female, tried again. ""Hari, are you awake? How are you feeling, dear?""

Dear. Only one person called him that.

""M' Fi'?"" He tried to call out her name, but the words could barely form past his lips. He seemed correct in his assessment, at least, because more of what he assumed were tears dripped onto his face before being wiped away by a careful hand. The same hand that was running through his hair. Only Ms. Figg knew that Hari liked that.

""Yes, dear, it's Ms. Figg, I'm here,"" She hurried to assure him, alternating between whispering that he was going to be fine and that how dare the Dursleys leave him outside, despite what they told. At Hari's inquisition, Ms. Figg told him that apparently Petunia had left him out there for well over an hour. Eunice had been the one to call Ms. Figg from the Little Whinging's Phone Book, and Ms. Figg had called the paramedics. Petunia had caught Eunice on the phone and dragged Hari inside, wrapping him hurriedly in half-wet towels that had been soaked in hot water and throwing him in a spare bedroom. Her explanation to the paramedics included Hari throwing a tantrum, and a brief, ""accidental"" summary of his defiant behavior in both school and at Number Four.

Since the doctors had no reason to suspect child abuse, and had teachers to corroborate the Dursleys story, Hari was still entrusted in their care. The only way Ms. Figg had been allowed to visit was by threatening to tell the authorities the truth. When Hari asked why she hadn't in the first place, she merely told him that Dumbledore would overrule her and place him back. If anything, he would be in even more trouble for leaving. That bit had caused her great sniffles that didn't subside for several minutes, and Hari was unable to get anything else out of her for the rest of her visit.

She was his only visitor during his stay, which lasted from December 11th to the 16th. After he was discharged into the safe hands of the Dursleys, he was put immediately to work on Eunice's birthday. This year she wanted a horse theme. It made Hari feel happy knowing that he may have influenced why.

Replacing the pink ribbons of last year would now be braided ropes tied carefully into knots. Instead of sparkling, pink garlands there would now be horseshoes chained together and hung from the light fixtures. The goody bags were decorated as black ""villain"" and white ""sheriff"" cowboy hats, with oatmeal and chocolate chip treats inside. In place of pink velvet cake would now be something called derby cake--chocolate and whip cream and fruit all baked into one cake--in the shape of a large rectangle Hari was ordered to decorate like the races.

It wasn't as bad as last year, for now it meant something instead of Eunice trying to look like the animated lady on the telly. Hari still seethed when he thought about how Petunia had told Eunice that she wished Eunice looked more like the Barbie girl. But now there was no more needless making up. There was only happiness, and if a bit of sadness as well, for the memories that the horse theme brought to both Hari and Eunice's mind.

He was even ordered to set up the back yard for horse games, which would consist of the children riding stick horses over ""obstacle courses"" Hari swore Petunia designed just to make it harder. Stepping outside in the snow, even though he was clothed, set him back to nearly freezing to death. It took everything Hari had not to panic, forcing himself to walk out, start a fire in the firepit, and begin shoveling snow away. Every brush of harsh wind had him anxiously switching his gaze over to the sliding back door, forcing his magic to push it open just to make sure it wasn't locked.

He knew that this was light punishment, and was terrified of what could possibly be next. He wouldn't find out for a while.

While Eunice's birthday went off without a hitch, Hari was too busy worrying about what the Dursleys could have planned. Was he going to be frozen again? Put in the bath? Starved? Beaten? Possibilities swirled throughout his mind for days. On December 29th, Hari got his answer.

He had been locked in his cupboard straight from the moment he had finished preparing for Eunice's party. He wasn't to be let out, and once again relied on Tom to keep him healthy, less hungry, and somewhat clean. Then Petunia had unlocked his cupboard terrifyingly slow, the door creaking open to reveal her completely devoid of emotion. She wasn't angry, or snide, or even smiling that smile. Somehow, it scared Hari all the more.

She had crooked her finger at him, indicating Hari to follow her. Willessly, Hari obeyed. The walked to the kitchen, shocking a rather filthy Dudley, where Petunia had ordered Hari's shirt off. This confused Hari, since she usually hated seeing any part of him, let alone more of him. The puzzle pieces began to fit together when she turned on the top of the gas stove. Clutching his shirt to his chest, Hari began to back away. Petunia seemed unperturbed.

""You know,"" she began. ""I read the other day that a mother had put her child up on the stove for misbehaving. The papers called her all sorts of nasty names, but she was a brilliant woman. She got the brat to behave. I just don't see why you can't behave and be a good boy, darling.""

She turned, a sickening parody of a grin beginning to split her mouth. Dudley called out a soft, scared ""mum?"" only to be ignored. Small, blue-orange flames rose behind her and Hari knew he was in hell.

When his back hit the cool expanse of the fridge, Hari turned to bolt away. If he could run fast enough then maybe, just maybe, he could make it to Ms. Figg's without Petunia catching him. His hopes of escape shattered when he was caught by the arm before he could lift a foot in the other direction.

Petunia twisted his arm back behind his body and yanked him over to the stove. Hari could feel the flames beginning to lick at the baby-fine hairs along his arm and desperately jerked his body away. It only earned him a backhanded slap to the face and a rather vicious slamming of his arm onto the lit gas-plate of the stove.

Hari screamed. He screamed as he felt the flesh of his arms being pulled to tightly and burned away, crackling like shattered glass. When Petunia urged him further over the stove, Hari lashed out. His magic slammed against her, sending Petunia thrashing against the flames and Hari backwards against the tile.

If Hari had screamed, Petunia wailed. She flung herself back as soon as she could, but the damage was done. Her once shoulder-length, brown hair she had been so proud of was now sizzling at varying lengths and thicknesses around her ears. Her face that had been dyed from years of overused makeup was a shining red colour that looked raw, mimicked in patterns across her neck and arms.

Tears streamed down the two children's faces, both for different reasons. As Hari tried to muffle his cries, Dudley openly sobbed and sought along the kitchen counter for the home phone. The two youngest Dursley children came running into the kitchen, shrieking at the bodies on the floor. While Mildred sat and began bawling, Eunice ran over to Hari and fisted her tiny hands in the material of his pants, begging him to be okay. Blue light ran over Hari's burns, soft and new, and began to shakily repair the damage that had been done.

Hari merely let a few more tears leak out. This was his punishment for being in the hospital, what was going to happen now that he had sent Petunia to the hospital?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Turns out, nothing would be done to Hari now that Petunia was in the hospital. Doctors had obviously become suspicious when Hari came back with second degree burns along his right arm, especially when Petunia had come along with varying degree burns in a number of places. So, Hari was to be removed to a foster home for a few months until Child Services could verify that the Dursley's were either abusive or Hari was simply a delinquent.

Once again, Ms. Figg had been the very first visitor in Hari's room, apart now from Eunice and Mildred when they could sneak in and from Hari's caseworker. She had offered to become Hari's foster mother, and a tearful Hari told her that he would love to have Ms. Figg as a mother. Ms. Figg hadn't corrected him.

That was how a rather determined Ms. Figg waltzed up to Hari's caseworker and demanded that she be given the information on how to become a foster mother; specifically Hari's foster mother. Hari's caseworker, a rather tall lady with long, black hair named Jamie Kent, had practically interrogated Ms. Figg about her motives. When Hari had assured Mrs. Kent about Ms. Figg with a tiny bit of persuasion magic, Mrs. Kent said that she would see if she could pull a few strings since Miss Arabella was such a competent caretaker.

Less than two weeks later, one Arabella Urial Figgueroa was given custody was one Hari James Potter.

Hari had been simultaneously filled with excitement and anxiety at the prospect of moving in with Ms. Figg. His room had been left mostly the same, with the cot being taken out and replaced with a small, horizontal bookshelf. He had been pleasantly surprised to find that most of the books on the shelf were magical, a mix of educational and children's picture books. His desk had been replaced with a larger one, complete with a mini shelving and drawer unit that Hari felt slightly guilty about having. Really, Hari felt guilty about having everything in the room--it had to of cost Ms. Figg a lot of money, and Hari didn't have near enough to pay her back. So, Hari asked her what was expected of him to pay off his debt.

""Whatever do you mean, dear?"" Ms. Figg seemed rather confused, more so than Hari felt.

""My debt, Ms. Figg, for making you spend money on me.""

Ms. Figg seemed to gain a sudden click of clarity. ""Well, I suppose if you wanted to, you could let me be your teacher?""

""My teacher?"" Hari blinked owlishly.

Ms. Figg only smiled. ""Yes, your teacher. You see, I haven't had a child to care for--long term,"" she gave a rather pointed look at Hari. ""In quite a while. Cristiano was our--my--only son, and he was.....before.....He never got to have children."" 

Ms. Figg sniffled. Hari patted her hand. He knew it was hard for her to talk about her son and what happened.

""Of course! I would love to learn from you, Ms. Figg."" Hari rushed out, linking their fingers together.

""You may call me Arabella, or whatever you please, Hari."" She smiled at him. ""Now, I happen to know that your closet is dreadfully empty, so what do you say about going on a little trip?""

Despite Hari's quiet protests, Ms. Figg had led him to her purple Audi Quattro and even let him sit in the front. She drove him to South Wright Square and they spent the rest of the day visiting various outlet malls located there. By the time they returned, Ms. Figg's trunk, backseat, and even the foot space under Hari was full of bulging bags of clothes, shoes, and school supplies. She had helped him hang them up and sort through his shoes, and presented him with a brand new backpack that she encouraged him to take to school on Monday.

For the first time in a long while, Hari went to school excited. He began excelling in his classes, despite his still-healing injury, and met up with Glim in the library for reading sessions during their usual times. Even Dudley and his gang were leaving him alone, and Hari felt fantastic. He was gaining weight by being allowed to eat as much as he wanted during meal times, and no longer felt constantly light headed or sick to his stomach.

He finished school with high Cs, and even a few low Bs, Something he had shamefully presented to Ms. Figg. She had merely smiled her smile at him and told him that he must be extremely smart to have pulled up his grades so high in such a small amount of time. She had a way of making Hari feel proud of himself and forget that he ""shouldn't be"". On the first Sunday of summer break Ms. Figg burst into his room at an hour she usually claimed was simply ungodly, announcing that they were to go to on a very special visit that day.

She helped Hari pick out an appropriate outfit and brushed his tangled hair into a somewhat manageable mane that brushed his shoulders. She had also baked, for some unknown reason. When Hari inquired about the small cookies and treats, she simply smiled--not her smile--at them.

""We're going to the Wizarding world today, to visit my son.""

Cristiano. From what Hari had been told and had gathered himself, Cristiano was a permanent resident of St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, and had no hope of recovering.

""I also thought we may stop by at Diagon Alley, to get you a few trinkets.""

Diagon Alley. He had heard of it from Tom, and the off-handed mentionings from Ms. Figg. It was supposed to be one of the branches of the main English Wizarding community, serving mostly as a school supply shopping outlet with the odd toystore here and there. It was served as only one of many alleys that tied to Akadem Alley, or Akadem Central, which Ms. Figg said held the British Wizarding Ministry. Had thought that must have made it rather important, but Tom laughed in his head and made snide comments about how something called Gringotts and Ollivanders were more important on their own than the entirety of the Ministry put together.

All the talk of magical Alleys and this magic shop or that one had Hari very excited at the prospect of how exactly they would get there. All sorts of ideas ran through his mind--from flying like Mary Poppins to riding a dragon! He was very confused when instead, Ms. Figg simply pulled out her very purple car and encouraged him to get in.

Thus, now that Hari's daydreams of riding a dragon had been inadvertently crushed, Hari began new daydreams. Ones that involved flying cars to teleporting cars to even cars that went faster than Hari could see! He wondered what they would arrive at--maybe a castle! Like Hogwarts, or maybe a dragon's keep! Or maybe they would find a secret, underground club of witches and wizards--

They were at a gardening store. A simple, redbrick department store that looked as if it had seen better days. The faded, peeling label on top labeled it Sun Stop, and under the lime green awning was a bubbly young woman greeting people and switching which doors she was opening for them.

Ms. Figg grasped his hand and led him over to the practically bouncing brunette.

""Ms. Figg, welcome back! How can we help you today?""

She wore a shiny badge that switched between a plough crossing a strange looking plant and a long, thin stick crossing a bone when the sun caught off of it. Ms. Figg smiled at her and pulled her into a hug, which the girl accepted.

""Thank you, Ms. Tuckett; what am I ever here for? Though I suppose a garden would be nice..."" Ms. Figg trailed off in thought, releasing Ms. Tuckett. Ms. Tuckett giggled and pulled a silver pin from her pocket, fastening it on Ms. Figg's collar.

""Of course, Cristiano will be delighted to see you. I heard he was transferred to the South Wing, so he must be doing better!"" The tiny woman gave an encouraging grin to the duo and turned her attentions on Hari, ""And who's this little cutiepie?""

Before Ms. Figg could answer, Hari gave a shy smile and piped up. ""My name is Hari Potter, ma'am.""

He watched Ms. Tuckett's smile curve down and fall, her entire face curling in on itself in barely-hidden disgust. ""Oh...Potter... "" She knew which Potter. Everyone knew which Potter Hari was. The son of the high-ranking Death Eater, James Potter, who betrayed the Light and got over two-hundred people killed, including his own wife and the wife of one of his best friends.

She deposited another silver pin into Ms. Figg's hand and dutifully ignored the small boy, even under the disapproving glare of Ms. Figg. The younger woman simply sniffed disdainfully when the elder woman clipped the pin to Hari's soft blue button up. Ms. Figg slid her hand into Hari's and tugged him along through the left door, which was not being held open for them, he noticed. Though Hari didn't pay too much attention to Ms. Tuckett once they were inside, because even though the outside was a crumbling, peeling chain-link store, the inside was truly magical.

Luminescent, pale lavender tiles covered the floors with deep violet-red wallpaper across the walls that could be seen. There were cherry-wood arches and furniture, covered with, and accentuated by, long drapes of a strange looking sage that Hari had never seen before. Pots of lavender hung from the ceilings, sat on the floor, and stayed suspended against the walls, the scent thick in the air. In place of electric lights were large windows that had different sceneries playing out in each one--a Saharan desert, a Brazilian rainforest, an Arctic penguin group, and an underwater waterfall. Next to each window was a strange, green-copper looking dial, each arrow pointing at what Hari thought could be a different station, like a Muggle radio.

And the people. Witches and Wizards ran around in robes of varying shades of vibrant greens with lavender or grey-white undertones. Shouts of Healer so-and-so! and Mediwizard! or Mediwitch! so-and-so, and Hari marveled at the hustle of the hospital.

Ms. Figg tugged him into a large elevator, something Hari wouldn't have expected in a magical building, and pressed the number 5. Before the door shut, two more people got on in lime green robes. Ms. Figg told him that they were full-fledged Healers. She wrapped her arm around him and used the other to hold a hardy grip on the handle on the wall, and Hari only understood why when they lurched off at a speed that made Hari's stomach drop.









The male Healer got off at the third floor, the elevator shooting forward to the North Wing, and then backwards and to the left before returning on it's dizzying speed upwards. Ms. Figg and Hari were deposited in the West Wing Entrance and barely had enough time to step out of what Hari classified as a death trap before it shot off again, the lady inside looking completely unperturbed.









The fifth floor was quite different than the first; instead of tile that reminded Hari of light purple starbursts, there was deep red hardwood. Replacing the near maroon colour of the walls was a very muted tea-brown that made Hari feel very calm, especially with the same lavender plants potted along the floor. Along with them sat several other plants that Hari had no names for, but came in a variety of dazzling shades that made Hari's eyes sparkle.









""This way, deary,"" Ms. Figg tittered,tugging him back along a hallway behind the elevator. Her heels clicked along the wood in tandem with the Mediwitches' and wizards' on the floor, something that grated on Hari's sensitive ears. They eventually came to a sort of lobby, complete with plush couches on top of a very soft-looking rug, and dozens of fireplaces lining the walls. Hari thought that maybe they had a bit too many fire pits, until he witnessed Magia popping out of them, followed by puffs of green fire.









'They're flooing. The Floo is a wizarding transportation system setup in fireplaces. Quite messy if you ask me.' Tom sniffed out a 'hmph' at the sight of people banishing soot and ash from their clothing. Hari thought of the day he found Ms. Figg in such a state, and wondered if that was what she had been doing herself.









""Ms. Figg?"" He tugged gently on her hand when they rounded the corner to Hallway 8-F. She let out a small hum and Hari decided it was safe to continue with his questions; after all, Ms. Figg hadn't ever punished him before. ""Why didn't we come out of the fireplace?"" He didn't think he should mention the world floo, since his foster mother would then wonder where he got it from, and Hari didn't particularly feel like lying to her.









""The firepla--oh! You mean the floo, darling."" Hari struggled not to flinch at the endearment, worrying the skin of his cheek between his teeth. ""You can only floo one at a time, and--well with your family's reputation and your own inexperience, I didn't want to risk you getting lost."" She pretended not to see Hari's face fall, but she did slip her hand out from his and wrap her arm around his small shoulders instead.









It didn't take long after for them to reach a plain, red wooden door marked Figgueroa. Ms. Figg drew in a deep breath and turned a watery smile to Hari.









""Now, I--I know it'll--it'll be shocking for you to see--well for you to see him. He can't help it.""









Hari squared his shoulders, but it wasn't enough for what met him inside. He had expected Cristiano to of looked normal, just been mentally unable to take care of himself, or perhaps be in a coma. This was not so. Pacing across the room was a strange, monstrous creature that looked half burned and half rotten. Permanently purpling lay on unnaturally green-brown skin that was stretched too tight over a skeletal figure, rising and falling with crude surgical-looking scars all over what body it had.










This was Cristiano.










It--he--turned to them, and Hari backed away behind Ms. Figg's skirt. Cristiano only had one arm, his left, with barely any fingers left. Those that resided were in bits and pieces. His right side didn't even have a shoulder--a large dip curving his body where the appendage and much more was obviously missing. His lips and nose were gone, and his eyes were a milky white that Hari would have attributed to blindness if not for the way that Cristiano seemed acutely aware of where everyone and everything stood in the room.

""Meu filho, look at you! Walking all by yourself!"" Ms. Figg seemed proud and sad at the same time, and urged Hari to sit in one of the visitor's chairs with her. Cristiano sat too, on his bed, curled up in the corner with his knees drawn to his chest. Hari found this to be very familiar to him, and realized why; Hari adopted this look when he was afraid. Then another light bulb went off--Cristiano was afraid. Cristiano was afraid of Hari. 

""Meu filho, I brought you a friend. This is Hari, and he's very excited to meet you.""

Cristiano let out what should have been a low keening noise, but came out raspy and broken. Hari reached out with his magic, and was surprised when he was hit full front with an onslaught of 'Medo--medo--medomedomedo.' 

Hari thought Tom was the only one who could talk inside Hari's head.

'Legilimency makes it easier to gain access to someone's thoughts. Especially someone who is apparently a Legilimens as well. It becomes a sort of telepathy.' Tom actually seemed impressed that Cristiano could react with Hari's magic in such a way. 'You could see if he's coherent, if you wanted.' Tom tried to shrug it off, but Hari knew that it was a suggestion that would most likely benefit the three physical beings in the room.

Hari reached out again to Cristiano. His magic had a shattered feeling. Like a puzzle that had been scattered with too many pieces lost.


'Cristiano, can you hear me?'


Hari felt shock through the temporary bond, laced with the tiniest tinge of hope.


'Who who who who who?'


The same echoes rang throughout his mind, repeating upon themselves and grating through Hari's ears. Ms. Figg didn't seem to notice a change in her son's demeanour, simply pulled out the cookies from her bag and began pulling the plastic wrap off of them.


'I'm Hari.'


All the shards of Cristiano's magic aimed themselves at Hari, and even Ms. Figg noticed when Cristiano began attempted to scream. His hand tried to claw along the bumps of his head as cracked, hoarse noises came from his mouth. His mind filled with tangles of Potter and getoutgetoutgetout, thoughts knotting themselves together with the pain that racked his body. Hari knew it probably was a bad idea to reach out and touch Cristiano, so he did the next best thing. Hari sent out healing magic, magic full of memories, and magic meant to calm Cristiano.

The effect was almost instant. His hand came down from trying to scratch at his head, the pained near-silent screams subsided, and Cristiano stopped rocking. He started humming. It was difficult for him, without proper lips, but sure enough small buzzes that resembled music came from where they would have been.


'I'm here with your Mum. She...she misses you.'


Ms. Figg was crying, petting the blankets near her son, to hesitant to reach out to him in case he lashed out.


'Mamae?'


Cristiano had the ability to recognize that people were in his room, but had no ability to associate who they were based on his memories of before his injury. So, while he could somewhat remember his mother, he hadn't known it was her that was visiting him; only that the same woman visited him mostly the same days at the same time. At the mention of his mother, his white eyes began to water, and Ms. Figg began sobbing hopelessly. She couldn't understand what was wrong.


'Eu amo mamae.'


Hari had a feeling that that probably meant something along the lines of I love you, and desperately wanted to tell Ms. Figg. But telling her would mean revealing that he had been communicating with Cristiano...and telling her how he had known to do so...

But she sounded so sad.

""Ms--Ms. Figg?""

If she heard him, she made no indications. Tears rolled down her face as she clutched the covers around her son, whispering in the language Cristiano spoke and Hari didn't understand.

""Ms. Figg? Cristiano--um--he says that--he says he loves you.""

Ms. Figg's gaze snapped up to him. ""Don't you dare, Hari. Don't you dare say something like that--especially like that--to me.""

""N-no really, Ms. Figg--""

""How dare you--""

""He called you mamae? Eu amo mamae?""

Ms. Figg stopped. Large, pregnant tears rolled slowly down her face. Hari didn't know Portuguese. There was no possible way for him to know Portuguese, despite the mangled mispronunciation....So that meant--that meant.....

She let out a great sob and risked grasping her son's hand. Cristiano flinched heavily, but allowed himself to be pulled up into his mother's arms. The same phrase kept repeating in his head, even as unintelligible gurgles spilled from his mouth. His own hand searched wildly until it found Hari's smaller one, and Cristiano held tightly. No words needed to be exchanged between the trio--Hari knew what it meant.

Hari and Ms. Figg didn't quite make it to Diagon Alley that day. However, Hari had found something better than a magical toy or trinket;

Hari had found a brother.

A Will and a Way


(or rather, To the Cupboard Under the Stairs)


Hari's eleventh summer had been bittersweet. After his revelation with Cristiano's only means of communication, Ms. Figg had gone straight to the lead Healer and requested a MindMender. She claimed that her nephew Hari was an accidental Legilimens, and that he had stumbled into Cristiano's mind. It wasn't exactly a common practice, but it wasn't impossible either. The only problem was that Legilimens MindMenders were hard to come by in English wizarding community after their war, and none were too keen on portkeying out to the United Kingdom.

Cristiano's healing was put on hold until they could find someone qualified for his particular situation with enough time to dedicate to the patient. It would be a long wait, but Hari and Ms. Figg had hope.

Even with Cristiano's new means of communication, he was still wary of talking too long with Hari. He swapped between short, choppy sentences that gave Hari the impression he was hyper-paranoid, and forgetting who Hari was (aside from the fact he was most definitely a Potter), and screaming for the near entirety of Hari and Ms. Figg's visits.













The latter times were becoming less and less as Ms. Figg took Hari along to visit Cristiano more frequently, for as long as the Mediwitches would allow them to stay. Hari made an attempt to seep some of his magic into Cristiano's mind, beginning to fill in the cracks of what use to hold it together. He hadn't felt that he made much progress in the few weeks he had been able to access Cristiano's mind, it was becoming more obvious in the way he began conversing, and reached out to take hold of his mother's hand each time she entered.













Hari held out hopes that soon he could make Cristiano's constant shiverings cease, and perhaps then he could write.







Currently he was laying in his bed, waiting for Ms. Figg to reappear from the fireplace, conversing exactly how to go about mending a mind with Tom.







'There shouldn't be any pieces ""missing"", as you say, merely buried in the subconscious. You won't be able to dig them out with your level of Legilimency yet, at least not without driving yourself completely insane, or forcing Mr. Figgueroa into an emptier shell than what he was.' 







Well, that was.....most of his options off the table, really. Hari didn't necessarily like forcing his way into other's heads, especially when it was easy, but he knew the boon outweighed the moral consequences.













However, if he couldn't simply force the pieces back into place, how was he supposed to heal Cristiano?













A mental tongue flicked against the inside of his brow. 'If you continue as you are, little by little, some will eventually return on their own. Some are better remaining gone.'







Hari huffed and buried his face into the soft mismatched pillows that littered his bed. Ms. Figg had early on discovered Hari's affection for fluffy pillows and soft blankets, and had begun swarming him with them, much to his own embarrassment.













'Either way, you shouldn't be focusing on such matters. Today is a special day, is it not?' Tom's voice turned proud, soft scales expanding out to 'hug' Hari.













He was right--today Hari was eleven, and more excited than he had ever been. Tom had been telling him tales of Hogwarts, and how Hari was sure to receive his letter at midnight.  Surprisingly, Tom had even regaled Hari with stories of his own Hogwarts letter and his time there (mostly about idiotic students and incompetent teachers, and how he didn't expect Dumbledore to be any better judge of character than Tom's own Headmaster, Armando Dippet).













'Dumbledore was the reason I was allowed to come to power, you know.' 













It still disturbed Hari to think of his Tom being one with the Dark Lord Voldemort, and had said so on an occasion. All that had earned him was a lecture on how disassociating the two would cause Hari more harm than anything. That it was important Hari remember that Tom was Voldemort, but no longer is, instead of imagining the two as different entities.













'Um, how?' 













'I released a juvenile Basilisk into the plumbing system.' He said matter-of-factly, as if that was supposed to make any sense to Hari.














    'A....a what?'














'A Basilisk. They're magical creatures that resemble snakes. They're able to understand parseltongue, so it was fairly easy to control it.' 













    And again, Hari had more questions than answers. He wasn't incompetent, he figured if a Basilisk was a great snake and Tom could speak to it like Hari spoke to him and to the garden snakes, then Parseltongue must be the language they spoke.













'Dumbledore had been suspicious of me from the minute we met, and I'm fairly sure he knew I was breeding Basilisks. He never went to the headmaster, however, and a classmate of mine died as a result. I believe she's still there.' His tongue flicked out absently, as if the thought had just occurred to him. At least he sounded ashamed.














    'And he never....did anything?'














'I suppose he tried, but in the end I managed to pin the blame on another classmate of mine. It was fairly easy, since he was half-giant with a history of smuggling in dangerous creatures. It....I hadn't released her on purpose, and I wish it hadn't ended up being Rubeus who took the blame.' 













'A half-giant?' In passing, Tom had mentioned magical beings Hari could only recognize form the footnotes in Ms. Figg's textbooks. Despite them being more-or-less human, Hari had been under the impression that they couldn't.....well.....have children with others outside their race.













    'Rubeus Hagrid. We were something akin to.....friends in my time. Views upon magical non-humans and half-humans were barbaric at best.' 













'Barbaric?' 













    Hari could feel the swell of magic against the forefront of his mind, the telltale sign that Tom was about to show him something, before they were interrupted by the choking poofs of the floo. Normally, it wouldn't of worried Hari since he was expecting Ms. Figg to arrive much the same way she had left. It wouldn't of worried Hari if he hadn't of heard more than a handful of sputters from the fireplace, and more than one set of feet against Ms. Figg's tile.














    ""Ouh! I can't wait to meet the little bugger!""














""Nymphadora!"" 













""Don't call me--"" 







    He recognized Ms. Figg's voice, but the other, higher-pitch mingled with at least three other sets of voices, trying not to shout over the continued floo noises. Panic settled in, his muscles clenching and his hand grasping at the blankets underneath him. There wasn't a window in the room, but Hari knew that if he wanted to he could force his way out.






















    ""Now, now! You'll scare the poor dear!"" 






















That voice reminded him of Ms. Figg, but it sounded heavier and deeper, like the librarian from his school.






















    ""You all finish setting up and I'll go get him.""






















    It was of little comfort to hear Ms. Figg again when there were so many strangers in the house. Would she keep him safe?





















    Of course she would.  





















He felt a bit ashamed of himself thinking otherwise, but didn't have long before her footsteps were outside his door and his door was knocked on and creaking open. All the tension melted from his body the minute he spotted her, leaving confusion in his wake. Usually Ms. Figg wore loose shirts and long-flowing skirts and the godforsaken sandals Hari couldn't bring himself to tell Ms. Figg he hated when she asked him about them. Instead, she was wearing a beautiful honey-gold pantsuit and brown flats that had tiny heels. She had done up her makeup like she did when she took Hari out, and had curled her hair and allowed it to fall freely around her shoulders.





















""Happy birthday, dearie. I've got a bit of a surprise for you outside, but I'm afraid you're going to have to get dressed first."" Her tone was teasing and she smiled at the way Hari suddenly seemed very shy in his pajamas.





















""I--I don't know what to wear.""





















""Don't fret, I'll help you pick something out."" She sounded entirely too excited about something for Hari's comfort as she walked over to his dresser drawers and began rifling through the button-ups she had insisted on buying him. She settled on a soft teal shirt with black slacks and waived off his question about shoes. ""You won't have to worry about that until tomorrow, darling. Mediwitch Orping said we may be able to bring Cristiano home for a teeny bit, as long as she can come.""













Hari plucked right up, just as she suspected, and she gave him one last gentle smile before allowing him his privacy.













'This is the best birthday ever.' Hari thought to himself. He wasn't expecting a reply, but the soft I agree from Tom made it all the more special.













When he finished dressing he slowly creaked his door open, still apprehensive of the voices coming from the kitchen. He rounded the corner and almost blanched at how many people were there.













""Wotcher Hari!""













Ah, so that was Nymphadora. He thought the odd name quite fit with her electric bubblegum hair that seemed to tangle even worse than his own. Wisely, he kept any comment about it to himself.













""Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.""













And that was the not-Ms. Figg.













""I'm Amelia Bones, and I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.""













She outstretched her hand and Hari was unsure if he was allowed to touch her, or if there was a special protocol he was supposed to follow. Did he have to kiss her hand? He did so just in case, making sure not to grasp to hard to let his own hand or mouth linger where they could be severely unwanted. He thought he had made a mistake when her face dusted pink and she began choking.













""Well! Isn't he a little gentleman! Much more so than our son, I'll say, eh Milly, dear?""













Another woman wrapped her arms around Mrs. Bones' waist, who turned to her and began trying to smother her own laughter in the new woman's shoulder.













""You'll have to forgive my wife, I fear you may have just swept her off her feet! You'll have to forgive me as well, for I may be a teensy-bit jealous."" The new woman (the other Mrs. Bones?) seemed to be attempting very hard not to burst into giggles. She was a sight next to her wife--wild, long blonde hair and sparkling green eyes with delicate pale skin contrasted with Ms. Amelia's dark brown hair that was pulled tightly up on her head and tanned skin that shown small scars where Hari could see. Her voice was also softer, and reminded Hari more of Lily while Ms. Amelia mirrored Ms. Figg. He decided he quite like the Mrs. Bones'.













""Oh dear, I haven't even introduced myself! I'm Belladonna, call me Donna please,  and this is our son Olivar, and our niece Susan.""













She pushed forward two children that seemed to be around Hari's age, a girl with fiery-red hair that reminded Hari of a fox, and a boy that seemed to be a carbon copy of Ms. Donna if she had whacked all her hair off. Hari gently took their hands one at a time, and simply shook them now that he knew it was fine. The redhead--Susan, Hari assumed--pulled an offended face when he had shaken his, however.













""I suppose my aunt is the only lady present?""













When Hari's face turned stricken she immediately lit up like the Yule lights Hari had always loved and began giggling madly, rivaling her aunt.













""You hardly qualify as a lady. The crushed bit of that beetle I found on my shoe, maybe.""













""Oh shut up Olivar!""













""Children, stop fighting this instant."" Ms. Amelia seemed to of recovered, but despite her no-nonsense tone that had the two bucking up, her face threatened to break out into another grin.













""Well, if you'll excuse my behavior, I'm Amelia Bones, as you know, and you may call me Amelia. This is my apprentice, Nymph--""













""Don't call me Nymphadora!"" To Hari's surprise, the bubblegum pink hair the woman had previously been sporting seemed to boil into a deep red that seemed to steam. She leveled a rather impressive glare to a rather unimpressed Ms. Amelia, before her hair bubbled back to electric pink and she seized Hari's hand herself. With the way she started accosting his hand, Hari thought he may be lucky to have one left after she was finished.













""I'm Tonks."" She put special emphasis on the name and for a moment Hari was terrified if she had been able to read his mind earlier. ""Number-one auror trainee, top of my field, gold star, absolutely at your service at any time!"" She began prattling off ranks and terms and stories that Hari didn't even half-understand before she was gently nudged aside by a somewhat exasperated-looking Ms. Figg.













""Well, now that you've met everyone, perhaps we should have lunch? I had hoped to go out, but I'm afraid I don't know what you like best."" She seemed a bit upset at the prospect, and Hari hurried to reassure her.













""Don't worry, Ms. Figg, I don't think any place in the whole wide world could beat your cooking.""













At the sight of her teary eyes, he was terrified he had said something wrong until a large smile broke out of her face and Ms. Donna's laughter rang throughout the house.













""Yes, well, Let's eat then, hmm?""













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













It could certainly be said that while Hari was a bit biased towards Ms. Figg's cooking, he most definitely wasn't wrong. She had prepared a large meal fit for an entire army of guests, having a large magical creature Hari felt a bit guilty that he didn't know the name of for the main course, with sides of both muggle and magical origins.









He had also learned that Susan was currently twelve versus Olivar's ten, and that they were both ecstatic to have someone right in the middle. While they were cousins, Hari believed they couldn't of been closer if they had been born siblings. They bickered over absolutely everything, and much to Hari's amusement (and everyone else's chargin), had roped Tonks into over half off their arguments, with at least one starting a sneak food-fight. That one had ended rather abruptly at Ms. Figg's threats of withholding cake, along with one Susan covered in some sort of rice and bean paste, one Olivar doused in sparkling grape cider, and one Hari covered face-first into what had looked and felt like a pie, and Tonks with what could have been a broken nose.















Ms. Figg had then brought out the cake after Ms. Donna had hastily spelled away the mess while Ms. Amelia spelled Tonks' nose clean and healed, all because A--Ms. Figg was nearly in hysterics over her kitchen floor, and B--Tonks had begun to raise her wand to try to clean. It was a tall, white cake decorated with coconut shavings and dried fruits, with a duo of sizzling 1's atop it that changed colour every time they sparked.













It was one of the best things Hari had ever seen (maybe only slightly beat by waking up to Ms. Figg making him breakfast).













They all sang Happy Birthday to him, albeit the newly dubbed trio of terror all chimed in with disasterfully different versions that each had Hari cackling.













And while Hari was more than grateful for the food, and the cake, and especially the company, he couldn't imagine that they had gotten him presents.













Ms.' Donna and Amelia had gotten him the books he would need at Hogwarts, and Ms. Amelia had waived it off when Hari protested and tried to give them back because it's too much! You shouldn't spend so much on me! 













""We got a discount either way! A bundle so we could get Olivar's as well, even if it is a tad early.""













Susan and Olivar had turned in fistfulls of their pocket money to buy him a small basket full of sweets from a shop called Honeydukes, and Susan shrugged at the But you shouldn't of--that was aimed at her.













""Hey, as long as you admit Hufflepuff is the superior house, we're cool.""













Hari nodded despite Olivar's protests that Gryffindor was the best, and Tom's mental Gryffidiot.













Tonks had gotten him a small pouch that he didn't see the point of but was thankful for anyway, until she stuck her entire arm into the pouch and pulled out several objects that Hari was positive were much too large to fit into it. The things she pulled out were met with a highly disapproving Ms. Figg, who was assured that Hari wasn't interested in that pranking nonsense, thankyouverymuch! Which tonks had retaliated with a smart But he has a legacy to live up to! 













The room went tense and silent for a moment, with Tonks' hair turning a more pastel pink that matched the flushing of her face when she realized what she had said. Susan was the one to break the silence, thankfully.













""Well, I dunno. The marauders mostly got caught didn't they? I know it's a quick assumption, but I don't think Hari's that much of a Gryffindork--I mean idiot. Well, same thing really.""













That had started a ""House Pride"" war that seemed to even stretch to Ms. Figg, who was adamant that Ravenclaw had the highest hand, and the Mrs.' Bones teasing each other over Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff.













It had finally settled down when Hari had thanked everyone a bit loudly, which put Ms. Figg in a burst of embarrassment.













""Oh dear! I almost forgot my gift to you, darling!""













Once again, Hari's stuttered protests were ignored as Ms. Figg rushed through the living room into her bedroom. He didn't think he could imagine a better gift than this--than anything he'd been given by his new friends and everything Ms. Figg had ever done for him.













Ms. Figg's gift was an emotional one.













She returned holding a plain, manilla envelope with a few coloured paper clips peeking out of the side. She sat down on her weathered couch beside Hari and gently placed the folder onto his lap. He gently lifted the edge of the folder to reveal a bunch of papers covered in legalese he couldn't begin to hope to understand.













""Ms. Figg--um, I don't--""













""They're adoption papers, Hari.""













Everyone held their breath. You could of heard a pin drop to the floor. Hari stared at the papers, uncomprehending, his eyes beginning to water.













""I know I can't replace Lily, but, I--I want to be your mother, Hari. I--""













""You already are."" His voice was hoarse and he swore he could hear Ms. Amelia shushing a tearful Ms. Donna. Tonks was unabashedly blowing her nose, and subsequently being elbowed by a sniffling Susan.













""You--you've done more for me--You've taken care--You--Ms. Figg--""













Hari could no longer form a coherent sentence. His breaths became drowned out by his sobbs and he desperately flung himself at her, absently noting the soft drips he could feel falling in his hair. He could feel Tom in his head, mimicking a sensation that felt like Ms. Figg's fingers running through his hair.













""W-well then,"" she sniffled, and brought a hanky to her nose, ""I suppose it would be rather improper to keep addressing me as Ms. Figg, now wouldn't it?""













Hari huffed out a quiet, watery laugh and tried to recall the pronunciation he heard now multiple times a week.













""I--I suppo-pose so, Mamae.""







The others clapped for him and he was hugged tightly by each guest, with blessings and well wishes and whispers of congratulations! 













The rest of the afternoon was spent a tiny bit tearfully, with a foreign warmness to the house that Hari hoped never left.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













The excitement of the day gave Hari a guaranteed easy passage into sleep. However, he was not eased into dreams.













He was inside his mindscape again, only he couldn't sense Tom, so he knew he must be asleep.













    'But how can I be here and be asleep? Tom was with me all the other times.....' 













Hari rubbed at his eyes, causing the stars in his vision to crackle. He could feel more than see the tips of each one beginning to connect with wisps of what looked like a coloured black hole. He expected to be taken back to the snake-ladies' (lady's?) realm when his outward eye ""blinked,"" but instead he was shot into the middle of what he could only imagine as Hell.













There was the castle he recognized from Tom, yet it seemed to fade in and out of various states of disarray:













The castle would first appear as it had when Tom had introduced it--large, obtrusive, magnificent. Hari watched as the sky turned from a sleepy blue into a hazy grey, large creatures beating against the clouds and screeching just so that Hari's ear were ringing and he had begun to claw at them. Hari knew these creatures from Tom's scoffing about the follies of muggles who believed they could be so easily slain--these were dragons. The sky lit up in oranges, blues, and whites of dragonfire, allowing Hari to see the grounds covered in more bodies than he could begin to count, and he choked on the stench that assaulted him. Smoke filled the air, and Hari gasped at the mockery of a reprieve from the smell of rotting corpses, only to inhale and have his throat burned from the inside out.













The image swayed, and returned to the immaculate picture it had originally been, before a new horror descended upon it.













He do nothing more than watch, solidified in place,  as strange plants sprouted from the ground and grew at a rate Hari was vaguely sure not even chloromancy could accomplish. There had to be dozens that Hari hadn't a name for, in colours that reminded him of the dark parts of lakes no one ever swam to, or the frigid snow he had nearly frozen in. They covered the grounds, breaking up terrain and leaving terrible gashes in the earth, ploughing through the stone walls as if they weren't even there, leaving a crumbling castle in their wake. Faceless people began to burst from the large, ornate doors, and Hari couldn't even scream a warning at them before the plants opened up hundreds of dripping mouth on each tendril and struck like a snake in brush. Green-black syrup dripped from between thorny teeth, mingling with the deep red that stained what was left of the grasses beneath, and Hari didn't think he'd ever be able to get the screaming out of his head.













When Hari thought he was going to go mad from not being able to move--not being able to even speak, the image fizzled out and the scenery around him appeared as if the horrors he had just witnessed never existed.













Hari didn't know if the next scene was better or worse than the previous ones. The castle laid in ruins, bodies in school uniforms mingling with bodies in uniforms Hari recognized from St. Mungo's. This time, the bodies were twitching in and out of corporeality like the static on Ms--on  Mamae's telly. Bodies teleported all over the grounds with varying states of gore ripped from their bodies, viscera scattered around them, before disappearing and reappearing in a new place, and an entirely new state. Despite the carnage, everything was completely silent. Everything was cold. Everything was dark.













It started as soft as a breeze on his skin--the whispering. Voices began overlapping each other, trying to speak over one another, each begging Hari for something he couldn't understand. They grew impossibly loud, impossibly incoherent, drowning him, amd before he knew it he was falling through the mud-like layers of his mindscape.













He fell back into the bridge he could scarcely remember. The silks from her swarming around him and holding him close, trying to comfort him through the shrieking in his head. He could feel them mingling together, an overbearing presence in his mind that made him feel as if he were about to implode. Just when Hari thought he couldn't take anymore, his throat raw from begging, they mingled into one and spoke with the voice of the yellow snake--














""When hope turns to dust









And blood turns to rust









A child goes to war















When the blind can see









And so walks the lame









A child goes to war again















When fire fills the sky









And the Gods collide









A child goes to war.""














Hari opened his mouth to question, but was violently ripped from his mindscape by the sound of his Mamae's screaming.













~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~













""No, I will not let you take him!"" 













Ms. Figg  seemed quite insistent on letting someone named Dumbledore know that she wouldn't be letting him take Hari away.













""They would've let him die, Albus! How can you say he's better off there!?"" 













    The answering voice was too soft for Hari to understand, and he felt a tiny bit of shame seep through him as he opened the door completely silent and creeped down his hallway. The minute he saw his Mamae though, he almost wished he hadn't.













    Her hair fell in ratty tangles in a mockery of last night's curls, she was slumped over in her favourite green armchair, and she was crying. Hari didn't like it when she cried. He completely ignored the old man sitting across from her (ironically, in the seat Hari had sat himself hours a day earlier), barreling himself into his Mamae's chest and whispering quiet it's alrights into her tear-soaked blouse.













""Ah, Hari, my boy. I admit, I was hoping this wouldn't be the way we first met.""













    Hari turned on Ms. Figg's lap and spared the old man a glance.







    He was an odd-looking fellow, Hari thought. He had a rather impressive beard and mop of hair, both which were silver white and trailed past his navel. He was wearing a suit, which would have  looked as if it belonged on anyone else than this particular man if not for the appalling shade of yellow it sported. Hari fixed him with the nastiest look he could muster, one that mustn't of been too impressive with his sleep-stunted eyes and sniffling nose.













    ""My name is Albus Dumbledore, and I've come to take you home."" He fixed Hari with a gentle smile. Hari simply sniffed back.













    ""I am home.""













Dumbledore's smile grew stiff. ""Hari, my boy, to your real home. Your aunt and uncle miss you dreadfully.""









""My aunt put me in a hospital with half my arm melted off. Y'know, after she put me in the hospital for nearly forcing me to freeze to death.""















    Dumbledore dropped all attempts of a smile. Instead, he folded his hands in his lap and looked at Hari very seriously. Hari, in turn, could feel something cold pressing against what felt like the inside of his forehead.













    'Look away! He's a Legilimens.' 













Tom didn't have to tell him twice before Hari fixed his gaze on the odd periwinkle tie around Dumbledore's neck instead of anywhere on his face. The only indication that perhaps Dumbledore suspected Hari was purposefully avoiding him was a miniscule tightening to his features, before he put on another genial smile.













""Now, Hari, my boy, I'm sure you're exaggerating. We all know you've had some--trouble--in school."" Before Hari, or even Ms. Figg, could open their mouths to speak, Dumbledore raised a hand and continued.



















""You've put me in a precarious position, my boy, and I'm afraid I have no other alternatives. Either you willingly return to the Dursley house and be allowed entry to Hogwarts, or be forced back with your acceptance letter withheld.""













""Oh, Albus, you can't--""













""Now, now, Arabella, there are stakes in place you can't begin to imagine. Hari's relatives provide protection from Voldemort and his followers that even I can't replicate; that even Gringotts can't replicate.""













    Hari felt his Mamae go still, her arms wound tightly around him, as if she was afraid if she let go he would slip away. For all Hari knew, he would.













""But Albus--""













Hari knew they had lost from the tone in Ms. Figg's voice. She never sounded like that. He could feel Tom's scales bristling out, scraping against his mental walls as he whipped back and forth in a mockery of pacing.














    'I'll kill him. I don't care how--I'll kill him--'














Hari gently tuned out Tom's tirade and stood. He half-expected his Mamae's arms to reel around him like a vice, but they simply fell away as if they'd never been there.













    ""If--if I go with you, can I still see Ms. Figg?""













    Dumbledore gained a strange, almost satisfaction from Hari's question.













""Yes, yes of course, my boy.""













""And--and you'll keep them from hurting me?""













""Have no worries, my boy."" 













It didn't exactly quell Hari's fears, but he didn't think he'd get much more than that.













    ""I-I need to--to go pack. My th--""













""No need, my boy!"" My boy. Hari decided he quiet hated that phrase. ""Your relatives have assured me that they have everything you need.""













    ""Can I at least say goodbye?""













""My dear boy, what do you think this is?"" 













His smile was inviting but his words felt like tempered steel against Hari's soul.He turned and gave Ms. Figg one last hug, inhaling as deep as he could to try to memorize the way she smelled, the way she felt, and tried to forget the way she sounded when having her heart broken all over again. He stepped away and tried to take in the sight of their house--of her house--one last time, but he only caught a glimpse before he felt like a fishhook had slotted itself behind his navel and forced him away.













It was all too soon that he found himself back in front of the glaringly pristine front door of Number Four, Privet Drive. Dumbledore began to hum to himself as he patted down his coat, seemingly absent minded.













""I almost forgot! Here we are--"" He handed Hari a crisp envelope with large, curved letters that addressed it to one H. Potter. ""Your Hogwarts letter, dear boy.""



















""Oh, and Hari? One more thing.""













He looked at Dumbledore, who had procured a strange, bulbed wand from gods knew where. ""Just a bit of insurance, my boy.""













The last thing Hari knew before he was consumed by darkness was the tip of a wand pressed to his mid-forehead, and a whisper of a spell that sounded more like a betrayal.














""Obliviate.""

He knows he is an extraordinarily lucky child, to have always had some place that felt like home. Sometimes, he despairs of the fact that he's torn between two countries, and he's sure he's allowed that, but he has always had a home, and that is more than some children ever get. He is keenly aware that he is even more lucky that his parents were always there and attentive and loving, and knows that luck, already monumental, increased exponentially thanks to the fact that his family had money enough to keep him in clothes that fit and well fed and then some.

He knows he is immeasurably lucky to have even one home, but here he is, finding another.

Sirius is splayed out on the dormitory floor, making his crude attempt at starfishhood look elegant, while lecturing Peter, who's curled up in a little ball at the foot of his bed, looking twitchy and dissatisfied. Remus, never one to throw himself into the fray, is watching them from his seat on the windowsill, a lazy, contented smile on his face. James plops down next to Peter, throws an arm around his shoulders, and edges into what Sirius is calling their ""debate"", even though it seems awfully one sided to him.

""Yeah"", he says, ""maybe Petey can't beat you in a foot race, but he's a loads better friend than you are.""

Peter brightens up as Sirius frowns melodramatically, and James grins, ruffling Peter's hair.

Yeah, he thinks, this does feel like home."

Last Christmas, he'd asked for a children's potions set, a periwinkle silk cravat to match the one that Father wore, and a baby sister. Here it was, Halloween, and his wish for a sister was coming true. He took her picture from his trouser pocket; it was well worn as he looked at it periodically throughout his day and passed it around to every person he met. Lyra Malfoy-Potter had black hair and reddish-brown skin like Daddy and her eyes were two different colours, one blue and one violet. In her picture, she was giggling, and Cygnus counted five teeth. Cygnus was six years old and he could count up to 335, but Lyra did not have that many teeth.

Cygnus was waiting, somewhat impatiently, in the sitting room for Father and Daddy. It'd been three months since he'd gotten Lyra's picture from a Ministry owl, and that was a long enough time to wait. Today they were finally going to bring his sister home forever, which was why he was wearing his best wool cloak. Cygnus removed Daddy's wand from his sleeve, extinguished the lights, and got up to see what was taking so long. He found Father and Daddy in the kitchen. They were dressed in their own cloaks (Daddy had on the green scarf that made Father so happy), and they were hugging.

""Boo,"" said Cygnus.

Cygnus could see that Daddy was crying, so he lifted his arms to be picked up. He really was too old to be carried like a baby, but Father had explained that Halloween was a sad day for Daddy. Daddy picked him up, and Cygnus kissed his wet cheek.

""Don't be sad, Daddy.""

He knows his daughter has good taste, (he's mated to a Black too) but that still can't seem to quell his quiet sorrow. The room is still faintly scented of his lady-wife and his only child, his precious daughter, his miracle. The wedding is a show of an honestly disgusting amount of extravagance, and it's with a rueful chuckle that he's reminded of his adolescence and his wedding at the constantly moving hustle and bustle.


""Been chasing a pretty omega across Europe, eh?"" 



Charlus gripped the wood of the railing so hard that it might've splintered. It's a small mercy that he has tight control over his pheremones, because otherwise the whole yacht deck would reek of agitated alpha. A tight smile works its way across his face, and anyone who knows his smile, even his fake society mask, will know that this one is painfully fake. She has always just been 'Little Dorea' to him. To all of them. But when he stalks across Europe to find her, he cannot answer Heir Urquhart with honesty when he asks if he's been ""chasing some pretty omega across Europe"". After all, she has long since ceased to be 'some pretty omega'. She has ceased to be 'the young lady who entertains him'. She has eclipsed him entirely, she is all he yearns to chase after. He wants to mate her, he wants to scent her, he wants her familiar radiance about him every second of every day. She is not 'Petite Reine Dorea'. She is a daughter of the gods, divinely fair; and for some infuriating reason, she refuses to belive him. 



But today, she is simply a laughing memory that dances through his thoughts whenever his eyes close. Why must she continually elude him? His eyes rove over the now familiar streets and canals as everyone gets off at the pier; his peripheral vision alerting him to any passing ladies in blue or black. His eyes may have decieved him, but his nose won't. The scent Dorea possesses is unique in a way nobody else's is. Her scent was turpentine and oils, roses and nosegays, wet earth after rain. It drove him wild. His senses aching for the smallest taste of her aura, he lets himself pine over that which quite possibly will never come to be, if Heir Prince ""goes properly down on his knees"". 



He was roaming the streets of Venice aimlessly, squandering his time out on the continent, doing everything Dorea told him not to do. It was poor compensation for his lovelornity, and no amount of gelato and coffee and brandy will change that.  



It is precisely because they are not two flints that will ignite a flame, it is precisely because cool, shrewd Dorea will look at him with disgust, that he feels his control slip sharply between his fingers. She sends his thoughts whirling helplessly, she made him cling to every word she spoke. He knew when he was trying Dorea Black's famed temper, but he will provoke her, if only to see that delicious flush dance across her pale skin, like a wash of salmon watercolor on the priciest paper he could find for her. Whatever she said to him before she disappeared into the Swiss Alps was good advice, but that won't stop him from snorting in annoyance into his champagne once he's drunk.



When he asks her, when he knows (he thinks) he's being earnest, she dances out of his grasp once more. She will not be second to anyone in something again. Does it matter that he wants to feel her rapidly warming cheeks in his hands? Does it matter that the very sight of her evokes the flame that the embers of forgotten boyish flames will never be able to? Heir Prince is a lucky man, he thinks. He won't envy Rigel his lady-wife. 



Meeting her again wasn't what he expected it to be. He expected it to be an icy meeting between two old friends, an old connection thoroughly lost. He hadn't expected to be welcomed into her life with open arms, to feel the same compassion he'd felt years ago. Heir Charlus Potter should've been the name of someone who was long since dead to her. But that simply isn't true, and that makes him fall in love with her that much more. 



Dorea rushing to clean the place up, as if trying to remove the stain of her presence from the room, isn't something he expects to see.  'Raphaella, Little genius, what pain plagues you?' Rome took the vanity out of her, did it? He hears her nearly break down, the quivering in her voice and her tone.



""Well, I'm not an individual Charlus. I'm just a omega. Any other family would let me live, let me breathe. But not this one."" 



Mother Magic disagrees with her because he said so. He will convince her of that. Love isn't something that happens to you, but when you fall faster than you'd expect, tumbling and crashing like the highest waves, it can feel like it. ""Do you love him?""  He might kill himself if the answer is yes. He might kill himself if the answer is no.



Either way, he will have to live in a world where Dorea's laughs, her scent, her touches are all reserved for Rigel Prince, who is apparently-""rich, richer than you even."" Or he will have to drink himself to death, plagued by the fear that even if she doesn't love Rigel Prince, even if she still loves him, she chose to reserve her kisses and hugs and touches for 'dear old Rigel', simply because he had fooled himself into thinking he loved Lyra.  



The party in Paris three months later isn't just a scandal. It's an absolute disaster. 



He is so drunk that he can barely sense the people next to him. He lets Dorea fume at him, because it is well deserved. He will apologise to Raphaella for his behaviour tomorrow in the studio, but today, he is just an idiot who hurts her. He's shown her up, he's willfully ignored her because of his own fear.  ""Rigel Prince, ladies and gentlemen!"" It is ever so crass, and it humiliates her. He is so, so stubborn. Either he gets his way or nothing.  



The words are a fading memory now. Rigel Prince, goddammit. He will tear Rigel's throat out while he's shifted, he will pin him and make him cry out for mercy. He will have the satisfaction of a blooded death, since he cannot have her for his own, and it's all his fault. 



""Rich, richer than you even."" ""I've always known that I would marry rich, what is there to be ashamed of?""  



Charlus has never wanted for anything in his life, but now he feels twofold heartbreak, and the flickering flame of the love he had fooled himself into having for Lyra is nothing compared to the inferno Dorea has set loose within him. Dorea's laughter, her scream of fear when he fell through the ice, her society mask and her sincerity, her talent and her energy, her 'lack of genius', every one of those things he has witnessed. Rigel can't claim as much, can he? He still remembers the way Dorea would move him around and adjust the poses she wanted him to hold.



She has always been glorious, but seeing her run out of the weaving hall, moments after he tells her she's beautiful, only to kiss both of Rigel Prince's cheeks, to giggle when he serenades her with his friends, to hold his arms and walk through the manor gardens, he feels a resigned sort of weight settle in his soul. Vibrant and fair, elegant and exuberant, they look simply perfect for each other. Their strengths and talents play off of the other beautifully, he thinks. But he won't embarass Dorea anymore. He won't drown his anxious anger in wine. He'll submerge himself over his head in music, that the lonely bachelor may have something to sink into more than he already has. 



When news from across the atlantic makes Dorea long for company, it is long gone. Charlus, vowing to do some good with himself, apparently convinced that he cannot have her, has run all the way to Vienna. Cedrella is dead, and Dorea never got to say goodbye. Cedrella has disappeared from before her, and Dorea thinks she's let all the loves she's ever had in her life slip through her fingers. She won't let her father treat her like it's the dark ages. Her favorite person in the world died whelpng an heir for someone she didn't love. A mate she never wanted. She won't let her father tell her that a good omega would be willing to make sacrifices for their pack, for their family. She won't let her father sell her off to the richest man he can find. She's going to find Charlus and tell him that she doesn't hate him. She's going to tell Charlus that she's never despised him, and could never bring herself to. She will tell him he holds her heart, that she wants the best for him, for them. 



Charlus meanwhile, discovers that he is in over his head, and when the opera fails to give him the bittersweet comfort he hoped it would; he rips his pleasing chaos of pegasi, crest embroidered ribbons, peacocks and a charming and faceless lady to pieces. He will not be satisfied until the phantom of Dorea's voice has come to haunt him in the back of his mind, and he admits to himself that talent truly isn't genius, and no amount of energy, or even loverlike fury can make it so. Vienna proves itself to be useless, and once the pieces are sold and he sets out for finding a better place to hide his misery, Mother sends the painful news from back home. He feels his hopes continue to shatter. At least Dorea will find comfort in her lord- husband. He, on the other hand, has no idea where to run to next. 



Dorea tears through her papers, scribbling the volumes to him that she thought would come courtesy of Lyra, not her. But when comfort wraps its arms about you gently, you cannot help but strangle yourself within it until you feel yourself choking. The silks, the cross, the black ribbon in her hair-now left mostly open in the privacy of the Switzerland estate her cousin Alphard owns-everything about her was in the waiting game. 



There was nothing to do but wait. 



She could tell the world that she was fine with turning down Rigel's proposal now. She could finally say that it was for the best. She could also continue denying that she did it out of a pining, distant affection for ""the Potter boy"". But the barest trace of his scent in the garden would have her desperate to shift that exact moment, and meet him as fast as she could. She knew it. She'd fantasised about it plenty of times. When the moment comes, however, she can't do much but wait. She stands there, looking at him like she would like to drink him in like a fine wine and savor the feeling of his alpha aura for ages. When those familiar feelings crescendo in her soul once again, she doesn't have the heart to bury them again. She sends them out when she cries that she knew, she just knew he'd come to her. She hopes he will know she is sincere. 



The news is enough to stun him. Dorea has turned him down. She has turned Rigel Prince down. She has escaped from the insanity of her family, of a pack that mistreated her. There is almost something expectant in the way she looks up at him, the way her cross hammers over her skin because of her rapid pulse, the way she stares at him with wet lashes and sobs quietly enough that he can't hear her, but can feel her shaking in his embrace. He holds her tight, he tells her simply, that he cannot let her travel alone and unmated while having to care for herself. He cannot let her feel lonely and homesick when there is anything in his power he can do to remedy it; even if she does despise him. 



When she whispers that no, she doesn't despise him, when she whispers that she has turned Rigel Prince down, when she whispers that he is under no obligation to say or do anything, when she whispers that she's free, he briefly wonders if the grief of a friend's passing has driven him to invent a fantasy of a happy reality. Dorea's aura is beside him, clamouring for his attention, screaming otherwise. When he kisses her, he kisses her like it's the last time he'll ever see her. He kisses her like he's binding his soul to hers. He kisses her like the weeping watercolours that smudge and blur together in her paintings, into a single masterpiece. When he pulls back, he can hardly believe that this is what it's come to. He has her at last, and he won't rest until she is sure of that fact that she is never a second place, a replacement. He won't stop until he has scented her so strongly that she smells taken and safe and owned. He won't let go of her until he is sure, absolutely sure, that nothing can rip her away from him.  



The first time he takes Dorea to his home, the first time he whisks her away from Europe, the wonder in her eyes is spectacular. She spends hours painting and sketching the city in every hour of the day. He takes her on private tours of old forts and castles, out on the lake and around the bazaars. It's a lost heritage that becomes part of muggle society as time goes on, but the magical are insistent in their desire to preserve their history. Watching someone you love seeing something you know well with fresh eyes is incredible, Charlus thinks. The world around them vibrates with the energy of kings and queens from the eras gone by, and it is there that he thinks of a name for a baby girl, a sharp and talented one, one he would feel unworried handing the title to. 


Charlus snaps out of a year's worth of memories out on the continent when his darling daughter steps in for help. She's wearing her mother's wedding lehenga, and it had made his jaw drop when he saw Dorea in it. He wonders if it is possible for it to have the same effect on Sirius. He named her Jahanara for a reason. Queen of the world, and she truly looks the part. He won't scent her again. He won't see her for two months. He runs his fingers through her hair to tie it into an intricate low bun for the last time. When he hands her over to her chosen mate, someone she loves with her whole heart, to someone she trusts with her life, he cannot be upset with anything anymore. They've prevented history from repeating itself. Jahanara Cedrella is a Black now, and when crowds of friends and family congratulate them, the swelling sense of pride cannot be helped.

Petite Reine Dorea has birthed someone incredible. She's going to make something incredible of her life.  Charlus is assualted by memories of Rigel and Dorea's ill-fated courtship. He sees his mate running to someone who won't embarrass her, to someone who will love her and keep her contented for the rest of her life.


Rigel Prince, ladies and gentlemen! 



You are beautiful. 



Rich, richer than you are even. 


The feeling disappears quickly. Dorea is next to him today, and always will be. Their story is one that too many people know, a story with it's fair share of messes and accidents. But Dorea, calm, cool and loving Dorea, Dorea with her ebony hair and her warm gold eyes, Dorea with her laughter and her cutting comments and her talent, she will stand with him and stand by him forever."

For a long moment, Ron Weasley forgot to breathe. Harry - Harry Potter! - had been Sorted into Slytherin. Slytherin! The home of every Dark wizard for centuries. Dark lords were always Slytherins, everyone knew that. Only evil wizards were sent there. That was what his brothers had always said.

But Harry wasn't evil. 

Ron thought about how shy and scared Harry had looked sitting alone in the compartment, about how he didn't know anything about the magical world, about how he bought more sweets than Ron had ever seen in his life and shared them without even thinking about it. He remembered how Harry had refused to shake Malfoy's hand, and how he had stood up for Ron despite only knowing him a few hours, and for the first time a sliver of doubt wormed its way into his heart. 

Slytherins were evil, but Harry Potter was not.

""Weasley, Ronald.""

Ron started. He had completely forgotten about the Sorting. He stumbled over to the stool, almost collapsing onto it. The last thing he saw as the Hat dropped down over his face was a pair of terrified green eyes.


""My, my, you are an interesting lot this year.""


""What's that supposed to mean?"" Ron demanded. ""And why did you put Harry in Slytherin?""

""I believe we are here to talk about you, Mr. Weasley, not your classmates,"" said the Hat dryly. 


""But-""



""Yes, very interesting. A surprisingly logical mind; that does help with chess I suppose. Loyalty, oh yes, there is very little you wouldn't do for someone who has earned your trust. Even start to consider changing your mind about Slytherin.""


""What?"" Ron yelped. ""I haven't-""

""You students would do well to listen to my songs now and then,"" the Hat interrupted, and its voice was so firm that Ron fell silent. ""Slytherin does not deserve the reputation it currently bears.""


""But You-Know-Who was a Slytherin!""



""And many of his followers were Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, and Gryffindors, yes, even Gryffindors. Actually, the house least likely to turn out Dark wizards is Hufflepuff, but we are drifting from the matter at hand.""


Ron was silent for a minute. He could hardly believe what he was hearing, but it wasn't like the Sorting Hat had any reason to lie to him. ""Why are you telling me all this?"" he asked finally. ""I'm not going to stop talking to Harry, if that's what you're after.""


""I am glad to hear that, but as I said before, we are not here to talk about Harry Potter.""


It took a long moment to get it, then, ""You've got to be joking!""


""Not about this, Mr. Weasley.""



""There's never been a Weasley in Slytherin!""


""There has not,"" the Hat agreed. ""Unless you count Cedrella Weasley, though admittedly she was born a Black and married into your family. But then again, I thought you wanted to be out of your brothers' shadows?""

Ron's arguments died in his throat. The Hat took full advantage of his silence. ""You want to stand out from your family. You want to be known and respected for who you are. You have a good mind, when you choose to use it, and you are strong enough to choose your own path. You could do very well in Slytherin.""

Ron shook his head numbly, but a larger part of him than he would like to admit was actually considering it. It would be different. Certainly none of his brothers had done it. But what would they say? What would his parents say? The thought was as terrifying as it was intriguing.

The Hat was silent, and Ron somehow knew it wouldn't say anything else. This was his decision.

He had been told he was strong enough to choose his own path. Ron closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and did so.

Harry Potter was still reeling from the Sorting Hat's decision. He was a Slytherin. Voldemort, the man who killed his parents, had been a Slytherin. He had tried to argue when the Hat suggested it, but hadn't had a chance before it was bellowing its decision and sealing Harry's fate. He had barely registered the whispers that rippled through the Great Hall, or the frowns on some of the teachers' faces. He hadn't been able to look at Hagrid.

He had felt the derision coming from his new housemates though. No one had made space for him, and he had sunk onto the very end of the bench feeling like he was back in primary school, where everyone knew who he was, and no one would dare be friendly to him for risk of angering Dudley. Malfoy was whispering fiercely a few seats away, his grey eyes glittering, and Harry swallowed. He didn't exactly regret rejecting Malfoy on the train, not after the way he'd looked at Ron, but Harry had to admit that it was going to make life harder.

At least he had a chance with the other first-years, with the exception of Crabbe and Goyle.

Harry watched Ron sit to be Sorted with horribly mixed feelings. His friend had looked horrified, and Harry remembered with a pang what Ron had said on the train. Surely being a Slytherin couldn't matter that much. They could still be friends.

The brim of the Hat split open, and Harry's heart started pounding hard enough to hurt.

""SLYTHERIN!""

""What?""

""No!""

There was uproar, nearly as much as there had been when Harry had been Sorted. The rest of the Weasleys at the Gryffindor table were on their feet, all talking at the tops of their voices, and Professor McGonagall looked equally nonplussed.

Harry didn't care. He was so relieved he thought he might burst. Ron was in Slytherin. He wasn't alone.

Professor McGonagall recovered herself, and gave Ron a gentle push in the direction of the Slytherin table. Ron sank onto the bench next to Harry. His face was very pale, his freckles standing out in sharp relief, but he managed a weak grin.

""Fancy seeing you here.""

Harry laughed, and he didn't care that nerves made it sound hysterical. A first year a few seats away, Nott-something, rolled his eyes, and pointedly turned to talk to Malfoy, but Harry didn't care. Whatever happened now, they could handle it.

""I thought you wanted Gryffindor,"" he said, when he had caught his breath.

Ron shrugged. ""The Hat made some good arguments. And, well, at least people can tell me apart from the rest of them now.""

Despite his confident tone, Harry noticed that he was carefully avoiding looking at the Gryffindor table. The rest of the Weasleys had quietened, thanks to McGonagall's glare, but they all looked upset and confused, and Harry's stomach twisted.

""It'll be okay,"" he said quietly. ""You're still you, right? They can't...they have to know that.""

Ron gave a slightly queasy looking smile, and looked back towards the front of the Hall. Harry followed his gaze, and saw that the very last boy was being Sorted now. Nott huffed and looked up from examining his goblet with a bored scowl.

""Come on,"" he muttered. ""Everyone knows Zabini will be-""

""GRYFFINDOR!""

Nott dropped the goblet.

""What?"" Malfoy demanded.

He wasn't the only one. Students up and down the Slytherin table, and at the other tables for that matter, were exchanging startled whispers. Harry glanced at Ron, and was relieved to see that he, at least, looked as confused as he felt.

""Zabini,"" Ron muttered under his breath. ""I think I've heard that name somewhere...""

Harry shook his head. Nott threw them both an exasperated look and turned back to the head table without bothering to explain. Harry looked over to where Zabini was taking a seat next to Hermione Granger. He seemed perfectly at ease, even amused by the commotion he had caused. Even as Harry stared, Zabini caught his eye and gave him a bright smile, before turning to accept a welcoming handshake from Percy.

Harry stared a moment longer, before looking back at his own plate. What had that been about? He made a firm mental note to keep an eye on Zabini, but then Albus Dumbledore was rising to his feet, and Harry forgot everything else. He settled in, expecting one of the long speeches his primary school headmistress had been so fond of, but the wizarding world surprised him once again.

""Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!""

Harry found himself staring again, until Ron elbowed him. ""Harry, food!""

Harry had never seen so much food in his life, but even as he started helping himself to everything in arm's reach, he couldn't help but look back up at the staff table. Dumbledore was tucking merrily into some roast beef, his beard thrown back over his shoulder to keep it out the way. Harry swallowed.

""Ron, is the Headmaster, well...""

""Senile?"" suggested one of the older boys, leading to a round of snickers. Ron went bright red, but stuffed a forkful of turkey into his mouth instead of arguing. Harry let out a breath; he didn't want to start a fight on their very first night.

The girl on Harry's other side rolled her eyes. ""He's old, and the most powerful wizard in the country,"" she said dryly. ""Of course he's odd."" She caught Harry's eye, and held out a hand. ""Daphne Greengrass,"" she introduced herself. 

Harry shook it. ""Harry Potter.""

""We know,"" said the dark-skinned girl sitting opposite Daphne, but at least she smiled as she said it. ""I'm Tracey Davis."" She looked past him to Ron. ""Interesting to see a Weasley in Slytherin.""

Ron swallowed his food, and shrugged. ""Had to happen sooner or later.""

There was a snort from further up at the table, and Harry was somehow unsurprised to see Malfoy sneering. ""I don't know what Slytherin is coming to,"" he said. ""Blood-traitors, half-bloods. What's next, Mu-""

""Watch yourself, Malfoy,"" said Tracey. Her voice was quite polite, but her hand had drifted close to her wand. Her eyes flickered pointedly up to the head table. Malfoy sneered, but turned to continue his conversation with one of the upper years.

Harry had no idea what Malfoy was talking about, but the looks on Ron's and Tracey's faces were enough for him to glare at Malfoy. Tracey picked up her knife again, then looked Harry straight in the eye. 

""My father is a Muggle,"" she said clearly. ""Everyone already knows, it's no secret.""

""And my mother was a Muggle-born,"" said Harry, with a slow nod. He didn't understand why it made a difference, but he got that there was one. Next to him, Ron sighed.

""Forgot how seriously Slytherins take this stuff,"" he muttered. Then he shrugged, and took a jacket potato. ""Too late to change now.""

Daphne raised an eyebrow. ""It's not like you have anything to worry about,"" she pointed out.

Harry shot a questioning glance at Ron, who shook his head. ""I'll explain it all later,"" he promised. ""Go on, you need to eat more.""

He had a point, and Harry spent the next few minutes enjoying the best meal he had ever had in his life. He paid attention to the conversation around him though, quickly identifying fellow first-years Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson, and confirming that Malfoy was just as much of an arrogant prat as he had suspected. He was tuning out a story about flying in favour of reaching for the jug of pumpkin juice when Ron suddenly dropped his cutlery with a loud clatter. Harry looked up, and found himself face to face with a grim, blood-stained ghost.

Maybe it was just one shock too many after the day he had had, but Harry just stared back.

""Oh,"" he said. ""Hello. How do you do?""

Pansy let out a squeak, and scooted away from him up the bench. Harry glanced round, and saw everyone watching him in open-mouthed amazement. Malfoy in particular looked torn between screaming and running from the hall.

An odd, rasping noise drew Harry's attention back to the ghost. His gaunt face was twisted into a mocking grin, and Harry realised with a start that the noise was supposed to be laughter. After a very awkward moment, the ghost shook his head and looked back at Harry.

""Good evening, Harry Potter. I will be keeping a close eye on you.""

Harry swallowed and nodded. ""I, er, okay then.""

The ghost inclined his head, and strode off through the table towards the older students. Harry watched him go in bemusement, and then realised that everyone was gaping at him.

""What?""

Ron's face was slowly regaining its colour, but he still looked shaken. ""How did you do that?""

Harry could only shrug. After everything that had happened today, a bloody ghost didn't seem like such a big deal. Nott stared at him for a moment, then shook his head.

""Potter, that was the Bloody Baron. People don't talk to him.""

Harry felt the blush start to spread across his cheeks, and had to fight the urge to duck his head. He was getting tired of everyone looking at him. He started on his dinner again, despite no longer being hungry, and Ron followed suit after only a second's hesitation. Harry could feel the stares from the other first years, and older students for that matter, but he ignored them and eventually the various conversation around them resumed. He stabbed moodily at his untouched vegetables and sighed. At this rate, it was going to be a long seven years.

By the time the puddings had come and gone, Harry was struggling to keep his eyes open. He nearly groaned when Dumbledore stood up again, but the Headmaster's words were enough to wake him up.

""What does he mean, a most painful death?""

He was relieved when the other Slytherins looked as startled as he felt. Malfoy's mouth was already curling into a sneer, but Nott, Parkinson and the others were listening with the utmost attention. Harry glanced round the Great Hall. Some students seemed to be taking the warning as a bit of a joke, Ron's twin brothers included, but most were frowning as they listened. Blaise Zabini, Harry noticed, looked as thoughtful as Percy Weasley.

""Blimey,"" Ron whispered next to him. ""I know Charlie said he was a bit mental, but no one ever said anything like this.""

Harry swallowed. Just when he thought the year couldn't get any more complicated.

After a rendition of the school song that left Harry with even more doubts regarding the Headmaster's sanity, the feast finally came to an end. Full and sleepy, Harry and Ron followed the rest of their new housemates down a flight of stairs and along a number of twisting corridors before finally coming to an unremarkable stretch of wall. A tall, blonde girl glanced round and smiled at the first years.

""Make sure you remember this spot. Knowing the password won't do much good if you're talking to a normal wall.""

Harry frowned, but his confusion cleared when the girl turned back to the wall and said clearly, ""Wolfsbane.""

The wall slid aside, and Harry followed her through a stone archway into the Slytherin Common Room. At his shoulder, Ron gasped.

""Wow.""

That about summed up Harry's feelings too. He'd guessed they were underground from the amount of stairs they had taken, but he hadn't expected the windows that stretched from floor to ceiling and revealed the inky depths of the lake. The room was lit by torches and fireplaces that burned with strange green flames, and every decoration and piece of furniture spoke of understated elegance. It was a far cry from the fastidious modern fashions that Aunt Petunia favoured. Maybe that was why Harry immediately decided he liked it.

The older students scattered to the various chairs, or to their dormitories, with the exception of the blonde who had given the password. She had walked to the centre of the room, where she was joined by a slightly shorter Middle Eastern boy. They spoke quietly together for a minute, then the girl clapped her hands.

""All right, first years over here, please.""

Malfoy promptly pushed his way to the front. Harry caught Ron grumbling under his breath as they stopped next to Tracey Davies, who smiled at them before focusing on the older students.

""My name is Gemma Farley,"" said the girl, ""and this is Mohammed Shafiq. We are the fifth year prefects for Slytherin, and so we are the ones you can come to if you get into trouble.""

""Or if you simply want some advice,"" Shafiq added. There was a mischievous gleam in his dark eyes. ""Whatever you might have heard about Slytherins, we do look out for each other, whether that means standing up to the other houses, or just sharing some of our hard-earned wisdom."" He grinned. ""And trust me, you'll appreciate it after your first History of Magic lesson.""

Farley rolled her eyes. ""Very true. However, while we're on the topic of what you might have heard about Slytherins...""

But Harry never got to find that out. A dark figure had suddenly appeared in the archway, and silence immediately fell over the room. Glittering eyes met Harry's, and Harry had to resist the urge to step back. Not even Uncle Vernon had looked at him with such open dislike.

Farley recovered first, and inclined her head respectfully.

""Good evening, Professor Snape. We weren't expecting you.""

Snape's eyes left Harry's, and he moved forward until he was standing next to her. ""Good evening, Miss Farley. I will take it from here.""

Harry swallowed. Snape's voice was low and smooth, but there was an authority in it that caught and held the attention of everyone in the house. Both prefects stepped aside immediately, and Snape fixed gimlet eyes on the first years.

""You have been sorted into Slytherin House.""

His voice was so quiet that everyone had to strain to hear it. Harry hardly dared to breathe.

""If you are here, then somewhere within you lies the seeds of greatness. Slytherin will help you develop whatever gifts and talents you may possess, and allow you to pursue whatever ambitions you may hold."" He paused, and his eyes hardened. ""Provided, of course, that you do truly belong here.""

His eyes met Harry's, and there was no mistaking the disdain there. ""I expect nothing but the best from each and every one of you. Ignorance, and lack of understanding,"" his eyes flickered to Ron before returning to Harry, ""are no excuse. Should any student here bring shame or ridicule upon this house, I can assure you that the consequences will be...unpleasant.""

Harry glared back. He still wasn't sure why he was here, but the fact that Snape didn't seem to think he should be was enough to make his blood burn. He saw Snape's eyes narrow as the Professor continued, ""I expect your behaviour, and performance in class to be of credit to Slytherin, and to me. Anything else will not be tolerated."" His eyes glittered at Harry, even as his lip curled into a sneer. ""No matter how...celebrated the culprit may be.""

With that he nodded to the silent prefects and swept from the room, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry let out a slightly shaky breath. 

The whispering began the moment everyone was sure Snape was gone. Harry glanced round, and saw the older students exchange unreadable looks. Next to him, Ron shifted.

""That was weird,"" he muttered.

Harry just nodded. He felt it would be rather melodramatic to voice his suspicions that Snape already disliked him. They had never even spoken to each other. Shafiq cleared his throat, and Harry shook himself and returned his attention to the prefects.

""As Professor Snape so eloquently pointed out, we do have high expectations. However, we also understand that not everyone expected to be here."" His glance at Ron was much more welcoming than Snape's had been. ""We would much rather you come to us if you require any assistance, rather than embarrass yourselves in front of the other houses, whether that is in your studies, or in general wizarding matters.""

Harry frowned, not understanding what he meant by general wizarding matters. He would have to ask Ron. It was good to know the prefects were options if his friend couldn't help, but Harry was getting the impression that it was better not to let people know when you didn't know something in Slytherin.

Farley was nodding agreement. ""Exactly. Now, I know it's getting late, so we'll leave it there and you can come and see us if you have any questions."" She hesitated a moment, then straightened her shoulders. ""And no matter what you might have heard of Slytherin's reputation, we look after our own. No matter what political, personal, or familial disputes you might be involved in, you are all Slytherins now. Don't let us down.""

""No pressure,"" Ron whispered, but he looked more cheerful than he had while Snape had been around. Harry nodded, then found himself suppressing a yawn.

""Come on,"" he said. ""I'm exhausted.""

Yawning, they followed Shafiq and the other first year boys down yet another flight of stairs. Eventually Shafiq came to to a halt by a tall door, and glanced at them.

""All six of you will be in here this year,"" he said. ""All students share a dormitory until sixth year, when they may share a study between two, if Professor Snape agrees."" He smiled. ""Think of it as an incentive to not cause any trouble until then.""

Harry glanced at Malfoy, who looked horrified at the thought of having to share a room, and bit back his own grin. Shafiq stepped aside and waved them in. ""Breakfast starts at seven, and I'll be in the Common Room at ten to if you can't remember the way. If you want to sleep later, you'll have to ask one of the other prefects or older students to help you."" He paused. ""Not Burke. He doesn't function well in the mornings. But Professor Snape will be giving out your timetables, so make sure you do turn up. Anyway, sleep well.""

Malfoy promptly shoved past Nott so that he was the first one to enter, oblivious to the dark-haired boy's scowl. Harry gave Shafiq a smile as he passed, and was glad when it was returned, along with a clap on the back. He followed Nott through a short passage that emerged into a large circular room with six beds already made up. Each four-poster had deep green drapes, and looked so comfortable that Harry somehow felt even more tired. He stumbled towards the bed that had his trunk next to it, only to find his way blocked.

""Didn't expect to see you here, Potter,"" Malfoy spat. ""But since you are, I think now would be a good time-"" 

""Malfoy, the only thing I'm doing now is going to bed,"" Harry interrupted flatly. He raised an eyebrow. ""Unless you want to risk being late tomorrow and get into trouble on your first day?""

Malfoy hesitated, and Harry took the opportunity to slip past him. Ron folded his arms. ""We're going to be stuck together for the next five years,"" he said. ""How about we decide to leave each other alone in here, so that we can at least get separate rooms in the last couple of years, eh?"" His eyes glinted. ""Otherwise, I suppose having five elder brothers might come in handy.""

Malfoy's eyes narrowed, but Nott was nodding. ""Agreed. Nothing happens in here. I am not getting caught in the middle of anything, especially not something thought up by a Weasley.""

Ron nodded, winked at Harry, and turned back to Malfoy. Malfoy eyed him, eyes flickering between Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of the room, before his lip finally curled into a sneer. ""Fine, but you stay out of my way, Weasel."" 

Ron's jaw tightened, but Harry caught his eye and shook his head and the redhead visibly controlled himself. He claimed the bed next to Harry's, and under the guise of retrieving his pyjamas from his trunk whispered to Harry, ""Can you get up half an hour earlier tomorrow? There's some stuff you should know, now that we're here.""

""Of course,"" Harry agreed quickly. ""Thanks.""

Ron grinned at him. ""Don't mention it. We're going to have to watch out for each other.""

Warmth filled Harry's chest. He'd never had anyone watch out for him before, or anyone to watch out for for that matter. Ron winked and straightened up, and Harry turned back to his own trunk with renewed determination.

That Sorting Hat had said that he would do well in Slytherin. He was going to prove it right.

In the Gryffindor dormitories, safe in the privacy of his four poster bed, Blaise Zabini finally let his smile fade. He watched his shaking hands with abject detachment for a moment, then took a deep breath and reached for his quill.

His mother was not going to be pleased.

Apologies for the delay, the NHS is still ridiculously busy, but I hope you enjoy this chapter.

""Come on, Harry. One more time.""

Harry sighed, but just the thought of making a mistake in front of Malfoy was enough to halt any complaints. He closed his eyes, and dredged up the facts Ron had spent the last twenty minutes beating into his brain.

""Muggle-borns are witches and wizards born to non-magical parents. Half-bloods have a Muggle parent or grandparent. And people whose grandparents all have magic are purebloods.""

""But..."" Ron prompted.

Harry screwed up his face. ""But...the really crazy purists think that your blood is only pure if you don't have any Muggle blood in you at all."" He opened his eyes to frown at Ron. ""But how could they even know that?""

Ron shrugged. ""They're really obsessive about keeping track of their lineage. My Great-Aunt Muriel is a bit like that, but she doesn't really hate Muggles like they do.""

""She just thinks wizards are better.""

Ron looked away, mouth twisting into a scowl. ""There's a reason we visit as little as possible,"" he grumbled.

Harry winced. He knew what unpleasant aunts could be like. Ron continued to glare at the rug, and Harry leaned over to nudge him. ""Thanks for this, Ron. I never would have made sense of it all by myself.""

He had muddled through last night, but he knew the other Slytherins hadn't been fooled. Tracey and the other girls seemed nice enough, but Harry had had too much experience with bullies to give anyone ammunition. 

Even if he still couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. It was small consolation that Ron didn't seem to either. He glanced back over, and found his friend's ears had gone red at the compliment.

""No problem,"" Ron mumbled. ""We've got to stick together here.""

Harry smiled. It was going to take more than a day to get used to the idea of someone wanting to help him. Some of the warmth faded though as he thought more carefully about the previous night.

""The others... They really believe all this stuff, don't they?""

Ron waggled a hand in the air. ""Eh. Some more than others. Malfoy, definitely, but Tracey's a half-blood, like you, and Daphne doesn't seem to care. Guess we'll have to wait and see.""

Harry nodded, but that only led to more questions. ""Then why were they all being so nice to me?""

He hadn't wanted to question it, not after being hated all through primary school, but he was beginning to realise that he would need to be a lot more careful. Ron, though, was staring at him like he'd grown a second head, and Harry shifted in his chair. 

""What?""

""Mate, you're the Boy-Who-Lived!"" Ron spluttered. ""Of course they weren't going to try to piss you off. Except Malfoy, but he's an idiot,"" he amended. At Harry's evident confusion, he ran a hand through his hair. ""You don't get it. You-Know-Who, he's one of the most powerful Dark wizards to ever live. Everyone was terrified of him. We grew up hearing stories about how he fought a dozen Aurors at once and killed them all!""

Harry was growing more and more uncomfortable, but Ron didn't seem to notice. ""And it wasn't Dumbledore who stopped him. It was you.""

""But I didn't do anything,"" Harry protested. ""I was just a baby.""

""I know,"" said Ron quickly, ""but, Harry, no-one knows anything about you. No-one knows how strong you are, or if you have special powers or something.""

""But I don't!"" Harry protested. ""I didn't even know I had magic until a month ago!""

He had known things were bad, but he hadn't realised things were quite this extreme. Was this how everyone in the Wizarding world saw him? Even Ron when they first met had looked at him like he was someone special.

Ron's exuberance faded abruptly. He shifted in his chair, his expression suddenly uncertain. ""I don't mean it in a bad way,"" he mumbled. ""But that's how it is for us.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. He pushed aside his unease to think about that and swallowed. ""So they're scared of me. And that's why they're being nice to me.""

The words were bitter on his tongue. That was how people treated Dudley. Ron shook his head quickly. ""No, not like that. They just don't know what to expect. They're being careful."" He grinned suddenly. ""And I bet none of their families would be pleased to hear they got on your bad side on the very first day of school.""

Harry snorted, but he felt a bit better. He could understand them waiting to see what to make of him. He was doing the same thing really.

""Harry?""

Harry looked up to find Ron watching him rather warily. He cocked his head, and Ron sighed. ""I'm sorry. I didn't realise what it must be like.""

""It's okay,"" said Harry quietly. ""I think I understand now.""

The wizarding world wasn't as different from the Muggle one as he had first thought. Harry didn't know if that was a good thing or not, but as he looked at Ron's worried expression he found himself breathing easier. Ron was on his side. He smiled, and relaxed even more when Ron returned it.

He wasn't a scared outcast hiding from his cousin and his friends any more. This world was full of things he didn't understand, but that was okay. He and Ron could figure it out together.

""Well, aren't you two up early?""

Both boys spun round to see Gemma Farley coming up the stairs from the girls' dormitories. She dropped into the armchair opposite and smiled at them. ""How was your first night?""

""I slept like a log,"" Harry told her. ""The bed is a lot nicer than my one at home.""

""Good."" She finished tying back her long blonde hair, and gave them both an appraising look. ""Mo will be up in a few minutes, but do either of you have any questions for me?""

Harry shook his head. He had learned that lesson well enough at Privett Drive. Far better to try and work it out for himself, or else wait for someone else to ask the questions and then listen in. Ron, though, was nodding. 

""I did have one,"" he said. ""Say we had a problem with someone in our house, or they had one with us. Who should we talk to first?""

Farley sighed. ""Good question. Shafiq or I would be your best bet under most circumstances."" Her eye flickered to Harry before returning to Ron. ""We're the newest and most junior Prefects, and that means that you first years are our responsibility. I promise that we'll do everything we can to help you out.""

Harry relaxed slightly. If Snape really disliked him as much as he had seemed to the previous evening then the last thing Harry wanted to do was confide in him. Ron smiled, but it faded when Farley's gaze turned appraising. ""I have to ask, Ron. Are your family going to be all right with this?""

Ron dropped his gaze. ""Dunno,"" he muttered. ""I guess I'll see Percy and the twins today. I need to write to my parents though.""

""You can borrow my owl, if you want,"" Harry offered. He hesitated, then reached out to give Ron's shoulder an awkward pat. ""I'm sure it'll be fine.""

Ron didn't look convinced, but he managed a shaky smile. ""Thanks, Harry."" His shoulders slumped. ""Course, Percy probably already wrote to them last night, but I can still explain it better.""

Harry frowned, but his questions died on his lips as Daphne and Tracey bustled into the room. Nott was just behind them, his tie hanging loose around his neck, and he raised an eyebrow at Harry and Ron.

""So Crabbe and Goyle didn't kill you in your sleep and chuck your bodies in the lake.""

Ron snorted. ""I'd like to see them try. Having Fred and George around was good for some things.""

Nott cocked his head to one side and gave him an appraising look, but Tracey grinned. ""That must have been exciting. I wish I had siblings.""

""No, you don't,"" Daphne muttered. ""They're a pain in the neck.""

Tracey rolled her eyes. ""Yeah, you definitely weren't writing to Astoria last night.""

""Tracey!"" 

Harry bit the inside of his cheek to cover a grin, and saw Ron duck his head. Daphne scowled and folded her arms. ""I said I would,"" she said.

Ron shifted in his chair. ""Yeah, I promised my little sister I'd write to her too. She hates it when we all go away, and this is the first time I'm here too."" He looked down. ""Not sure she'll still want me to write when she hears about this.""

Harry swallowed. At least he knew he couldn't disappoint the Dursleys more than he already had. Daphne's scowl softened slightly. ""Have there been any non-Gryffindors in your family, Ron?""

Ron's smile was noticeably shaky. ""Not in living memory. And Aunt Muriel is really old.""

""You're still the same person you were yesterday,"" said Harry firmly. ""Your sister has to know that.""

Ron didn't look too convinced. Actually he seemed very interested in the carvings on the arm of the chair. Tracey frowned slightly, then turned to Harry. ""What about you, Harry? Will your guardians be happy?""

Harry snorted. ""They're Muggles. They couldn't care less about which house I'm in."" Tracey and Daphne exchanged a look, and Nott quirked an eyebrow, and Harry decided it was time to change the subject. ""What classes are you all looking forward to?""

Tracey's frown deepened, but before she could say anything Nott let out a jaw-cracking yawn. ""Personally, I like the sound of Charms,"" he drawled. ""Useful, practical, and far less complicated than Transfiguration.""

Harry nodded. He had looked through his textbooks over the summer, and the Transfiguration ones had just given him a headache. Ron pulled a face. ""Percy loves Transfiguration. If we get stuck he'll be very happy to help. If he still wants to talk to me,"" he added under his breath.

Daphne cocked her head to one side. ""Your brother's the newest Gryffindor Prefect, isn't he? That might be useful.""

""Or not,"" Ron muttered. ""He's been a nightmare all summer. Prefects aren't that great."" Farley raised an eyebrow, and Ron's ears went bright red. ""No offence.""

Farley shook her head, but there was a faint smile playing about her lips. More people were filling the Common Room now, some of whom cast curious looks over at the first years, but Harry did his best to ignore them. He was getting used to people gawping at him. Ron glanced at him, then glared round at the students.

""Gits,"" he muttered.

""Ron,"" said Farley lightly. 

""What? They are!""

""Its okay, Ron,"" Harry muttered. He could feel his cheeks heating up, but when he risked a glance up Tracey and Daphne were both frowning at the older students too. 

""That's just rude,"" said Daphne, with a sniff. ""Even Tori has better manners than that.""

She didn't bother keeping her voice low, and quite a few people looked away very quickly. Ron grinned at her. ""Nice one.""

Daphne inclined her head in acknowledgement. Nott shook his head and glanced at Farley. ""Is it time to go yet?""

Farley checked her watch, and at the same moment Shafiq stuck his head into the Common Room. He nodded to them and vanished again, and Farley smiled. ""A few minutes.""

Nott frowned, then his eyes gleamed. ""Can I go and watch?""

Harry blinked at him, but Tracey rolled her eyes and pulled them into a discussion on Quidditch. Ron joined in with enthusiasm, and the two of them lost Harry in seconds, but all conversation came to a halt when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle stumbled into the Common Room. All were up and dressed, but their hair was suspiciously wet and Harry smothered his laughter with an effort. Ron took one look and his eyes lit up, but Harry elbowed him in the side before he could say anything.

""We've got to deal with him for another seven years,"" he hissed. ""Let's not make things worse straight away.""

Ron pouted, but kept quiet. Malfoy stalked up to them, his thin face murderous. Daphne arched an eyebrow at him. ""Having trouble getting up, Draco?""

""That was completely unnecessary,"" Malfoy snarled. ""My father-""

""Knows exactly how Hogwarts works, Draco,"" said Shafiq cheerfully. ""Learn how to set an alarm instead of relying on a house-elf to do everything for you. Now, everyone who wants breakfast follow me.""

Harry didn't even try to stop grinning as he followed Shafiq back to the Great Hall. He had a great new friend, most of his new housemates were pretty nice, and Malfoy had been so busy glaring at Shafiq that he hadn't even looked at Harry or Ron. He was in such a good mood that he didn't even care about all the people who stopped and stared at him in the corridors, or about the whispers that seemed to follow him. 

Ron, however, was frowning.

""How long are they gonna keep doing that?""

""They'll get bored eventually,"" Daphne murmured. ""I hope."" She glanced at Harry. ""It might take some time though.""

Harry shrugged. He didn't like it, but there wasn't much he could do about it. It was the same as  being the only brown kid at school, and it was a rubbish feeling but he could deal with it. At least this time he had people on his side, and Ron and Daphne's indignation meant a lot.

It was even worse when they got to the Entrance Hall, but it was Ron who stopped short. Harry glanced at him, and saw that the blood had drained from his face.

""Ron?""

Ron swallowed. Harry followed his gaze and saw Fred and George bearing down on them. Neither of them looked happy. Shafiq gripped Ron's shoulder. ""You don't have to talk to them if you don't want to.""

""Yeah, I do,"" Ron whispered. He took a shaky breath and drew himself up. ""You go on. I'll be there in a minute.""

Shafiq held his gaze for a moment, then nodded and followed the rest of the first years. Harry, though, lingered. ""If you want me to go I will, but-""

""No,"" said Ron quickly. He managed a weak smile that Harry returned, but then the twins were there and Harry moved to stand at his friend's shoulder. Ron nodded to his brothers. ""All right, you two?""

One of them, George Harry thought, nodded but the other just glared. ""What the hell, Ron?""

""Fred-""

""Slytherin? You're a slimy Slytherin?""

""I'm still me,"" Ron protested. ""And Slytherins aren't all that bad!""

Fred shook his head, face twisted in disgust, but George laid a hand on his arm. ""Are you sure you're all right?"" he asked. ""You were dead set on going into Gryffindor with us.""

Ron hesitated. He looked at Harry, who nodded, and took a deep breath. ""The Hat said I could do well in Slytherin, and - and I want people to know who I am!""

The twins looked as startled by the sudden outburst as Harry felt, but no one got a chance to say anything before Ron continued, ""I'm never gonna be as smart as Bill or Percy, or as good at Quidditch as Charlie, or as funny as you two, and Ginny's the first girl in generations, but now... People might look at me and see me, and not just another Weasley.""

Harry stared at him. Ron had mentioned that he felt overshadowed by his brothers, but he had never expected him to admit to his family. Ron looked at him again and gave a small smile. ""And I couldn't leave Harry alone with Malfoy for seven years.""

Harry couldn't suppress a snort. ""Thanks, mate.""

Fred and George exchanged a long look. Harry could feel Ron trembling next to him, and realised he had to say something. ""The other Slytherins, they're okay,"" he said. He flinched as both twins glared at him. ""I mean, some of them have weird ideas, but they're not all evil.""

""Not yet,"" Fred muttered, but George was frowning.

""You're not evil,"" he said to Harry. ""And you're a lot of things, Ron, but you're not evil either.""

Ron eyed him. ""Thanks?""

Fred scowled at them, but before he could say anything a strident voice echoed through the Entrance Hall.

""Ron!""

Ron somehow went even paler. Harry glanced round and saw Percy Weasley stalking across to join them, his expression thunderous. Ron flinched back and Harry shifted in front of him without thinking about it, but to their joint astonishment Percy whirled on the twins.

""I told you not to gang up on him!""

""We weren't,"" George protested, but Percy was in full flow.

""I know you, and I heard you talking last night, and I told you that I am not going to stand by and let you make him miserable for making a decision for himself!""

Ron was staring at his brother like he had never seen him before. ""Percy...""

Both twins had flushed. Fred was pointedly glaring at the floor, but George's expression was more thoughtful. Percy rubbed his eyes. ""If you can't be supportive, just go.""

Fred's scowl darkened, and he stalked off in the direction of the Entrance Hall. George hesitated. ""We don't hate you,"" he said to Ron. ""Really. It's just a shock, you know?""

He patted Ron awkwardly on the head and left before Ron could reply. Percy sighed. ""They'll come round. They were expecting you to come and be with us in Gryffindor, and you took them by surprise. You know how they hate that.""

""Yeah,"" Ron mumbled. He squinted up at his brother. ""Why'd you do it? Not that I'm not grateful, but...""

He trailed off with an awkward shrug. Harry kept quiet and paid close attention. From what he had seen and what Ron had told him of the Weasleys, Percy was acting the complete opposite to what he had expected. Percy looked at the two of them and sighed.

""Because you're not the first one to have been offered Slytherin as an option.""

Harry stared at him. Ron's eyes had gone very wide. ""You?""

His voice was a squeak. Percy gave them a tired smile. ""Ravenclaw too,"" he said softly. ""But I was too scared. I asked for Gryffindor and everything was fine, but sometimes I wonder...""

He shook himself and clapped Ron on the shoulder. ""You might be the bravest one of us all. And don't worry about Mum and Dad. I wrote to them last night, but I don't think you need to worry.""

""Thanks, Percy,"" said Ron. If his eyes were suspiciously wet, Harry didn't mention it. Percy smiled at them, nodded to Harry, and followed the crowds into the Great Hall. Ron gave a shaky breath and leaned against the wall.

""Huh. That was weird.""

Harry shifted from foot to foot. He didn't have much experience comforting upset friends, or friends in general, but he had to do something. ""Are you all right?""

Ron blinked up at him, and gave a slightly shaky smile. ""Yeah. I think so."" He took a deep breath. ""Thanks, mate.""

""Any time,"" said Harry quietly. Then his stomach rumbled and he blushed. ""Sorry.""

Ron's stomach gave an answering, and even louder rumble. Harry and Ron looked at each other, and burst out laughing.

""C'mon,"" said Ron, when they had both caught their breath. ""Let's go eat.""  

They entered the Great Hall in far better spirits than Harry had expected. Tracey and Daphne had left spaces for them, and Harry smiled at them as he sat down. Tracey glanced at him. ""How did it go?""

Ron paused loading his plate with everything on the table long enough to nod. ""Better than I expected. I dunno how Mum and Dad will take it, but..."" He shrugged and turned his attention to his breakfast. ""Mm, these sausages are great!"" 

He offered Daphne the dish, but she shook her head. ""No, thank you. I'm Jewish.""

Ron's ears went bright red. ""Ah, sorry.""

""It's fine, you didn't know,"" said Daphne, as she helped herself to more scrambled eggs. ""Harry hasn't had any yet though.""

Harry smiled when Ron immediately tipped three sausages onto his plate. The Dursleys had never let him eat this well. Tracey pursed her lips. ""Don't forget some fruit,"" she said. ""Don't take this the wrong way, Harry, but you look like you could use some vitamins.""

""Probably,"" Harry agreed. Dudley and Uncle Vernon hated vegetables and anything even vaguely healthy, and Petunia had never really tried to change their minds. He took an apple and a banana to go with the fried food Ron was still piling onto his plate and Tracey nodded.

""Good."" She paused. ""Sorry. My dad's a doctor.""

""A what?"" Ron asked with his mouth full. Daphne and Tracey gave him identical disapproving looks, and Harry frowned.

""You don't have doctors?""

""Of course we do,"" said Daphne, tearing her gaze from Ron. ""We call them Healers though.""

Harry and Ron both nodded, but further conversation was interrupted by Snape making his way down from the teacher's table. He was carrying a stack of parchment and started to hand them out to each student. Harry glanced round and saw that other teachers, including Professor McGonagall, were doing the same at the other three tables.

""Wonder what we'll have first,"" Tracey murmured. 

""Hopefully not History of Magic,"" said Daphne. ""I've heard the teacher is a terrible bore.""

Harry honestly didn't care what they ended up doing. Magical classes had to be more interesting than maths. Daphne accepted her timetable from Snape with a polite smile, but Snape practically threw Harry's and Ron's at them and swept on without even looking at them. Startled, Harry blinked after him.

""Huh,"" said Ron under his breath. ""Guess he really doesn't like us.""

""That's strange,"" said Tracey. She was too was frowning after Snape. ""He's our head of house.""

From a couple of seats down, Malfoy snorted. ""Perhaps he just has good taste. Honestly, a Weasley in Slytherin? It's a disgrace."" 

Ron's hands clenched on his timetable and Harry glared down at Malfoy, but the blond wasn't finished, ""And Potter?""

The venom rolled off Harry's back, he was very used to it after all those years with the Dursleys, but Ron lurched to his feet. ""I swear, Malfoy, one more word-""

""No,"" said Nott. He had been ignoring them from Ron's other side, but now he reached up and pulled Ron back down. ""I'm hereby extending our 'no fighting in the dormitory rule' to here as well. If nothing else you'll lose us house points.""

""He's got a point,"" said Daphne. ""If you must get even, do it where the teachers can't see.""

Ron scowled, but he stopped glaring at Nott. ""Fine,"" he growled. ""But if he doesn't learn to shut his mouth..."" 

He trailed off, still grumbling under his breath, and Harry let out a breath. He really didn't want a fight before they had even had their first class, but warmth had flooded his chest at the speed with which Ron jumped to his defence. No one had ever done that before. No one had ever been wiling to risk getting in trouble with Dudley on his behalf.

Before he could say anything else though, a swarm of owls made their way into the Great Hall. Harry gaped.

""What?""

Ron followed his gaze. ""What? Oh, owls carry the post, remember?""

Harry did, and rubbed the back of his head. ""Oh, yeah.""

It was still fascinating to watch. Harry had never seen so many owls in his life. Hedwig broke off from the pack to land next to him, and Millicent leaned over with a smile.

""She's beautiful, Harry.""

""I know,"" said Harry proudly, and received a fond nibble from Hedwig in return. He fed her a piece of bacon and she flew off again, then he realised that Ron was watching the birds with undisguised wariness. ""Ron? You okay?""

Ron started. ""Yeah. Just wondering if Mum and Dad have written - Oh.""

A grey Screech Owl was heading in their direction. Ron went white, and untied the letter from its leg with shaking fingers. The owl nibbled his finger and flew off to where Percy was sitting at the Gryffindor table, leaving Ron staring at the letter.

""You might as well get it over with,"" said Daphne, not unkindly.

Ron gave a jerky nod, and tore it open. He scanned it quickly, then his shoulders slumped and he let out a long breath. Harry nudged him. ""Okay?"" he asked again.

Ron gave him a shaky smile. ""They say they're surprised, but they want me to be happy,"" he said softly. 

""That's great,"" said Harry fervently. He remembered how kind Mrs Weasley had been when he was trying to find the platform. He was glad Ron wouldn't have to deal with any more of his family being upset with his Sorting.

Part of him wondered what his own parents would have thought. Hagrid had mentioned that they had both been in Gryffindor. Would they have reacted the way Fred did? Or would they have accepted it like Ron's parents had? 

Those were questions he would never know the answers to, and he wrenched his attention away in time to hear Ron make a soft noise.

""Ginny wrote something too.""

Harry had spotted the childish scrawl at the bottom of the page, but Ron continued before he could try to decipher it, ""She wants to know everything. Says she knows all about Gryffindor, but no one's ever been able to tell her anything about Slytherin.""

""Just as long as you don't give away all our secrets,"" said Tracey, with a grin. ""Tell her she can find out for herself next year.""

Ron huffed out a laugh. ""Could do. She's tough enough.""

He read the letter again, then tucked it carefully into his robes, but once again Malfoy had been listening.

""Merlin, no. One Weasley here is bad enough.""

""Shut up, Draco,"" said Nott, without looking up from his plate. Harry placed a restraining hand on Ron's arm when his friend's ears went red, but Ron visibly swallowed his anger and picked up his cutlery again. Malfoy's lip curled.

""Taking the Weasel's side, Nott? And here I thought you had a brain.""

""Funny, I thought you knew how to be subtle,"" Nott drawled. ""Looks like we were both mistaken.""

Harry ignored the bickering. After the Dursleys, Malfoy was nothing. Nott shook his head, and returned to his breakfast, and Ron stabbed irritably at his bacon. ""Git,"" he muttered.

Daphne rolled her eyes, but Tracey nodded. ""Get used to it,"" she murmured. ""He's not going to change any time soon.""

Harry sighed. It was going to be a long seven years.

Much to Daphne's dismay, their first class was indeed History of Magic. Harry had been startled and impressed when Binns arrived via the blackboard, but his interest died a quick death. He had never known a ghost could be so boring. He and Ron spent the rest of the lesson playing hangman while the rest of the class talked, dozed, or stared into the distance.

""That was a nightmare,"" said Ron, as they headed for Transfiguration. ""How's anyone supposed to take notes when he talks like that?""

""Told you,"" said Daphne, grimly. ""Just read 'A History of Magic' before the exams, and use the class to do homework.""

Fortunately, Transfiguration was much more interesting. It was as complicated as Harry had been expecting, but at least they got to use their wands, and no one would even dream of not paying attention to McGonagall. None of them had succeeded in turning their matchsticks into needles by the end of the lesson, but Tracey and Nott both earned points for making the most progress so that was something.

Harry was more than ready for lunch by the time the bell rang, but something had been niggling at him and he hesitated. Ron raised an eyebrow at him, and Harry shook his head.

""You go on,"" he said softly. ""I want to ask McGonagall something.""

Ron still looked confused, but he nodded. ""I'll save you a space.""

Harry watched him go, then took a breath and walked up to the front of the class. McGonagall peered at him over her glasses. ""Yes, Mr. Potter?""

Harry swallowed. McGonagall was almost as intimidating as Snape. ""I was wondering if I could talk to you,"" he said, before he could lose his nerve, ""about my parents.""

Whatever McGonagall had been expecting, it clearly wasn't that. Her eyes widened slightly, and Harry hurried to explain, ""My aunt and uncle never talked about them. I don't know anything about them except what Hagrid told me, but he mentioned that they were both in Gryffindor and as you're the Head of Gryffindor, I just thought, well...""

He trailed off, feeling his cheeks heat up, but McGonagall's severe expression had softened considerably. ""As it so happens, I knew your parents very well,"" she said softly. ""Both during their time at Hogwarts, and during the war."" She gave a slight smile. ""They were wonderful people, and very talented. Your father was one of the finest Transfiguration students I have ever had the pleasure of teaching, and your mother was a marvel at both Charms and Potions.""

Harry was hanging on her every word. Hagrid had told him a bit, but he wanted to know everything he possibly could. McGonagall shook her head slightly and refocused on him. ""Unfortunately I have a number of matters I need to attend to, but I will be available on Saturday morning.""

""That would be great!"" It came out a little fast, but Harry couldn't help himself. ""Thank you.""

McGonagall smiled at him. ""It would be my pleasure."" She paused. ""You might also want to talk to Professor Flitwick. Lily was considering pursuing an apprenticeship in Charms after the war.""

""I'll do that,"" said Harry. He hadn't had Charms yet, but he was looking forward to it. ""Thank you, Professor.""

""You are very welcome, Mr. Potter."" She straightened the papers on her desk and rose to her feet. ""Now, I suggest you head to lunch.""

Harry's stomach rumbled, and he blushed. ""Yes, Professor.""

He left the classroom with a spring in his step. So far, his life at Hogwarts was looking far brighter than the one he had left behind.

Harry really, really loved Hogwarts.

It was a lot to get used to, of course. Magical lessons were very different to those at his old primary school. Charms and Astronomy were a long way from Maths and English, and working in Aunt Petunia's garden hadn't prepared Harry in the least for the magical plants that Hogwarts had to offer.

Then there were the other students. The older Slytherins usually ignored them, which Harry honestly preferred over the looks and glares he got otherwise. The other houses weren't much better, and being stared at because his parents were murdered got old fast. The other first years weren't so bad, especially those who had grown up in the Muggle world like Harry, but they seemed wary of Slytherins in general.

Harry didn't see what their problem was. Yeah, the older students were scary, and Malfoy was a loud-mouthed prat, but the others? It was hard to be scared of Nott when he spent his evenings buried in a thick fantasy book, or find Millie intimidating when she played with her kitten in front of the fire every night. Pansy had a razor-sharp tongue, but she helped Crabbe and Goyle with their homework every night, no matter how many times she had to explain things, and Tracey and Daphne might be reserved in front of the rest of the school, but they taught Harry Exploding Snap and Gobstones and never once made fun of him for his ignorance.

And there was Ron. Ron was loud and brash and stubborn and the best friend Harry had ever had. Ron didn't have much, and he was nearly as lost in Slytherin as Harry felt, but he shared what he did have and he did his best to explain whenever Harry was lost in the world he was now part of, and he was loyal and kind and Harry was glad they were friends.

All in all, life at Hogwarts was far better than the one Harry had left behind.

Still, Harry was looking forward to his first weekend. It had been a long week of classes, and by the time Harry and Ron made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast on Friday morning they were all ready for a break.

""I can't wait for the weekend,"" said Ron, as he slumped onto the bench and started pouring out pumpkin juice. ""They don't believe in starting us off easy, do they?""

""We're here to learn, Weasley,"" said Nott. ""Just wait until we get to fifth year.""

Ron rolled his eyes, but Harry was more interested in the arrival of the post owls. He hadn't received any letters yet, but he hadn't been expecting any and it was nice to see Hedwig anyway.

It was something of a shock, therefore, when Hedwig swooped down with a note tied to her leg.

""Oh, look,"" Malfoy called. ""Someone finally wrote to Potter.""

""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Ron, without looking at him. ""Who's it from, Harry?""

Harry scanned the short note and smiled. ""It's from Hagrid. He's invited me to tea this afternoon.""

Warmth spread through his chest. He hadn't heard from Hagrid since his sorting, and he had been worrying a bit. Ron leaned over to look at the note.

""That's cool. Reckon it would be okay if I come along? Charlie really liked Hagrid.""

""I don't think he'd mind then,"" said Harry.

He scribbled his reply on the back of the note, fed Hedwig a piece of bacon, and sent her off again. ""It'll be nice to see him.""

Malfoy muttered something to Crabbe and Goyle, both of whom broke out into grunts of laughter, but Harry ignored him. He was getting very good at that. Daphne rolled her eyes, and Tracey passed over the jam with a sniff.

""We've got to get through Potions first,"" she reminded them. ""It should be interesting; Snape's supposed to be a good teacher.""

Ron snorted, then winced when both Tracey and Daphne frowned at him. ""Sorry, but I've heard different things from my brothers.""

""Of course you have,"" Nott drawled. ""They're Gryffindors.""

""So?"" Ron demanded. ""Shouldn't make a difference, should it? McGonagall doesn't treat us any differently than the Gryffindors.""

Nott just rolled his eyes and turned back to his porridge, but Harry frowned. ""Is that why Mo told us to read our Potions book last night?""

He had wondered why the Prefects had told them to work on a subject they hadn't even had yet, but if Snape was going to be a temperamental teacher then he was glad of the warning. Daphne quirked an eyebrow.

""Probably. He must expect us to set a good example. You heard him on the first night.""

Harry shivered. He hadn't spoken to Snape at all, but he hadn't forgotten how Snape had looked at them. At him. The last thing he wanted was to get on his Head of House's bad side.

With that in mind, the first-year Slytherins made sure to be waiting outside the dungeons in good time. The Gryffindors arrived soon after. They stayed on the other side of the corridor, their expressions wary, with the exception of Blaise Zabini. He had been talking quietly with Neville Longbottom as they came down the stairs, but he broke off to nod to the waiting group of Slytherins.

""Good morning.""

Daphne and Tracey returned the greeting, and Nott nodded as amicably as he ever did, but Malfoy's lip curled. ""Zabini,"" he said. ""Still here? I'd have gone home in shame.""

Harry frowned, but Zabini just quirked an eyebrow. ""Yes, well, you would know about being an embarrassment, wouldn't you, Draco?""

Malfoy spluttered, his pale cheeks flushing, but Zabini had already turned to Harry. ""Please excuse me. Draco and I have loathed each other since childhood.""

Ron snorted, and Harry grinned at him. ""I can't imagine why."" He held out his hand. ""Harry Potter.""

""I know,"" said Zabini, but the spark of amusement in his dark eyes as he shook Harry's hand eased any sting from his words. ""It's a pleasure to meet you."" Harry nodded, and he looked at Ron. ""Ron, right? I've met your brothers.""

Harry caught the odd note in his voice at the same time Ron winced. ""Sorry about that. They can be a bit, uh...""

He trailed off with a helpless shrug, and Zabini laughed. ""Yeah, that.""

Ron grimaced again, the tips of his ears blazing red, and from the other side of the corridor Hermione Granger sniffed. ""They have been very rude,"" she said. ""I still think you should talk to someone about it, Blaise.""

Zabini shot her a brief smile. ""They're only messing about. They'll get tired of it sooner or later.""

Hermione shook her head, and Ron's frown deepened. ""Sorry,"" he said again. ""I'll talk to them."" He pulled a face. ""Can't promise they'll listen, mind...""

Zabini shot him a long look, but even as he opened his mouth the door to the dungeons swung open. Hermione jumped and immediately hurried inside, and Zabini and Neville joined the rest of the Gryffindors trailing after her. Ron stepped forward, but Harry caught his arm.

""Why were you apologising?""

Ron hesitated, then shrugged. ""Told you, the twins can be a bit...sharp, I guess. If they like you they're great, but if they don't...""

He trailed off with another shrug. Harry frowned. ""But how did you know that they wouldn't like Zabini?""

Ron bit his lip, then shook his head. ""Tell you later. C'mon, we really don't want to be late.""

Now afire with curiosity, Harry followed him into the classroom. Most of their classmates had already taken their seats, the Gryffindors on one side of the room, and the Slytherins on the other, and he and Ron found a space near the back. Harry pulled out parchment and a quill, and finally looked to the front of the room.

Snape glared down at the class. His black eyes travelled slowly round the room, and Harry had to fight the urge to fidget. He hadn't interacted with his Head of House since getting his timetable, and he had no idea what to expect.

Snape rose to his feet, and Harry sat up straight. He got the feeling that not paying attention would be a very bad idea.

He was a compelling speaker. There was no denying that. Harry had liked the look of Potions when he first read through his books over the summer, but the way Snape spoke about it was something else. Snape had a knack for holding a class' attention, and his passion for his subject brought the rather dry pictures painted by the textbook to life.

""Potter.""

Harry jumped, startled by the sudden switch to animosity, but Snape didn't give him a chance to adapt, ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""

Hermione's hand shot into the air, but Harry could only gape. He hadn't been expecting a challenge straight away, and for a horrible moment his mind went completely blank, but then the hours Mo had spent with them the previous night came flooding back.

""Um, a sleeping potion? The, um, the Draught of Living Death,"" he clarified, when Snape's eyes narrowed.

The Potions Master continued to glare at him, and Harry had a sudden terror that he'd got it wrong, but Ron had relaxed and Tracey was grinning at him from the row in front. Hermione had put her hand down with obvious disappointment, but even as Harry let out a breath Snape's eyes narrowed.

""And where would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?""

That one Harry did remember, mainly for how disgusted Malfoy had looked when he learned it, and he was able to answer more confidently, ""The stomach of a goat, sir.""

He knew it was right, Zabini and Daphne were nodding along with Tracey, but Snape was still glaring as fiercely as ever. His lip curled as he met Harry's gaze, and for a moment his expression was so reminiscent of Aunt Petunia that Harry had to fight a shudder.

Snape twitched.

Only for a split-second, and so faintly that Harry was sure no-one else had spotted it, but something changed. Harry shook himself, and Snape switched his glare to the Gryffindors.

""Longbottom,"" he snarled. ""What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?""

Neville's face went white. He stared up at Snape in outright terror, and Harry's stomach clenched in sympathy. Hermione's hand was once again in the air, but Snape continued to ignore her in favour of his new target. Even from across the classroom Harry could see Neville trembling, but before he could work out what to do Zabini leaned over to bump his shoulder against Neville's.

Neville jumped, distracted from Snape's glare, and at Zabini's nod he seemed to find his voice. He mumbled something, and Snape's glower darkened.

""Speak up, boy.""

Neville took a shaky breath. ""They're-they're the same plant, sir.""

Snape blinked. Neville glanced at Zabini, and straightened a little at the other boy's smile. ""It's also known as aconite,"" he said.

Harry looked at Neville with new respect. He hadn't known that one, and he certainly hadn't known that it had yet another name. Judging from the startled faces around him, no one else had expected that from Neville either.

Snape, however, did not look impressed. He glared down at Neville with almost as much venom as he had at Harry, but even as Neville shrank back, Snape turned away with a twitch of his robes.

""I expect you all to maintain these standards.""

Harry shivered at the implicit threat, and resolved to study his Potions book until he knew it by heart. The last thing he needed was to give his head of house any more reasons to hate him.

Snape waved his wand and a set of instructions appeared on the board.

""You will be making a potion to cure boils. I trust you can all follow instructions?"" He glared down the people who dared nod, and continued, ""You should have the required ingredients. Proceed.""

Ron immediately started pulling ingredients out of his kit, but Harry caught his arm. ""Hang on, we should read it all first, so we know what we're doing. That's what I always do when I'm following a recipe,"" he added, when Ron frowned at him.

Ron shrugged. ""Fair enough."" He squinted at the board. ""Doesn't look too hard. You want to chop while I measure things?""

Harry relaxed a little as they set about their work. Handling Potions ingredients wasn't that different from food, and as antagonistic though he might be, Snape's instructions were clear and easy to follow. Snape himself paced the classroom, complimenting Malfoy and the other Slytherins and criticising the Gryffindors, but he passed by Harry and Ron without a word.

""He's starting to creep me out,"" Ron whispered, as Snape once again stalked past them. ""Our horned slugs look just as good as Malfoy's.""

Harry was opening his mouth to reply when there was a yelp from the front of the class. He looked up in time to see Zabini apologising profusely as he took some porcupine quills from Neville's shaking hand.

""Sorry, Neville, I didn't mean to startle you, but we need to take the cauldron off the heat first-""

""What is going on here?""

Neville jumped, but Harry saw Zabini flinch before it was hidden by his usual polite smile. ""Nothing, Professor. We're sorry to disturb the class.""

Snape's lip curled. ""I expected better of you, Zabini. A point each from Gryffindor for failing to read instructions properly.""

Zabini dropped his gaze to the floor. ""Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.""

Snape snorted and swept on. Ron let out a breath. ""Blimey. Doesn't let anything go, does he?""

Harry, who had seen Pansy stop Crabbe and Goyle for making far more stupid mistakes, gritted his teeth. ""Not if they're Gryffindors.""

""Git,"" Ron muttered, but he was careful to make sure Snape was out of earshot first.

Harry took a deep breath. The sooner they were done with this the better.

The rest of the class passed without incident. Harry and Ron double-checked every single line of the instructions before they did anything, and their potion ended up more or less the right colour and texture it should be, but Snape didn't even acknowledge them when they brought him a sample. Only once they had fled the classroom did Harry let himself breathe.

""That was different.""

""I'll say,"" Ron growled. ""What's his problem?""

Harry shook his head. He didn't know, but somehow he was going to find out.

His attention was diverted though when Neville and Zabini left the classroom. Both looked exhausted, and Harry shook his head as he passed.

""I think I'm glad the Hat didn't put me in Gryffindor.""

If Snape treated him this badly as a Slytherin, Harry dreaded to think what he'd have been like in any other circumstances. Zabini caught his eye, and pulled a face.

""Well, that was fun,"" he said. ""Can't wait to do it every week for the next five years.""

Harry snorted. ""Yeah, that was..."" He trailed off with a shrug. Neville shuddered.

""I'm sorry, Blaise,"" he said miserably. ""I did read the instructions, but he made me so nervous.""

""It's not your fault,"" said Zabini, in a tone that suggested he'd said it more than once since the accident. ""Other people made mistakes and he didn't snap at them.""

""I know I'm not going to be working near Goyle any time soon,"" said Ron. ""He'd have gassed us all if Pansy hadn't been there.""

Zabini smirked at him. ""Ah well, we survived. Hope there's something good for lunch.""

Harry kept an eye on Neville as they made their way up to the Great Hall. Zabini seemed to have shaken off Snape's venom, but Neville was still pale and downcast. Harry wracked his brain for something to take his mind off things.

""How's your toad, Neville?""

Neville blinked. ""He's...he's good. I have to keep him out of the shower now.""

""You really do,"" Zabini muttered. ""Seamus almost stepped on him yesterday.""

""He keeps getting away from me,"" said Neville with a sigh. ""I never knew toads could move that fast.""

Ron pulled a face. ""I'm lucky Scabbers is so lazy. I'd never be able to catch a rat.""

Harry smiled at the image, and Zabini chuckled. ""There are easier pets to handle.""

""You got that right,"" Ron muttered. ""Hedwig is brilliant."" Harry beamed, and Ron glanced at Zabini. ""Have you got any pets?""

""No,"" said Zabini, after a pause. ""My mother doesn't like animals."" His face twisted into a grimace. ""I was hoping to be able to talk her into it, but she's definitely not going to change her mind now that I'm a Gryffindor.""

""That's stupid,"" said Ron hotly. ""She's your mum. If mine can accept me as a Slytherin, yours can get over you being a Gryffindor.""

Zabini just looked down at his shoes. Harry was desperate to ask why even his mother thought Zabini should have been a Slytherin, but he swallowed the urge down. Zabini didn't look like he wanted to talk about it. Ron's frown deepened, but then they came out into the Entrance Hall and Neville grabbed Zabini's arm.

""We'd better find the others. See you later, Harry, Ron.""

""Bye,"" Harry called, as the pair vanished into the crowds. He stared after them, then turned to Ron. ""Okay, what's going on with Zabini?""

Ron ran a hand through his hair. ""It's, uh, a bit weird.""

""Everything here is a bit weird,"" said Harry flatly. ""Come on, Ron, I can't be the only one who doesn't know.""

""The Muggleborns probably don't know either,"" Ron muttered. ""Fine,"" he added, when Harry glared at him. He thought for a moment. ""Okay, does the Muggle world has people that, uh, everyone thinks they're kind of suspicious but no-one's ever accused them of anything?""

Harry frowned, then remembered some of Aunt Petunia's gossip and Uncle Vernon's comments on certain politicians and nodded. ""I suppose so.""

Ron shifted from foot to foot. ""Right,"" he mumbled. ""Thing is, Zabini's mum, she's been married a few times."" He paused. ""Five times, actually. And every time they die soon after.""

Harry put the pieces together and his jaw dropped. ""And people think she killed them all?""

It came out a little louder than he had intended, and Ron dragged him over to the side of the room. ""Keep your voice down,"" he hissed. ""No one knows for sure, or someone would have done something, but everyone says it's weird that every time she marries someone rich they die and leave her a lot of money.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. His stomach twisted uncomfortably. ""So people think that because his mum might have killed people, that he should be a Slytherin?""

Ron dropped his gaze. ""Yeah,"" he mumbled. ""Come on, Harry, you know Slytherins have a bad reputation, and even if she's not from here she's rich enough to know Malfoy and all the other pureblood families-""

""That's not the point! Why does everyone think Slytherin is just for evil people?""

Ron gave him a helpless shrug. Harry gritted his teeth. ""This is stupid,"" he fumed. ""Malfoy's a git, but everyone else has been fine. I don't know what's going on with Blaise's mum, but Blaise is nice enough."" He shook his head. ""It's stupid,"" he finished.

Ron stared at him for a long moment, then ran a hand through his hair. ""You're right,"" he said. ""It is."" He stared down at his shoes, then took a breath and looked up. ""And it's not fair.""

Harry's hands clenched into fists. He had spent years being hated for who he was. He wasn't going to spend the next seven years letting people think he was evil. He looked Ron straight in the eye.

""Maybe we can do something about that.""

Ron's eyes went very wide. He swallowed hard, then his jaw set and he nodded. ""I was going to prove it to Fred anyway. Might as well prove it to everyone.""

It took a moment for the words to sink in, and then warmth flooded Harry's chest. ""Thank you.""

Ron's beaming smile lit up the Entrance Hall. ""Any time."" He flung an arm around Harry's shoulders. ""C'mon. Can't fix the world on an empty stomach.""

Harry had to laugh.

Lunch was good, and even better with the knowledge that they were free from classes until Monday. Malfoy had continued to gloat about his performance in Potions, but Harry and Ron both ignored him. So did Daphne; she instead leaned over to talk to Harry.

""Have you spoken to Professor Snape at all, Harry?""

""Nope,"" said Harry in between bites of his lunch. ""Those questions in class were the first time.""

Daphne's frown deepened. Tracey looked up from her shepherd's pie. ""Are you sure you haven't offended him or something?""

""How can I have offended him when I've never spoken to him?""

The two girls shrugged. Ron washed a mouthful of food down with some pumpkin juice and straightened. ""Maybe you could ask Professor McGonagall tomorrow. Bill always said she was really helpful.""

""Maybe,"" said Harry quietly. He had a feeling that talking about his head of house with another teacher wouldn't go down very well. He sighed and turned back to his dinner. ""I'll think about it.""

Daphne pulled a face, but changed the subject. ""Do you have plans for the afternoon?""

""Homework,"" said Tracey promptly. ""I know,"" she said, when Ron choked on his pie, ""but I'd rather get it out the way now than have to do it over the weekend.""

Ron shuddered, and Harry grinned. ""We're going to visit Hagrid.""

""The gamekeeper, Potter? Really?""

""Shut up, Malfoy,"" said Ron, without looking at him. ""He's better company than you.""

""You would say that, weasel,"" Malfoy sneered. ""You're used to associating with the servants.""

Ron started to lurch upright, face flushing, and Harry caught his arm. ""He's not worth it,"" he said firmly. ""Let's just finish eating so we can go and see Hagrid.""

Ron glared at Malfoy a moment longer, then sank back onto the bench. Tracey sighed. ""You can't let him get to you.""

""Easy for you to say,"" Ron muttered, then caught himself. ""Sorry.""

Malfoy muttered something that had Crabbe and Goyle breaking into snorts of laughter. Harry just rolled his eyes, and refilled Ron's and Tracey's goblets. Dudley had given him plenty of practice ignoring bullies, even if Malfoy was worse than Dudley had ever been.

They managed to finish lunch without further incident though, and Harry wasted no time dragging Ron out into the grounds. His friend was still fuming, but his mood brightened as they made their way down to Hagrid's hut.

""Charlie really likes Hagrid. Helps that they're both mad about dragons.""

Harry snorted. ""He said that he wanted one. I'd like to see one.""

""Me too,"" said Ron. ""Maybe one day.""

Harry smiled, but the closer they got to Hagrid's hut the more he was beginning to worry. Hagrid's words about all the bad witches and wizards who had come from Slytherin rang in his ears. He didn't want to think that Hagrid would turn against him, but having seen how people reacted to Slytherins he and to wonder.

Hagrid had been the first person to openly like him. Harry didn't want that to change.

""Harry?""

Harry blinked, and realised they were standing outside Hagrid's hut. His stomach clenched, but he took a deep breath and knocked on the door.

Almost immediately the sound of barking echoed from inside, and Hagrid's even louder voice sounded through the wood,

""Down, Fang, yer daft thing.""

Harry just had time to exchange a bemused look with Ron before the door swung open and Hagrid beamed down at him. ""Harry, good t'see yeh.""

Relief crashed over him, and Harry smiled back. ""You too, Hagrid. This is my friend, Ron.""

""Nice to meet you,"" said Ron. He was staring up at Hagrid with wide eyes, and staggered when Hagrid clapped him lightly on the back.

""Another Weasley, eh? I remember yer brothers. Come in, both o' you.""

They entered, and Hagrid waved them to chairs so tall they went both left swinging their feet while he made tea. Fang turned out to be an enormous boar hound that slobbered over both of them before flopping down into a giant basket.

""How are yeh findin' Hogwarts?"" Hagrid asked. ""Classes all right?""

""It's brilliant,"" said Harry. ""It's a lot to learn, but everyone's been great. Most people anyway,"" he amended, when Ron snorted.

Hagrid gave him a knowing look as he set down the mugs. ""Slytherin, eh? That was somethin' else.""

Harry gave a slightly awkward shrug. Next to him, Ron shifted in his chair. Hagrid looked at the two of them, and his smile faded. ""Yer both stayin' safe there?""

""They're not all evil,"" Harry pointed out. ""Most of them are fine.""

""Maybe now,"" said Hagrid dubiously. ""But you mind the older'uns. Some of those kids...""

He trailed off, shaking his head. Harry thought about saying that he was sure he had more to fear from Snape than any of the students, but Hagrid was already moving on,

""Be careful, Harry. Yer both fine, but a lot of Dark Wizards did come from Slytherin.""

""But not all of them,"" Ron spoke up. ""What about Sirius Black?"" He shuddered. ""He was as Dark as they come.""

""Who's Sirius Black?"" Harry asked, but before Ron could answer Hagrid abruptly straightened up.

""Death Eater. Real bad'un, but he's safe in Azkaban. Don' you worry about that, Harry.""

Harry opened his mouth to ask why he needed to he told not to worry about Black when he was safe in Azkaban, but Hagrid had already turned to Ron. ""How's Charlie gettin' on? He ever get to go out t'Romania?""

Ron launched into an excited account of Charlie's successful application, and how much he was enjoying his work, and Harry sat back. Hagrid's reaction had been weird. Plenty of people had been telling him about Death Eaters since he had got to Hogwarts, and no one had shut down like that.

There was something going on. It didn't look like Hagrid was going to tell him, but that was fine. If nothing else, living with the Dursleys had taught Harry patience.

""That was fun.""

Harry smiled. Hagrid hadn't said another word about Death Eaters, but the visit had been fun despite that. He and Ron had got on well, and while Hagrid hadn't exactly seemed pleased about their sorting he wasn't against it. It was about as good as Harry could have hoped for.

Neither of them had been able to manage Hagrid's rock cakes though, and both their stomachs were rumbling as they made their way into the Entrance Hall. Harry saw the rest of the first-year Slytherins filing into the Great Hall up ahead, but just as he and Ron made to follow them a voice echoed through the hall.

""Ron.""

Ron froze. Harry glanced round and one of the twins came running up. He shot quick look at Ron, but though his friend paled, he managed a nod of greeting.

""George. You all right?""

George nodded. He was quiet for a moment as he looked Ron over, but just as Ron was starting to shift from foot to foot George cleared his throat. ""Yeah. Yeah, you?""

Ron shrugged. ""Fine.""

George nodded again. Harry looked between the two of them. He didn't have siblings, and had no idea what was going on, but neither of them looked like they were having fun. George finally coughed and folded his arms.

""Anyone giving you problems?""

""You mean apart from Fred?""

George flinched, and Ron ducked his head. ""Sorry,"" he muttered, but George shook his head.

""No, it's... Yeah."" He bit his lip. ""Ron, look, I know I've been a bit of a shitty brother.""

He paused. Ron's jaw dropped before he snapped it shut. George gave a weak huff. ""Was sort of hoping for a disagreement there. I know,"" he said, when Ron started to open his mouth, ""I've been thinking. Even before all this...""

He broke off shaking his head. Ron still looked like he couldn't believe what he was hearing, but George continued before he could say anything else, ""I'm sorry. Percy was right. Don't tell him that,"" he added quickly. Ron snorted, and George managed a quick grin before his expression turned serious again. ""You're my brother. Doesn't matter what house you're in.""

Ron's blue eyes were very bright. He tried to speak, coughed, and tried again. ""That's... Thanks.""

George ruffled his hair quickly and stepped back. ""Yeah, well. It's true. I just wanted to make sure you knew.""

He started to turn away, then paused. ""And I'll get into Fred's thick head one way or another. It just...might take a while.""

He vanished into the crowd before Ron could say anything else. Ron stared after him until Harry nudged him.

""Are you okay?""

Ron sniffed. ""Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine."" He scrubbed a hand over his face, and smiled at Harry. ""Thanks, mate.""

Harry smiled back. ""Any time.""

As pleased as he was for his friend though, Harry couldn't keep his thoughts from drifting back to their chat with Hagrid. There was something he wasn't being told about Sirius Black, and Harry was going to find out what."

Just as Harry was reaching for a pack of something called Chocolate Frogs the door to their compartment slid open. The pale boy from Diagon Alley was standing in the entrance, his trunk at his feet and an Eagle owl in a cage in his hand.

""I've been kicked out of my compartment and this is the only one left with space, so I'll be joining you,"" said the boy, dragging his trunk in and storing it in one of the corners. He set his birdcage down next to Hedwig's and cleared a space next to Harry for him to sit down on.

Ron glared at the other boy and Harry looked between them, confused.

The blond boy extended his hand to Harry.

""Malfoy, Draco Malfoy,"" he introduced himself. Harry took the hand and shook it.

""Harry,"" he said. ""Er, Potter,"" he added nervously. Draco's grey eyes went wide but otherwise, his face remained the same. Ron cleared his throat and Draco glanced over at him. His eyes swept over Ron and a sneer pulled at his lips.

""No need to ask who you are. My father told me all Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.""

Harry snatched his hand from Draco's grip and the other boy turned back to him.

""You shouldn't say that, you don't even know him,"" Harry told Draco, eyes narrowed.

Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.

""I'd apologize if I were you,"" he continued, more bravely than he felt because even though Draco was their size, he was far more intimidating.

""Malfoy's don't apologize,"" he sneered. ""Especially not to filthy poor blood-traitors like Weasley.""

Ron stood up, then Draco did, and then Harry stood between them.

""You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there,"" Draco told Harry.

""I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,"" he said coolly.

Draco went pink again.

""Listen, Draco, you're stuck in here with us, right?"" asked Harry. Draco nodded slowly. ""Then you should try to be nice, at least for the rest of the trip,"" he looked behind him at Ron. ""And that means you too, Ron.""

Both boys sent each other one last nasty look before sitting back down.

""What are these?"" Harry asked Ron, holding up the pack of Chocolate Frogs he had been reaching for before Draco arrived. ""They're not really frogs are they?"" he was starting to feel nothing would surprise him. Draco scoffed.

""No,"" said Ron. ""But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.""

""What?""

""Oh, honestly Potter, don't you know anything? Chocolate Frogs have cards in them of famous Witches and Wizards,"" explained Draco, haughtily.

""Of course he wouldn't know Malfoy, he's been living with Muggles,"" snapped Ron. ""Lot's of people collect the cards. I've got about five hundred cards, but I haven't got any Agrippa or Ptolemy.""

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.

""So this is Dumbledore!"" said Harry.

""Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!"" said Ron. ""Can I have a frog? Might get Agrippa - thanks -""

Harry turned his card over and read:




ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS


Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.

""He's gone!""

""You can't expect him to hang around all day, Potter,"" Draco rolled his eyes. ""He'll be back though.""

""Oh, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.""

Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. Harry noticed Draco's eyeing the pile of sweets as well.

""Help yourselves,"" said Harry. ""But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.""

""Do they? What, they don't move at all?"" Ron sounded amazed. ""Weird!""

""Muggles are quite strange,"" commented Draco, taking a bite out of a licorice wand.

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards and Draco mostly just glanced at them before deciding whether to keep them or not, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, when Draco made a strangled noise that might have been a choked off laugh.

""I've got you!"" he said, holding up a card and passing it over.

Sure enough, a baby version of Harry was blinking up at himself with his large green eyes. His lightning scar was a brighter red against his younger self's brown skin and was only barely covered by his black fringe.

He flipped the card over and read the back:




HARRY POTTER
THE BOY WHO LIVED


Known by many as The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter is the only known survivor of the Killing Curse and is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard You-Know-Who on October 31st, 1981 when he was only a year old. Harry Potter is the son of James Potter and Lily Potter nee Evans, who were tragically killed by You-Know-Who the night he was defeated, leaving young Harry orphaned.

Harry swallowed and tried to ignore the tears pooling behind his eyes.

""Do my parents have cards?"" he asked after a moment.

""Yeah, but they're really rare,"" answered Ron.

""I've got them,"" Draco announced. Harry looked over at him and caught his eyes before Draco turned to his trunk. ""I suppose I could give them to you, if you'd like."" He pulled out a large leather book and flipped toward the back. He pulled out two cards and handed them over. Harry looked down at the proffered cards them back up at Draco.

""Thank you,"" he said, voice choked with emotion as he took the cards from Draco.

""It's no problem. I didn't want them anyway.""

""Thank you,"" he stressed, clutching the cards to his chest. This gave Draco pause and his disinterested mask slipped for a second. He smiled hesitantly at Harry, who smiled in gratitude back.

Harry looked down at his new cards and studied his parents' faces eagerly.

His mother was a kind looking redhead with the same startlingly green eyes that he saw in the mirror, though her pale, slightly freckled skin appeared a more natural pair to the color, unlike his own brown skin. Her hair just brushed her shoulders and as he watched she tucked a strand behind her ear. She looked over toward where he was holding his father's card and smiled. Harry found himself following her gaze.

Looking at his father was like looking in a mirror. They shared the same perpetually messy black hair, the same russet skin, the same nose, even the same smile. The only difference between the two was that his father lacked his scar and had brown eyes underneath his round glasses, not green.

Harry didn't bother reading the backs of the cards, content with just seeing their faces. His mother disappeared for a moment and when she came back she was holding his one-year-old self. His father crowded in next to her soon after, the family squeezing into the small frame provided by the card. Harry smiled sadly at the picture of what could have been.

""Would you like a bean?"" Draco asked, snapping Harry away from his family. Harry realized he had been crying and swiftly wiped at his cheeks.

""Yeah, thanks,"" he said as he reached for the box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

""You want to be careful with those,"" Ron warned Harry. ""When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.""

Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully and bit into a corner.

""Bleaaargh - see? Sprouts.""

Harry, Ron, and Draco had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Draco made a game of trying to guess whether the bean was a good flavor or a bad one. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end of a funny grey one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper.

By the time the world outside the train was woods and dark green hills they had finished most of the sweets and had told a round-faced boy they hadn't seen his toad.

""Honestly, I would've chucked a toad as soon as I could, I don't know why he's trying to find his,"" said Draco.

""I would've done the same. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk,"" said Ron.

The rat was still snoozing in Ron's lap.

""He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,"" said Ron in disgust.

Ron told them about a spell he tried to turn to rat yellow, and a bushy-haired black girl came in asking about the lost toad. After Ron's spell didn't work she babbled about getting her letter and, after Harry, Ron, and Draco introduced themselves, about the books Harry was in. She left after stating her desire to be in Gryffindor or Ravenclaw and advised them to change into their robes.

""Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it,"" said Ron. He threw his wand back in his trunk. ""Stupid spell - George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.""

""What House are your brothers in?"" asked Harry.

""Gryffindor,"" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. ""Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.""

""That's the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?""

""That's not to say it's a bad House,"" said Draco. ""My whole family has been in Slytherin, except a cousin on my mother's side. I'll be in Slytherin too, most likely.""

""Yeah, but Slytherin's are evil, everyone knows that,"" said Ron. Draco regarded him with narrowed eyes.

""Merlin was a Slytherin, and everyone believes him to be one of the greatest wizards to ever live,"" he retorts. Ron goes nearly as red as his hair.

""Well, yeah, but-""

""And Gryffindor's aren't all good. Sirius Black was a Gryffindor and look what happened to him,"" said Draco.

""Who's Sirius Black?"" asked Harry. Draco and Ron stopped and looked over at him, both suddenly uncomfortable. Scabbers seemed to have woken up at the sound of the name and was quivering in Ron's lap.

""He was a Death Eater, one of You-Know-Who's lot, that killed a bunch of Muggles and was sent to Azkaban - that's wizard prison,"" explained Ron.

""They say he was the Dark Lord's closest follower,"" continued Draco.

""And he was a Gryffindor?"" asked Harry. The other two boys nodded. ""I guess neither is all everyone says they are,"" said Harry, thinking of all those books he's in. ""We'll stay friends, right? No matter what House we're in.""

""Of course,"" said Ron.

""Well... as long as it's not Hufflepuff,"" said Draco. Ron snorted a laugh in agreement.

They continued the ride in comfortable conversation. Harry asked about Ron's eldest bothers and Ron and Draco explained Quidditch to him, pausing here and there to argue over teams, and Hermoine came back to tell them to change into their robes again. This time the three boys listened. Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. Draco's and Harry's were both brand new, though Draco's did seem slightly better than Harry's, despite them getting them in the same place.

A voice echoed through the train: ""We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.""

Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. Only Draco looked unbothered, though Harry thought he must be just as nervous. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor

The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: ""Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?""

Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.

""C'mon, follow me - any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!""

Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.

""Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,"" Hagrid called over his shoulder, ""jus' round this bend here.""

There was a loud ""Oooooh!""

The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

""No more'n four to a boat!"" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Hermione joined Harry, Ron, and Draco in their boat, much to Draco and Ron's displeasure.

""Everyone in?"" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. ""Right then - FORWARD!""

And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Harry could have sworn he saw a tentacle breech the surface and wave at him, though no one else seemed to have noticed. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer the cliff on which it stood.

""Heads down!"" yelled Hagrid as the boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out on to rocks and pebbles.

""Oy, you there! Is this your toad?"" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.

""Trevor!"" Cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.

""Everyone here? You still got yer toad?""

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.

I have nothing against Hufflepuffs, though there does seem to be an anti-Hufflepuff sentiment in Hogwarts students.

 The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.

""The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,"" said Hagrid.

""Thank you Hagrid. I will take them from here.""

She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursley's house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones in Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led up to the upper floors.

They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right - the rest of the school must already be here - but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. Draco stood close to Harry's side and as Harry looked around he could see a group of mean looking students staring at them curiously, that is, except for two hulking boys that were more interested in the sweets they were eating than anything else. The small brunette girl in front sneered at Harry and Draco, though her sneer was nowhere near as good as Draco's was.

""Welcome to Hogwarts,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have class with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.

""The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House had its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points,"" Professor McGonagall's sharp eyes seemed to glance over and linger on Harry as she said the words. ""At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.

""The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few moments in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.""

 Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged noise. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.

""I shall return when we are ready for you,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""Please wait patiently.""

 She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. The dark-haired girl and her hulking lackeys walked up to Harry, Ron, and Draco.

""Malfoy, what are you doing talking to a Weasley?"" she demanded. Draco went pink.

""None of your business, Pansy,"" he grumbled. Pansy pursed her lips.

""You should know better than to associate with filth like them,"" she said, her eyes roaming down to Ron's short robes. ""Their poor might be contagious.""

Ron went red and was almost about to say something before Harry beat him.

""Draco can choose his friends for himself, thank you very much. He doesn't need you trying to control him.""

Pansy's eyes flickered over to him, ""And who are you?""

""Harry Potter.""

""Well, well, I suppose the rumors were true. The famous Harry Potter at Hogwarts! I suppose we should all bow down and give you our eternal thanks for vanquishing the Dark Lord,"" she laughed.

Harry felt the eyes of the others on his back now, and he tensed.

""Leave him alone, Pansy!"" Draco snapped.

Pansy huffed and stormed away, her lackeys following. Harry swallowed again and glanced at the people staring at him, though they all turned away when he caught their gaze. He flicked his eyes to Draco and Ron.

""How exactly do they sort us into Houses?"" he asked.

""Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking,"" answered Ron.

""Don't be daft, Weasley! They wouldn't give us a test, we don't know anything yet,"" said Draco, rolling his eyes. ""My father refused to say how they sorted us, but I am sure it involves some sort of magic.""

Ron grew red at his words, but the rest of the gathered first years stopped their terrified whispering. Soon, though, they all worked themselves back up, muttering about what the Sorting Ceremony entailed. It seemed as though none of them knew what to expect. Hermione was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which ones she might need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been so nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursley's saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He nearly flinched just at the memory. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.

 Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air - several people behind him screamed and Draco gripped his arm.

""What the - ?""

 He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: ""Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance - ""

""My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?""

A ghost wearing a ruff and tights has suddenly noticed the first years.

Nobody answered. Draco's hold on his arm got tighter.

""New students!"" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. ""About to be Sorted, I suppose?""

A few people nodded mutely.

""Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!"" said the Friar. ""My old House, you know.""

Draco snorted quietly beside him and Harry nudged him in the ribs.

""Move along now,"" said a sharp voice. ""The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.""

 Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.

""Now, form a line,"" Professor McGonagall told the first years, ""and follow me.""

Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind Ron, with Draco behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.

Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. The tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up there, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns interspersed with slightly darker shades in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, ""It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.""

""My father never told me how breathtaking the ceiling was,"" Draco whispered in awe.

It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.

Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool, she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.

Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing - noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth - and the hat began to sing:

""Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
But don't judge on what you see,
I'll eat myself if you can find
A smarter hat than me.
You can keep your bowlers black,
Your top hats sleek and tall,
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
And I can cap them all.
There's nothing hidden in your head
The Sorting Hat can't see,
So try me on and I will tell you
Where you ought to be.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave of heart,
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart;
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
If you've a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin
You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means
To achieve their ends.
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
And don't get in a flap!
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
For I'm a Thinking Cap!""

The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.

""So we've just got to try on a hat!"" Ron whispered to Harry. ""I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.""

""Your brothers make me glad I'm an only child, Weasley,"" Draco commented.

Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.

""Friends regardless of House, right?"" asked Harry, looking at his first two friends. They both nodded in agreement.

 Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.

""When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,"" she said. ""Abbott, Hannah!""

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which feel right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment's pause -

""HUFFLEPUFF!"" shouted the hat.

As soon as the words left the hat, Hannah's robes changed. The left breast pocket gained a yellow and black patch and the insides of the sleeves turned the same bright yellow.

The table second from the left cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.

And so it went. ""Bones, Susan"" became a Hufflepuff. ""Boot, Terry"" was the first Ravenclaw and he went to sit at the second table from the right, his robes turning blue inside and a blue and bronze patch appearing on his breast pocket. ""Brocklehurst, Mandy"" joined him, but ""Brown, Lavender"" became the first Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers cat-calling. Their robes were red inside and their patches had gold.

""Bulstrode, Millicent"" then became a Slytherin with green robes and a green and silver patch. Draco tensed beside him and Harry frowned at the unpleasant group at the table on the far right.

Harry was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.

""Finch-Fletchy, Justin!""

""HUFFLEPUFF!""

Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others, it took a little while to decide. ""Finnegan, Seamus,"" the sandy-haired boy next to Ron in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.

""Granger, Hermione!""

 Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.

""GRYFFINDOR!"" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?

When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR,"" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to ""McDougal, Morag.""

""Malfoy, Draco!""

Draco glanced at Harry and smiled.

""No matter what, yeah?"" he said, walking backward. Harry nodded. ""Hope I see you in Slytherin.""

Draco swaggered forward and put on the hat. After a minute the hall began to whisper. After two the teachers began giving each other strange looks. Harry felt his stomach twist into knots after the third minute when he noticed Draco clenching the wooden stool in his hands.

Finally, after nearly five minutes, the hat shouted out ""GRYFFINDOR!""

The entire Great Hall was silent. Draco stood slowly and set the hat back on the stool before slowly making his way toward the Gryffindor table. He looked nearly as pale as the ghosts and he seemed to tremble with every step. From behind him, Harry heard a man's voice say: ""Well, this is very serious, isn't it Minerva."" Harry turned and saw Dumbledore looking at Professor McGonagall with twinkling blue eyes. The Scottish professor tutted and shook her head. Harry turned back and saw that Draco had barely made it halfway to the table.

 Suddenly someone from the Gryffindor table began clapping and soon everyone joined in, even some people from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables, though the Slytherin table remained silent. Draco sped up and sat as far away from the rest of the House as possible.

 There weren't many people left now.

""Moon""..., ""Nott""..., ""Parkinson, Pansy,"" was the dark haired girl that was glaring and Draco and him earlier who was sorted into Slytherin, then a pair of twins girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil""..., then ""Perks, Sally-Anne""..., and then, at last -

""Potter, Harry!""

As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.

""Potter, did she say?""

""The Harry Potter?""

The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.

""Hmm,"" said a small voice in his ear. ""Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes - and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting... So where shall I put you?""

Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.

""Not Slytherin, eh?"" said the small voice. ""Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that - no? Well, if you're sure - better be GRYFFINDOR!""

Harry heard the hat shot the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shaking toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the twins yelled, ""We got Potter! We got Potter!"" Harry sat down across from Draco. The ghost with the ruff he'd seen earlier glided over and patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.

He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest to him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he's gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.

And now there were only four people left to be sorted. ""Thomas, Dean,"" a black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry and Draco at the Gryffindor table, sitting on Draco's left. ""Turpin, Lisa,"" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table, though it was unnecessary for as soon as the hat touched Ron's red hair it had shouted, ""GRYFFINDOR!""

Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed down into the chair on his left.

""Well done, Ron, excellent,"" said Percy Weasley pompously across Neville as ""Zabini, Blaise,"" was made a Slytherin. Draco flinched. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.

 Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.

Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.

""Welcome!"" he said. ""Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

""Thank you!""

He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.

""Is he - a bit mad?"" he asked no one in particular.

""Mad?"" said Percy Weasley airily. ""He's a genius! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?""

Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so much food on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, curries of all kinds, Tandoori chicken, naan bread, dishes he only recognized through pictures he had found on Indian cuisine at his school's library, strange soup with meatballs in it, packages that seem to be wrapped in leaves, several tofu dishes, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, chips, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some reason, peppermint humbugs.

The Dursleys rarely gave Harry enough to eat, and certainly never anything Indian. Had there ever been anything Harry had shown even the slightest of interest in eating, Dudley had always taken it, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with generous helpings of anything he found appetizing, even taking one of the leaf packages when he discovered they were filled with rice. It was all delicious. Harry reveled at the new spices that the Dursley's would have never let near their bland foods.

Draco, he noticed, had only small portions of the under-seasoned English food on his plate, though he was eyeing the strange soup and noodle dishes. Harry nudged them over toward Draco's side of the table. The blond looked up at him with wide eyes.

""Go on, help yourself,"" said Harry, nodding at the dishes. Draco hesitantly portioned them onto his plate and took a bite. He smiled widely.

""It's better than Mother makes it!"" he proclaimed. Draco quickly unloaded his unappetizing English food onto Ron, who happily accepted it, and instead piled his plate with the other strange dishes. He even took a bowl of soup.

""What is it?"" asked Harry.

""Bun bo Hue,"" he pointed to the soup. ""Com tam,"" he pointed to a rice dish. ""Goi cuon,"" he pointed to the summer rolls. ""They're Vietnamese.""

""You're Vietnamese? My primary school teacher was half-Vietnamese,"" Dean commented from Draco's left.

""Only a quarter. My mother was half but my father is English. We used to go to Great Aunt Walburga's house to celebrate Tet. Father didn't like it, so mother and I went alone. Mother wanted me to be aware of my ancestry,"" said Draco.

""Wish I could've had someone to teach me about being Indian,"" Harry said. ""Sounds like that would have been fun.""

His new housemates went silent around him, none of them really knowing how to respond to the reminder that Harry was an orphan.

The ghost in the ruff glided over to them looking rather miffed from a conversation he had just been having with Hermione and the Weasley twins.

""So - new Gryffindors! I must say there hasn't been a Sorting this exciting since Sirius Black came to Hogwarts! Dreadful thing he did to his poor friends, especially that nice Potter boy, though I must say I did have my suspicions of him right from the start. I mean, a Black in Gryffindor? Unheard of!"" the ghost looked around spotted Draco staring down at his com tam. Then his ghostly eyes flickered over to Harry and he seemed to grow impossibly paler. ""Er, well, I don't think I've introduced myself; my name is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. I do hope you're going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone this long without winning. Slytherins have got the Cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable - he's the Slytherin ghost.""

Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was sitting right next to the Parkinson girl who, Harry noted, didn't look pleased with the seating arrangements.

""How did he get covered in blood?"" asked Seamus with great interest.

""I've never asked,"" said Sir Nicholas delicately.

When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs, small doughnut-type things, a dark jelly-like dish, rice balls floating in something, something that looked a bit like peanut brittle with a lot more nuts, jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...

As Harry helped himself to the doughnut-type things and a scoop of ice cream that Draco informed him was cardamom flavored, the talk turned to their families.

""I'm half-and-half,"" said Seamus. ""Me dad's a Muggle, mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.""

The others laughed, but Draco looked uncomfortable.

""What about you, Neville?"" said Ron.

""Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,"" said Neville, ""but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me - he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned - but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Aunt Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced - all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here - they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.""

""That's terrible!"" Dean said. ""Your Great Uncle Alfie nearly killed you!""

""What about you, Dean?"" Seamus asked.

""Muggleborn. Mum and Dad were so relieved when the letter came and McGonagall made her visit. I was doing magic for a while, making my pictures move and all that, and they thought they were going insane.""

""McGonagall visited?"" asked Harry. ""She didn't come for me.""

""You're not Muggleborn, though,"" said Draco.

""Might as well been,"" said Harry. ""My aunt and uncle wouldn't even let Dudley read books with magic in them.""

Harry looked away from the looks his housemates were giving him and turned to the High Table. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore intensely, though the older wizard just smiled and nodded a few times, eating his dessert. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.

It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes - and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.

""Ouch!"" Harry clapped a hand to his head.

""What happened?"" asked Draco.

""N-nothing.""

The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look - a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.

""Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"" he asked Draco. The blond craned his neck and followed Harry's gaze.

""You mean Sev- er, Professor Snape?""

""Yeah, you know him?""

""He's my godfather. He's the Potions professor and Head of Slytherin,"" said Draco.

Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.

At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.

""Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.

""First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.""

Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.

""I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.

""Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.

""And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not which to die a very painful death.""

Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.

""He's not serious?"" he muttered to Ron.

""Must be,"" said Ron, shrugging. ""Percy might tell us why later, surely he told the Prefects.""

""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he were trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.

""Everyone pick their favorite tune,"" said Dumbledore, ""and off we go!""

And the school bellowed:

""Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
Teach us something please,
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees,
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff,
For now they're bare and full of air,
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
So teach us things worth knowing,
Bring back what we've forgot,
Just do your best, we'll do the rest,
And learn until our brains all rot.""

Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped the loudest.

""Ah, music,"" he said, wiping his eyes. ""A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!""

The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of more food than he's probably ever eaten at once. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.

A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.

""Peeves,"" Percy whispered to the first years. ""A poltergeist."" He raised his voice, ""Peeves - show yourself.""

A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.

""Do you want me to go get the Bloody Baron?""

There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.

""Oooooooh!"" he said, with an evil cackle. ""Ickle Firsties! What fun!""

He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.

""Go away Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!"" barked Percy.

Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.

""You want to watch out for Peeves,"" said Percy, as they set off again. ""The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.""

At the end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.

""Password?"" she said.

""Caput Draconis,"" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it - Neville needed a leg up - and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.

Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of the spiral staircase - they were obviously in one of the towers - they found their beds at last: four four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Dean, Neville, and Seamus found their trunks in the room one floor down, but Harry, Ron, and Draco had to keep going up until they had found theirs. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. Ron took the bed closest to the door, Harry next to him, Draco the one next to him, and they left the bed closest to the bathroom empty.

""Great food, isn't it?"" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. ""Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing through my sheets.""

Harry was going to ask Ron if he had any of the treacle tarts, but the redhead had already fallen asleep.

""Draco?"" whispered Harry, turning to address the curtains of the other bed.

He got no response, so he thought Draco had already fallen asleep.

Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him to transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin: it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully - and there was Parkinson, laughing at him as he struggled with it - then Parkinson turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold - there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.

He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke the next day he didn't remember the dream at all.

Sorry about the delay in updates! Holidays and school kept me busy, so I couldn't update as soon as I wanted!

This chapter has scenes from the second book because I felt that Harry's reaction to Howlers would be the same, even if it happened a year earlier.

I might not be able to update very soon because I have Midterms coming up, along with a lot of other work, and the next chapter will not be taken from the books.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy! Hopefully the next chapter will be ready soon,but I can't make any promises!

""There, look.""

""Where?""

""Next to the tall kid with the red hair.""

""Wearing the glasses?""

""Isn't that Draco Malfoy with him?""

""Did you see his face?""

""Did you see his scar?""

Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.

There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid wall just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.

The ghosts didn't help either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick, as he was apparently sometimes called, was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with pits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, ""GOT YOUR CONK!""

Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry, Ron, and Draco managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.

Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of here, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.

And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.

They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouse behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.

Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff-room fire and got up the next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.

Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he got to Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.

Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.

""Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,"" she said. ""Anyone messing around in my class will have to leave and not come back. You have been warned.""

Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, was given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that is was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.

Harry was very relieved to find that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron and Draco didn't have much of a head start.

Friday was an important day for the three Gryffindor boys. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.

""What have we got today?"" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.

""Double Potions with the Slytherins,"" said Ron. Draco winced and ducked his head.

""Professor Snape is Head of Slytherin House. He tends to favor his House and hates Gryffindor,"" said Draco. He looked over and caught Harry's eye. ""You did the reading like I told you, right?""

""You were there when I did it, Draco.""

Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly stemmed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.

Hedwig hasn't brought Harry anything yet. She sometimes flew in to nibble on his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:

Dear Harry,
I know you get Friday afternoons off, so should you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.
Hagrid

Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.

Harry turned back to his friends with a smile, only to find Draco staring up toward the ceiling. Harry turned to look where Draco's gaze was directed and saw a large Eagle Owl flying overhead. It dropped a red envelope on the plate in front of Draco and flew back out the window with barely a pause.

Draco stared down at the letter and swallowed heavily. Ron was looking at it as though he expected it to explode.

""What's that?"" asked Harry.

""That's a Howler,"" said Ron faintly.

""What's a Howler?"" Harry asked, without answer.

Harry and Ron watched as Draco hesitantly reached for the slightly smoking envelope. His hands shook as he fumbled with the opening, and the longer it took for him to open it, the more it smoked. Ron shoved his fingers into his ears the moment Draco ripped open the envelope, and Harry understood why a split second later. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.

""-DARE YOU CALL YOURSELF OUR SON? YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A DISGRACE! HOW COULD YOU SULLY THE MALFOY NAME IN SUCH A WAY-""

What one could only assume was Mr. Malfoy's voice yelled, a hundred times louder than what should be possible. It made the plates and spoons rattle on the tables and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, though it seemed obvious from the message being broadcast to the whole school. Draco steadily grew pinker and pinker as the message went on.

""-ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL! AND TO THINK I HAD TO LEARN OF YOUR BETRAYAL FROM NOTT! THE EMBARRASSMENT YOU HAVE CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND I WITH THIS FOOLISHNESS! YOUR POOR MOTHER HAS LOCKED HERSELF AWAY IN SHAME! SHE BELIEVES YOUR ABHORRENT BEHAVIOR IS HER FAULT AND NOT ENTIRELY YOUR DOING! YOU WILL CONVINCE DUMBLEDORE TO PUT YOU IN SLYTHERIN WHERE YOU BELONG! I WILL NOT TOLERATE A GRYFFINDOR AS A SON!""

A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Draco's hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. Draco stared down at the small pile of ash. A few laughs carried over from the Slytherin table, steadily growing louder.

Harry stood and turned toward the green table. Ron stood beside him and they took a step forward, only to stumble back. Draco's hands gripped their sleeves tightly.

""Don't.""

Harry and Ron sat back down slowly, though they kept throwing dirty looks over their shoulders at the Slytherins.

It was lucky Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. Other than his parents being murdered, of course.

At the start of term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry - he hated him.

Potions lessons took place down one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started class by taking roll. He sneered when he called Draco's name and, like Flitwick, paused at Harry's name.

""Ah, yes,"" he said softly, ""Harry Potter. Our new - celebrity.""

Parkinson and her friend Crabbe and Goyle, as Draco informed him, sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.

""You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making,"" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word - like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without any effort. ""As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as big a batch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.""

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows and when Harry glanced at Draco the pale boy smirked and rolled his eyes. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.

""Potter!"" said Snape suddenly. ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""

Powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? Harry glanced at Draco, who raised his eyebrows and nodded at him; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.

""Er, is it the Draught of Living Death, sir?"" said Harry.

Snape's lips pursed. Hermione's hand sank back to her desk.

""Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?""

Hermione's hand rocketed back into the air, stretched as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry knew what a bezoar was. He remembered Draco explaining it to him last night as they studied.

""A goat's stomach, sir.""

Snape frowned further and his eyes narrowed. Hermione huffed as she lowered her hand again.

""What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?""

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretched toward the dungeon ceiling.

""There isn't one, sir,"" Harry said confidently. ""It's the same plant, sir, which I'm sure Hermione could have told you if you had tried her.""

A few laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.

""Sit down,"" he snapped at Hermione. ""For your information, Potter, you are correct. Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are indeed the same plant, which also goes by the name aconite. Well, why aren't you all copying that down?""

There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, ""And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.""

Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Zabini, whom he seemed to like. Draco frowned down into the potion he and Harry were brewing, which was ignored by Snape despite the textbook perfect way it was being brewed. Harry was taking the cauldron off the fire when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.

""Idiot boy!"" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. ""I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?""

Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.

""Take him up to the hospital wing,"" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Draco, who had been working next to Neville.

""You - Potter - why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.""

This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him from where he was standing behind him at his and Dean's cauldron.

""Don't push it,"" he muttered, ""I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.""

""And you,"" Snape snapped, turning toward Draco, ""I would've thought a Malfoy would know better. But then, what should I have expected from a blood-traitor like yourself? No better than that filthy cousin of yours. Another point from Gryffindor.""

Draco remained silent, though his jaw was tight and his hands were curled into white-knuckled fists.

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon gown an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week - why did Snape hate him so much? Who exactly was Draco's cousin?

""Cheer up,"" said Ron, ""Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?""

""Yeah, all right. Draco, do you want to come with?""

Draco curled his lips at the mention of the large man, some prejudice left over from his family. He was opening his mouth to refuse when a group of laughing first year Slytherins bumped into them. His shoulders deflated and the sneer fell off his face. He sighed and nodded his head.

At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.

When Harry knocked on the door they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks that made Draco jump. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, ""Back, Fang - back.""

Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.

""Hold on,"" he said. ""Back, Fang.""

He let them in, struggling to keep hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.

There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.

""Make yerselves at home,"" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears while Draco looked on in disgust. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.

""This is Ron,"" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.

""Another Weasley, eh?,"" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. ""I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest.""

""And this is Draco,"" Harry continued, looking over at the blonde boy.

""Lucius Malfoy's son?"" asked Hagrid, frowning. Draco jutted his chin forward.

""Not anymore. Lucius Malfoy won't have a Gryffindor as a son,"" he muttered. Hagrid's face softened.

""Oh, it'll be alright! 'Specially with Harry an' Ron here with yeh! Why, Siri-"" Hagrid cut himself off and his face clouded over. ""Well, it's happened before, an' they got through it with their friends, so don't yeh worry!"" he said as he offered them the plate of rock cakes.

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but the boys pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.

The trio of boys were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch ""that old git.""

""An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.""

Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.

""But he seems to really hate me.""

""Rubbish!"" said Hagrid. ""Why would he?""

Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.

""How's yer brother Charlie?"" Hagrid asked Ron. ""I liked him a lot - great with animals.""

Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While the others discussed Ron's brother's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:





GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST



Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied that same day.
""But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,"" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.

Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.

""Hagrid!"" said Harry, ""that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!""

There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, tracking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?

As Harry, Ron, and Draco walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?

Oh my God I am so sorry. I know I said it would be a while between updates but I swear I had no idea it would take so long.

Midterms kicked my ass so I couldn't really write. Then I had to write all of this off the top of my head, which always means it takes me forever. On top of that for some reason, this scene just didn't want to go the way I wanted so I've had to rewrite it about fifty thousand times and even then I'm not super happy about it. And finally, I had a shit ton of projects given to me by my teachers ON TOP OF having to do work on my Graduation Project, which if I don't do well on it I won't be able to graduate.

So I'm really sorry about how long it's taken to get this chapter out. Also sorry it's so short.

Harry was still awake long after the rest of the castle had fallen asleep that night. His mind couldn't seem to stop working. He thought about his classes, and Professor Snape, and the break-in at Gringotts, and Draco Malfoy. At that moment, Draco Malfoy was the most pressing thought in his mind. Perhaps it was because he could hear the sounds of someone muffling their tears from his bed. He turned onto his side so he was facing Draco's bed. Both of their curtains were open and Harry could almost make out a fuzzy lump on his bed that might have been the pale-haired boy.

""Draco? Are you awake?"" Harry whispered. He wasn't sure if the other boy could hear him over the sounds of Ron's snores.

""What?"" hissed Draco. His voice was congested with the tears he had been shedding.

Harry didn't really know what to say. He hadn't thought this far ahead.

""Did you want something Harry?"" asked Draco, his voice still soft so he wouldn't wake up Ron. Harry thought they could shout at the tops of their lungs and not wake up Ron.

""No. Er, not really. I just couldn't sleep,"" Harry explained weakly. He watched Draco's still form and berated himself for bothering his friend. He turned away from Draco and stared instead at Ron's bed, though the view wasn't that interesting due to Ron's closed curtains.

Someone crawled onto his bed and Harry jumped in surprise before he realized it was Draco. It was hard to see him in the dark, but his nearly white hair practically shone in the dim light of the waxing crescent moon.

Harry shifted over and sat up, reaching blindly for his glasses on his bedside table. He slid them on and the few things he could see focused. Draco reached over and closed the curtain between them and Ron, then tugged the one on the other side closed as well. Harry's bed was shrouded in darkness immediately.

""Lumos,"" Draco whispered and the tip of his wand lit up with blue light. Harry hadn't even realized he brought his wand with him.

""Professor Quirrell hasn't taught us that spell yet,"" he said.

""I was raised with magic, Harry. My parents made sure I knew something before they sent me off.""

Harry said nothing in response, simply stared at Draco in the wand's pale light. The whites of his eyes were rimmed with red and slightly puffy. Harry didn't comment on it.

""Well?"" Draco asked, one brow raised. Harry looked down and then at Draco's wand.

""What was it like being raised by wizards?"" Harry asked. Draco looked away and the light on his wand wavered slightly.

""I suppose it was fairly normal,"" Draco shrugged. ""What was it like being raised by Muggles?""

Harry thought of his cupboard. He thought of the Dursley's calling him a freak. He thought of Dudley's old clothes. He thought of the neighbors that sneered at him or praised the Dursley's for taking in the 'poor little orphan' despite his brown skin.

""Fairly normal.""

The two boys sat in silence, contemplating the lies they just told each other. Neither called the other out on them, of course.

""Why'd it take so long for you to be Sorted?"" Harry asked after a few minutes of silence.

""Why did you take so long?"" Draco asked back.

""I asked you first,"" said Harry. Draco frowned at him.

""I'll answer if you do,"" he finally decided.

""Alright. You first.""

Draco sighed and looked away.

""It's called a Hat Stall, when the Hat takes a while like that. It happens when the Hat can't decide where to put you, when it's stuck between two options,"" Draco looked down and fiddled with his wand, the light flickering slightly. ""The Hat knew exactly where to put me as soon as I put it on.""

""Did it want to put you in Slytherin?"" Harry asked. Draco's head snapped up and he glared at him.

""No. And don't interrupt,"" he snapped. ""The Hat wanted to put me in Gryffindor. But I argued against it. I told it I was a Slytherin, through and through, but the Hat didn't listen to me. It said 'my true heart belonged in Gryffindor',"" Draco sneered at the words and shrugged. ""That's all. Now, what about you?""

Harry chewed on his lip in thought, deciding how to explain his experience with the Hat.

""Well, uhm, the Hat wasn't sure where to put me at first, then it said I would do well in Slytherin,"" he shrugs. ""I chose Gryffindor.""

""Of course you did,"" Draco sneered. Harry frowned at him and crossed his arms in front of him.

""What's that supposed to mean?"" he demands.

""Perfect Potter, the Boy Who Lived, of course, he would choose to be in Gryffindor with all the other brave little heroes,"" Draco scoffed with derision.

""You're in Gryffindor too, you know!"" Harry pointed out, keeping his voice low. ""And it's not like I knew about all this when I was choosing, I didn't have some grand pureblood upbringing like you or Ron! Maybe I just wanted to be in the same House as my friend!""

Draco stared at him with wide grey eyes and the light from his wand flickered slightly.

""I keep forgetting you were raised by Muggles,"" Draco spit the word from his mouth like poison.

""Wish I could do the same,"" Harry mumbled to himself. The two boys sat in silence for a brief moment, surrounded by the blue glow from Draco's wand.

""Do you miss them?"" Draco asked. ""Your parents, I mean.""

""Dunno. I never really knew them,"" he shrugged.

""Do you remember anything about them?""

Harry remembered a green light and a women's scream.

""No.""

Harry picked up his pillow and hugged it to his chest. Draco's eyes found the three cards resting on the bed where the pillow was. Harry followed his gaze and flushed, picking up the cards. The light showed the sleeping faces of James and Lily in their separate cards, baby Harry's tiny face slack and drooling in sleep resting in the crook of his mother's arms.

""I'm sorry you never got to know them,"" Draco whispered.

""Thanks,"" Harry whispered back. They both ignored the tears gathered in Harry's eyes.

""You know, a lot of the professors have been here for a really long time,"" Draco started, ""I'm sure some of them remember your parents. You could ask them about them. If you wanted to, of course.""

Harry looked up in surprise and smiled at Draco.

""You think?""

Draco shrugged, ""I don't see why they wouldn't.""

Harry launched himself at Draco and hugged him tightly. The blond tensed and held himself still as Harry wrapped him in his arms.

""Thank you,"" Harry whispered.

""Er, it was no trouble, Harry. I, erm, suppose we should go back to bed, then,"" Draco carefully removed himself from Harry's embrace. He whispered 'nox' and the light at the end of his wand went out.

""G'night then, Draco,"" Harry yawned, realizing only then just how tired he was.

""Goodnight, Harry,"" Draco whispered back.

Harry set his glasses back on his nightstand and put his pillow back, the cards with his family on them underneath, and finally went to sleep.

Perhaps it was due to his conversation with Draco, but that night Harry dreamt about the Dursleys.

He was back in his cupboard under the stairs and he could hear Uncle Vernon and Dudley in the living room watching telly. There was a knock on the door and Uncle Vernon called for him to open it, but Harry found himself unable to move. Aunt Petunia's heels clicked on the floor as she went to answer it. Harry watched through the open grate in his door, his vision limited though it was, as she opened the door.

There was a high, cold laugh and then a flash of green light. As Aunt Petunia crumpled to the ground, her tight black bun fell into shoulder length red hair, and a scream died before it left her throat. A dark figure glided down the hallway and passed his door. Harry looked out and saw Professor Snape, though he was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban. Snape turned toward the living room, but the next thing Harry knew his door was wrenched open and a wand was being pointed at him. It was as white as a bone and filled Harry with fear. When he looked into the living room it wasn't Vernon and Dudley he saw, but Ron and Draco. He looked by the door where his Aunt lay, but found his mother and father there instead. His head looked wildly about and found Hermione on the stairs, Dean and Seamus on the other end of the hallway, Fred and George by the kitchen door. He turned back to Snape and found the Bloody Baron grinning back at him. It turned Harry's stomach. The Baron lifted the bone white wand and pointed at him. There was a flash of green light and -

Harry woke up gasping for breath, sweat dripping down his forehead. His scar ached slightly and he winced as he put his hand to it. He blearily rubbed his eyes and turned over, closing his eyes and hoping for more sleep.

He fell back to sleep moments later and when he woke the next day the nightmare was only a faint memory.

Harry had never believed he would meet someone he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Pansy Parkinson. Still, the first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Parkinson much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday - and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.

""Typical,"" said Harry darkly. ""Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Parkinson.""

He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.

""You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,"" said Ron reasonably.

""Doesn't matter anyway,"" interjected Draco, ""Pansy's a rubbish flyer. Blaise is alright though, I've played Quidditch with him a few times at home. Not as good as he's been saying,"" Draco rolls his eyes and shrugs, ""but he's still good.""

It seemed as if flying was all the first year pure- and half-blood students could talk about, each of them bragging about how good they were at flying. The way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Draco had a tendency to spout long rambling narratives about how he would race around the Malfoy Manor and its grounds, though each of them seemed to end with his narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters, so Harry learned to take his stories with a grain of salt. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he's almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from Wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas about football. Ron couldn't see what was so exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. That wasn't to mention the week that Ron and Draco wouldn't talk to each other after they insulted the other's favorite Quidditch team.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.

Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book - not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday, she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.

Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Parkinson had been quick to notice, of course. Parkinson's owl was always bringing her packages of sweets from home, which she opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. Draco continued to receive Howlers from his father and the occasional letter from his mother. He was quick to destroy the Howlers before they could erupt, but he always saved the letters from his mother, which Harry often found him reading in their dormitory later.

A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.

""It's a Remembrall!"" he explained. ""Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red - oh..."" His face fell because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, ""... you've forgotten something...""

Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten, scratching at his bare head and ruffling his fine blond hair, when Pansy Parkinson, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet, though Draco just dropped his head and stayed seated. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Parkinson, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.

""What's going on?""

""Parkinson's got my Remembrall, Professor.""

Scowling, Parkinson quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.

""Just looking,"" she said, and she slipped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind her.

""Longbottom, I suggest you go put your hat on before classes start,"" McGonagall commented before she walked away. Neville's hands went to his blond head, which was indeed bare of his pointed wizard's hat before he leapt from the table and dashed off toward the doors.



At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, Draco, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns towards a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.

The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always few slightly to the left.

Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.

""Well, what are you all waiting for?"" she barked. ""Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.""

Harry glanced down at his broomstick. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.

""Stick out your right hand over your broom,"" called Madam Hooch at the front, ""and say 'Up!'""

""UP!"" everyone shouted.

Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.

Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron giggled when Draco flushed after she told him he'd been doing it wrong for years. Their friend glared at them, but they all knew it was all in good fun. What really amused the trio was when Parkinson tipped over sideways and fell off her broom.

""Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,"" said Madam Hooch. ""Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two -""

But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.

""Come back, boy!"" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle - twelve feet - twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -

WHAM - a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.

Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.

""Broken wrist,"" Harry heard her mutter. ""Come one, boy - it's all right, up you get.""

She turned to the rest of the class.

""None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.""

Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.

No sooner were they out of earshot than Parkinson burst into laughter.

""Did you see that great lump's face?""

The other Slytherins joined in.

""Shut up, Parkinson,"" snapped Parvati Patil.

""Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?"" said Parkinson. ""Never thought you'd like fat little cry-babies, Parvati.""

""Look!"" said Blaise Zabini, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. ""It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.""

The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.

""Give it here, Zabini,"" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.

Zabini and Parkinson looked at each other, then both smiled nastily.

""I think Blaise should leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find,"" she said.

""Like up a tree,"" Zabini finished.

""Give it here!"" Harry yelled, but Zabini had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. Draco hadn't been lying when he said Blaise could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, ""Come and get it, Potter!""

Harry grabbed his broom.

""No!"" shouted Hermione Granger. ""Madam Hooch told us not to move - you'll get us all into trouble.""

Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him - and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he found something he could do without being taught - this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron and Draco.

He turned his broomstick sharply to face Zabini in midair. Zabini looked stunned.

""Give it here,"" Harry called, ""or I'll knock you off that broom!""

""Oh, yeah?"" said Zabini, trying to sneer but looking worried.

Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot forward toward Zabini like a javelin. Zabini only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.

""No Slytherins up here to save your neck, Zabini,"" Harry called.

The same thought seemed to have struck Zabini.

""Catch it if you can, then!"" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.

Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down - next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball - wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching - he stretched out his hand - a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.

""HARRY POTTER!""

His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.

""Never - in all my time at Hogwarts -""

Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ""- how dare you - might have broken your neck -""

""It wasn't his fault, Professor -""

""Be quiet, Miss Patil -""

""Blaise started -""

""Not now, Mr. Malfoy -""

""But Zabini -""

""That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.""

Harry caught sight of Parkinson, Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. Draco was still railing against Pansy and Blaise as he walked away, which made him feel a warm gratitude toward his friend but didn't stop the sinking in his stomach. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? What would Vernon do when he came back early?

Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still, Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stomped around on the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.

Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.

""Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?""

Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?

But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused.

""Follow me, you two,"" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.

""In here.""

Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.

""Out, Peeves!"" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.

""Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood - I've found you a Seeker.""

Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.

""Are you serious, Professor?""

""Absolutely,"" said Professor McGonagall crisply. ""The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. What that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?""

Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.

""He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,"" Professor McGonagall told Wood. ""Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.""

Wood was now looking as if all his dreams had come true at once.

""Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?"" he asked excitedly.

""Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,"" Professor McGonagall explained.

""He's just the build for a Seeker, too,"" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. ""Light - speedy - we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.""

""I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks....""

Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses as Harry.

""I want to hear you're training hard, Potter or I may change my mind about punishing you.""

Then she suddenly smiled.

""Your father would have been proud,"" she said. ""He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.""



""You're joking.""

It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron and Draco what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it. Draco had very nearly spit out his canh chua when Harry told them he had been made Seeker and was now staring at him with his mouth hanging open.

""Seeker?"" he said. ""But first years never - must be the youngest House player in about -""

""- a century,"" said Harry, shoveling aloo matar into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ""Wood told me.""

Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.

""When do you start training?"" asked Draco, leaned forward across the table.

""Next week,"" answered Harry. ""Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.""

Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.

""Well done,"" said George in a low voice. ""Wood told us. We're on the team too - Beaters.""

""I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year,"" said Fred. ""We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.""

""Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new passageway out of the school.""

""Bet it's the one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week.""

""Or the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we found after we got the map,"" George added as the twins left.

Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Parkinson and Zabini, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

""Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?"" Zabini asked, a practiced sneer on his face.

""You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,"" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.

""He could take you on anytime on his own,"" said Parkinson. ""But I'd rather do it myself. Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only - no contact. What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?""

Ron bristled beside Harry, no doubt ready to come to his defense, but this time Draco beat him to it.

""Don't be ridiculous, Pansy, of course, I've taught him about wizard's duels. I'm his second, who's yours?""

Parkinson looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. Evidently finding them wanting she turned to Zabini.

""Blaise,"" she said. ""Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked.""

When Parkinson was gone, Ron and Harry looked at Draco.

""What is a wizard's duel?"" said Harry. ""And what do you mean, you're my second?""

""I'm there in case you die,"" said Draco casually, starting in on his cold canh chua again.

""What are you thinking Malfoy!"" Ron demanded. Draco looked up and caught the look on Harry's face.

""Oh, not to worry though, Harry, nothing will happen. Only proper wizards ever die in duels, anyone younger than a fourth year doesn't know any spells that can do a lot of damage. The most you and Parkinson will do is throw a few sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough to do any harm. She probably expected you to refuse, anyway."" Draco tried to reassure him.

""And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?""

""Throw it away and punch her in the face,"" Ron suggested.

""Excuse me.""

They all looked up. It was Hermoine Granger.

""Can't a person eat in peace in this place?"" said Ron.

Hermoine ignored him and spoke to Harry.

""I couldn't help overhearing what you and Parkinson were saying -""

""Bet you could,"" Ron muttered. Draco scoffed.

""- and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's really very selfish of you.""

""And it's really none of your business,"" said Harry.

""Goodbye,"" said Ron. Draco smiled and waved at her dismissively.



All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay in one of the large, over-stuffed chairs in the common room listening to Dean and Seamus bickering over the merits of Quidditch versus football, as well as commenting on the excitement of the flying lesson (Neville still wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron and Draco were still nattering on about the different spells he could use, and had repeatedly given him advice such as 'If she tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it because I can't remember how to block them.' There was a very good chance that they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt that he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. Although, he thought, if he did die in the duel at least he wouldn't have to go back to the Dursleys.

Percy finally sent them all to bed, but Harry couldn't find it in himself to actually sleep, too strung up with nerves to even consider closing his eyes. Even still, Parkinson's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Parkinson face-to-face. He couldn't miss it

""Half-past eleven,"" Draco muttered at last, ""we'd better go.""

They pulled on their bathrobes and picked up their wands, lingering for a half-second in the tower room. Ron had passed out at some point, and they weren't sure whether they should wake him or not. While there was a good chance that Parkinson would bring Crabbe and Goyle along with Zabini, it would also be easier to sneak out of the tower with only two people, instead of three. The two looked at each other and came to a silent agreement to let Ron sleep. They crept down the spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor common room. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, ""I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry.""

A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.

""Granger!"" whispered Draco furiously. ""Go back to bed!""

""I almost told Ron's brother,"" Hermione snapped, ""Percy - he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this.""

Harry couldn't believe someone could be so interfering.

""Come on,"" he said to Draco. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.

Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Draco through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.

""Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.""

""Go away.""

""All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so -""

But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing the empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.

""Now what am I going to do?"" she asked shrilly.

""I suppose that's your problem,"" said Draco. ""We've got somewhere to be, and we're going to be late.""

They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.

""I'm coming with you,"" she said.

""You are most certainly not.""

""D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.""

""The nerve -""

""Shut up, both of you!"" said Harry sharply. ""I heard something.""

It was a sort of snuffling.

""Do you think it's Mrs. Norris?"" inquired Draco, scarcely breathing and squinting through the dark.

It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.

""Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get into bed.""

""Keep quiet!"" hissed Draco, casting furtive glances down the hallway.

""The new password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.""

""How's your arm?"" said Harry.

""Fine,"" said Neville, showing them. ""Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.""

""Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later -""

""Don't leave me!"" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, ""I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already.""

Draco huffed and threw his hands up, turning and walking back down the corridor. He stopped about halfway and turned back to them, glaring and pointing at Hermione and Neville.

""You can come with, but if either of you gets us caught I'll hex you both so hard your great grandchildren will feel it,"" said Draco.

Hermione huffed and opened her mouth to protest, but stopped herself when they all heard the sound of the portrait hole creaking open.

""Harry? Draco? Are you out there?""

The group turned together and watched as Ron climbed out of the Gryffindor entrance.

""HOLD THE DOOR!"" they all shouted as one, but it was too late. The portrait swung closed before Ron could realize what they were saying.

""Great going Weasley, now there's even more of us to get caught by Filch,"" Draco said.

Ron opened his mouth, perhaps to tell Draco off, but Harry hissed at him to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.

They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn, Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.

Parkinson and Zabini weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the dots at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Parkinson leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.

""She's late, maybe she's chickened out,"" Ron whispered. Draco sucked in a sharp breath.

""Or she's set us up!"" Draco whispered back.

A noise came from the other room and made them jump. Harry only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak - and it wasn't Parkinson.

""Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.""

It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris.

""Run,"" whispered Draco then grabbed Harry's hand and waved madly at the others to follow them as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped around the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.

""They're in here somewhere,"" they heard him mutter, ""probably hiding.""

""This way!"" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run - he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled into a suit of armor.

The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.

""RUN!"" Harry yelled, and the five of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following - they swung around the rooftops and scalloped down one corridor then another, Harry and Draco in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going - they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near the Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.

""I think we lost him,"" Harry painted, leaning the cold wall and wiping his forehead with one hand. It was then he realized he and Draco were still holding hands. The two boys blushed, dropped each other's hand, and looked away from the other. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.

""I - told - you,"" Hermoine gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, ""I - told - you.""

""Yes, thank you, Hermione,"" said Draco, rolling his eyes.

""We've got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,"" said Ron, ""quickly as possible.""

""Parkinson tricked you,"" Hermione said to Harry. ""You realize that don't you? She was never going to meet you - Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Parkinson must have tipped him off.""

""I think we managed to work that out for ourselves, thanks,"" said Draco.

""Let's go,"" said Harry, sighing.

It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.

It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.

""Shut up, Peeves - please - you'll get us thrown out,"" Harry begged.

Peeves cackled.

""Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty!""

""Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please,"" Harry tried again.

""Should tell Filch, I should,"" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but with his eyes glittering wickedly. ""It's for your own good, you know.""

Draco put out his arm to stop Ron, who looked one second away from trying to fight Peeves, and stepped forward.

""But Peeves, if you tell Filch, that'll make him happy. You don't want to make Filch happy, do you?""

Peeves paused and pondered this for a bit.

""Suppose I don't, Ickle Blood-traitor. But what will the Ickle Firsties do for Peevsie? Not as clever as the last ones, but more of you. Used to be four but now there's more!"" Peeves descended into giggles at that.

""I've had enough of this. Get out of the way!"" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves - this was a big mistake.

""STUDENTS OUT OF BED!"" Peeves bellowed, ""STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!""

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor when they slammed into a door - and it was locked.

""This is it,"" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, ""We're done for! This is the end!""

They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could towards Peeves' shouts.

""Oh, move over,"" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, ""Alohomora!""

The lock clicked and the door swung open - they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.

""Which way did they go, Peeves?"" Filch was saying. ""Quick, tell me.""

""Say 'please'.""

""Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?""

""Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,"" said Peeves in his annoying dungeon voice.

""All right - please.""

""NOTHING! Haha! Haaaaaa!"" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.

""He thinks this door is locked,"" Harry whispered. ""I think we'll be okay - get off, Neville!"" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. ""What?""

Harry turned around - and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare - this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.

They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.

They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between the ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.

It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.

Harry groped for the doorknob - between Filch and death, he'd take Filch - only to find another hand already on it. He turned and caught Draco's eye, who nodded.

""On three, get ready to run. One. Two. Three!""

They fell backward - Draco slammed the door shut and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared - all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor, who was luckily back in her portrait.

""Where on earth have you all been?"" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.

""Never mind that - pig snout, pig snout,"" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward - though not without the Fat Lady grumbling to herself about young Gryffindors and their fathers. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.

It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.

""What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?"" said Ron finally. ""If any dog needs exercise, that one does.""

Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.

""You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?"" she snapped. ""Didn't you see what it was standing on?

""The floor?"" Harry suggested. ""I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.""

""No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.""

She stood up, glaring at them.

""I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could have all been killed - or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.""

Ron stared after her, his mouth open.

""She needs the sort out her priorities,"" he said.

""Honestly, you'd think we dragged her along,"" Draco mumbled.

But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide - except perhaps Hogwarts.

It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.

Sorry for not updating sooner! A friend of mine borrowed my Harry Potter books before going off to college and she only just came back for winter break to give them to me, so I couldn't update for a while.

Parkinson couldn't believe her eyes when she saw that Harry and Draco were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry, Draco, and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled his two friends in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.

""It's either really valuable or really dangerous,"" said Ron.

""Or both,"" said Harry.

""Probably both,"" said Draco.

But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much of a chance of guessing what it was without further clues.

Neither Neville not Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.

Hermione was now refusing to speak to the three boys, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Parkinson and Blaise, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.

As the owls flooded into the Great Hall, as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.

Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky because it said:



DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand,
but I don't want everybody knowing you've got
a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood
will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at
seven o'clock for your first training session.


Professor M. McGonagall


Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note across the table for Ron and Draco to read.

""A Nimbus Two Thousand!"" Ron moaned enviously. ""I've never even touched one.""

""Well, of course, you haven't,"" Draco scoffed, ""I'm getting one next year, if they haven't come out with a new one, father promis-""

Draco trailed off, accompanied by a look of dawning horror.

""Draco?"" asked Harry.

Draco bolted from his seat at the table and rushed to the door. Harry and Ron both sprung up to follow, Ron grabbing the broomstick on his way. They were halfway across the entrance hall when they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Parkinson seized the package from Ron and passed it to Zabini, who felt it and smirked.

""That's a broomstick,"" he said, throwing it back to them with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.

""Yeah,"" Harry snapped, craning his neck around Crabbe and Goyle's lumbering forms.

""Think that because you're the Boy Who Lived you get special privileges, Potter? First years can't have brooms, you know,"" said Parkinson.

Ron couldn't resist it.

""It's not any old broomstick,"" he said, ""it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Zabini, a Cleansweep Seven?"" Ron grinned at Harry. ""Cleansweeps are good, but no match for the Nimbus.""

""What would you know about it, Weasley? You couldn't raise enough money to even touch one,"" Zabini snapped back.

""Your little family of blood-traitors and muggle-lovers probably have to save up twig by twig,"" Parkinson sneered.

Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Parkinson's elbow.

""Not arguing I hope?"" he squeaked.

""Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,"" said Parkinson quickly.

""Yes, yes, that's right,"" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. ""Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?""

""A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,"" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Parkinson and Zabini's faces. ""And it's really thanks to Zabini here that I've got it,"" he added. ""If you'll excuse us, Professor, we really need to get back to our dorms.""

Harry and Ron headed upstairs, Ron smothering his laughter at the Slytherin duo's obvious rage and confusion. Harry just wished he could enjoy it more, but he was worried about Draco.

""I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking the rules, then?"" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.

""I really don't have time for this, Hermione,"" groaned Harry.

""Weren't you not speaking to us? Don't stop now, it's doing us so much good,"" said Ron.

Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.

""Come on, we've got to get to Draco,"" said Harry, walking steadily back to the dorms.

Draco wasn't in the common room, nor was he in their dormitory when Harry went up to stash his Nimbus under his bed. The fifth-year studying in the common room said she hadn't seen him since they left for breakfast, and by then they didn't have time to keep looking, or they'd be late for double Potions.

Draco was, of course, waiting for them in Snape's classroom when they arrived. Though his eyes seemed a little redder than normal, he showed no signs that this morning was anything other than normal.

Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. Occasionally it would take a quick jaunt to wonder why Draco had suddenly left that morning and where he'd gone. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then grabbed Draco and Ron to rush upstairs and unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.

""Wow,"" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread. Draco watched it with keen eyes, though he remained quiet and refused to meet either Ron or Harry's eyes.

Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.

Harry glanced from Draco, who had settled on his bed with his History of Magic textbook, to the clock, which showed that he had fifteen minutes to get to the Quidditch field. He bit his lip and glanced at Draco again before snatching up his broom and running out of the dorm. He drew more than a few looks as he ran out of the castle with his Nimbus clutched in his fist, though by now he was used to people looking at him all the time.

He'd never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except they were fifty feet high.

Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.

""Hey, Potter, come down!""

Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.

""Very nice,"" said Wood, his eyes glinting. ""I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.""

After Wood explained to him about Chasers, Keepers, Quaffles, Bludgers, Beaters, Seekers, and the Golden Snitch, and after they had practiced with golf balls until it got too dark, Harry helped Wood pack up.

""Um, Wood?"" Harry asked, squinting at his shoes in the dark.

""Something wrong?"" Wood replied.

""Not really, it's just that I was wondering what happened to your other Seeker? I mean, you must've held tryouts since your last Seeker graduated, and I was thinking that it can't be very fair to whoever tried out for the spot, me getting it like I did. Then I started wondering if me getting the spot had to do with me being, well, Harry Potter, and not being the best person for the spot. Especially since I've never even been on a broom until yesterday,"" Harry shrugged and gripped his broom tightly. Wood rested his hand on Harry's shoulder firmly, if a bit awkwardly.

""Harry, I didn't have a new Seeker yet. We held tryouts, yeah, but none of them could perform like I needed. That's why McGonagall brought you to me because she knew I was still looking for someone to take Charlie's place. I may not have seen that dive you did, but after your performance tonight I can tell you that there's no one better for the job,"" Wood squeezed his shoulder one more time before letting go and picking up the crate. ""Now come on, we've got to get back to the castle.""

They trudged back up to the castle, Wood happily telling Harry that the Quidditch Cup will have Gryffindor on it this year.

""I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons,"" Wood said.

Harry smiled happily as he reentered the common room and made his way back up to his dorm, though the smile dimmed a bit when he realized Draco had already gone to sleep. He had been planning on talking to him after his training session with Wood. Ron quickly distracted him though, asking questions about what he and Wood did until Percy came by and told them it was lights out. Harry lay down in his bed staring at his canopy, and as his eyes fluttered shut his gaze shifted to the foot of his bed, and for the first time he noticed the pair of antlers carved into the wood.



Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like a home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.

On Halloween morning they woke up to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry was glad to be partnered with Draco, though he felt bad for Seamus Finnigan, who was partnered with Neville, and Ron, who was working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to any of them since the day Harry's broomstick arrived.

""Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. ""Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is important, too - never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.""

It was very difficult. Harry and Draco swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. At the table on Harry's other side, Seamus got so fed up with his feather he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it - Harry had to put it out with his hat, as Neville had forgotten his again.

Ron, at the table on Draco's other side, wasn't having much more luck.

""Wingardium Leviosa!"" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.

""You're saying it wrong,"" Harry heard Hermione snap. ""It's Win-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.""

""You do it then if you're so clever,"" Ron snarled.

Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, ""Wingardium Leviosa!""

Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.

""Oh, well done!"" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ""Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!""

Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.

""It's no wonder no one can stand her,"" he said to Harry and Draco as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, ""she's a nightmare, honestly.""

Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face - and was startled to see that she was in tears.

""I think she heard you,"" said Harry.

""So?"" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. ""She must've noticed she's got no friends.""

""Yes, and you haven't any money, but that doesn't mean you want people making fun of you for it,"" Draco snapped and strode away from Ron and Harry. This was the most he had said to them since last week.

Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry, Ron, and Draco overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.

A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.

Harry noticed a lot of the students, and even a few of the professors were watching him and whispering. While this wasn't unusual for him since coming to Hogwarts, tonight it felt different.

""Why is everyone staring at me?"" he asked Draco. Draco paused in scooping stir-fry onto his plate and glanced around at the faces staring at Harry.

""Oh,"" said Draco, setting down the stir-fry plate and turning to Harry with wide grey eyes. ""It's because it's Halloween, I suppose.""

""What's Halloween got to do with anything?"" Harry asked, reaching for a dish of curry that looked especially delicious.

""Well, that's the day you defeated You-Know-Who,"" Draco said, casually, taking a bite of his stir-fry. Someone's utensils dropped, ringing loudly even among the chatter of the Great Hall, and Harry only realized they were his when Draco reached across the table to take his arm, shaking it slightly.

""Harry. Harry?""

""What?"" asked Harry, blinking at Draco.

""Are you alright?"" Draco asked.

""Yeah, yeah I suppose. It said that on the back of my card, that I defeated Voldemort today, but I guess I must've forgot,"" Harry looked down at his plate, at the naan and rice and curry, and couldn't help but wonder what his life would've been like if his parents hadn't died ten years ago tonight. If he had never become The Boy Who Lived.

Harry didn't have much time to think about all that just then, because Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, ""Troll - in the dungeons - thought you ought to know.""

He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.

There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.

""Prefects,"" he rumbled, ""lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!""

Percy was in his element.

""Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!""

""How could a troll get in?"" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.

""Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,"" said Ron.

""Well then, you're the closest thing to a troll we've got. You could give us a look into how their minds work,"" Draco said, smirking. Ron scowled at him, but Harry had to suppress his laughter.

""I bet Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke,"" huffed Ron.

They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry came to a sudden halt as he was jerked back by Draco pulling on his sleeve.

""Hermione doesn't know about the troll,"" Draco said with wide eyes. Harry felt his own eyes go wide and he grabbed Ron's arm.

""We've got to get Hermione.""

""What about Hermione?""

""She doesn't know about the troll, Ronald!"" Draco snaps.

Ron bit his lip.

""Oh, all right,"" he snapped. ""But Percy'd better not see us.""

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.

""Percy!"" hissed Ron, pulling Harry and Draco behind a large stone griffin.

Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.

""What's he doing?"" Harry whispered. ""Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?""

""Search me,"" Ron replied. Draco said nothing but bit his lip.

Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.

""He's heading for the third floor,"" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.

""Can you smell something?""

Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.

And then they heard it - a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed - at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.

It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.

The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.

""The key's in the lock,"" Harry muttered. ""We could lock it in.""

""Good idea,"" said Ron nervously.

""Just do it quick,"" Draco whispered, looking about.

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key and slam the door, but before he could lock it, Draco grabbed his arm.

""Wait!"" Draco hissed. ""That's the girls' bathroom!""

As if to accentuate this point the three boys froze in fear as a high, petrified scream came from inside the chamber.

""Hermione!"" they said together.

Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the wall as it went.

""Confuse it!"" Harry said desperately to his friends, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.

The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.

""Oy, pea-brain!"" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and giving Draco, who had slowly begun to creep around it, the opportunity to grab Hermione.

""Come on, Granger, you've got to run!"" Draco yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. Harry was yelling similar from where he was standing by the door.

The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.

Harry did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.

Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him with a terrible blow with the club.

Hermione, despite Draco's insistent pulling on her arm, had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: ""Wingardium Leviosa!""

The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the hair, turned slowly over - and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.

Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. Draco was still clutching Hermione's arm, though his grip had gone slack.

It was Hermione who spoke first.

""Is it - dead?""

""I don't think so,"" said Harry, ""I think it's just been knocked out.""

He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy grey glue.

""Urgh - troll boogers.""

He wiped it on the troll's trousers.

A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the four of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.

Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron, Harry, and Draco (who had finally let go of Hermione's arm and joined his two friends). Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.

""What on earth were you thinking of?"" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Draco, then Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. ""You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?""

Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.

Then a small voice came out of the shadows.

""Please, Professor McGonagall - they were looking for me.""

""Miss Granger!""

Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.

""I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know, because I've read all about them.""

Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?

""If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Draco was trying to get me to safety, Harry stuck his wand up its nose, and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.""

The three boys tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.

""Well - in that case..."" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the four of them, ""Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?""

Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.

""Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,"" said Professor McGonagall. ""I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.""

Hermione left.

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry, Ron, and Draco.

""Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points, for sheer dumb luck. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.""

They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.

""We should have gotten more than fifteen points,"" Ron grumbled.

""Ten, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.""

""Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,"" Ron admitted. ""Mind you, we did save her.""

""She might not have needed saving, Ronald, if you hadn't driven her to cry in the bathroom in the first place,"" Draco reminded him.

They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.

""Pig snout,"" they said and entered.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said ""Thanks,"" and hurried off to get plates.

But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

A few changes this chapter, such as during the Quidditch match I use more of Lee Jordan's excellent commentating skills to describe the match. Also at the end of the chapter, I've added an extra scene with the gang in the dorms.

So sorry about how long it's been, I had a family emergency that took me away from writing for a bit, and I got sidetracked by another story I've been writing. I'll try to get more of this out this year, but no promises.

As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.

The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the House Championship.

Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse - people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.

It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her and Draco's help, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Not that Harry didn't appreciate Ron and Draco telling him their experiences with Quidditch, of course.

Harry had learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and then turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.

Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since the boys had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. She had confided in Harry one night as she was helping him with his History of Magic paper that she had been worried they would kick her out if she broke any of the rules, which Harry assured her he understood. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the four of them were out in the freezing courtyard during the break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, Draco, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.

""What's that you've got there, Potter?""

It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.

""Library books are not to be taken outside the school,"" said Snape. ""Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.""

""You just made that rule up!"" Draco protested. Snape leveled his scowl at Draco.

""Another five points from Gryffindor, Mr. Malfoy, for talking back to a teacher.""

""There go the points we got for fighting that troll,"" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. ""Wonder what's wrong with his leg?""

""Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,"" said Ron bitterly.



The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. The four of them sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy her work (""How will you learn?""), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Draco didn't need help with his Charms work since he and Hermione were neck and neck to be top of the class.

Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up he told his friends he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.

""Better you than me,"" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening. Draco watched him go with pinched lips but didn't say anything.

Harry reentered the common room some minutes later, panting after having just sprinted back upstairs, and walked back over to his friends.

""Did you get it?"" Ron asked as Harry joined them. ""What's the matter?""

In a low whisper, Harry told them about overhearing Snape and Filch.

""You know what this means?"" he asked breathlessly. ""He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. That's where he was going when he saw him - he's after whatever it's guarding. And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion.""

Hermione's eyes were wide.

""No - he wouldn't,"" she said. ""I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.""

""Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"" snapped Ron. ""I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape.""

""What about you, Draco? What do you think?"" Harry asked.

""I don't know,"" Draco mumbled, not looking anyone in the eye. ""He's a Slytherin, so he wouldn't go after it if it wasn't in his best interest. I can't really think of anything worth going against Dumbledore, but I suppose it depends.""

""On what?"" Ron asked.

""What's that dog guarding?""

Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with that same question. Harry couldn't sleep, no matter how hard he tried. He tried to empty his mind - he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours - but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen the leg wasn't easy to forget.



The next morning dawned bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.

""You've got to eat some breakfast,"" Ron said through a mouthful of his own breakfast.

""I don't want anything.""

""Just a bit of toast,"" wheedled Hermione.

""I'm not hungry.""

Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time, he'd be walking onto the field.

""Harry, you need your strength,"" said Seamus Finnigan. ""Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.""

""Oh, honestly Finnigan, can't you see how nervous Harry is?"" Draco snapped at the Irishman, who was piling ketchup onto his sausages. ""You'll do great, Harry, you're a natural. Now, eat your bhatura before I do, they're quite good.""



By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats may be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.

Draco, Ron, and Hermione joined the other Gryffindor boys up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. Draco, not to be outdone, had performed his own charm to make the lion roar every so often.

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).

Wood cleared his throat for silence.

""Okay, men,"" he said.

""And women,"" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

""And women,"" Wood agreed. ""This is it.""

""The big one,"" said Fred Weasley.

""The one we've all been waiting for,"" said George.

""We know Oliver's speech by heart,"" Fred told Harry, ""we were on the team last year.""

""Shut up you two,"" said Wood. ""This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years. We're going to win, I know it.""

He glared at them all as if to say, ""Or else.""

""Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you.""

Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.

Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.

""Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,"" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.

""Mount your brooms, please.""

Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.

Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.

""And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too -""

""JORDAN!""

""Sorry, Professor.""

The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.

""And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good friend of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes - Flint flying like an eagle up there - he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and - OUCH - that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger - the Quaffle is taken by the Slytherins - that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goalposts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger - sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which - nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes - she's really flying - dodges a speeding Bludger - the goalposts are ahead - come on, now, Angelina - Keeper Bletchly dives - misses - GRYFFINDORS SCORE!""

Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.

Way up above the stands Harry saw as Hagrid joined his friends, noticeable due to the roaring banner and Draco and Ron's hair. Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan, for him to keep out of the way until he saw the Snitch.

When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. He thought he caught sight of the Snitch, though it turned out to be one of the Weasley's watches, and he had to dodge a stray Bludger, though mostly he was just flying around looking for the Snitch.

""Slytherin in possession,"" Lee Jordan was saying, ""Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the - wait a moment - was that the Snitch?""

A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.

""Harry Potter, youngest Seeker in a century and Gryffindor's newest player, dives for the Snitch, Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs close on his heels. Both Seekers are neck and neck - Potter puts on a burst of speed and - OUCH! Potter slams into Flint, who seemed to have blocked the young Seeker on purpose the cheating-""

""JORDAN!""

""Sorry, Professor. Madam Hooch has called Flint over and seems to be reprimanding him for blocking Seeker Potter. The Snitch seems to have disappeared again,"" Jordan commented as the Gryffindor stands continued to yell foul.

Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, ""Send him off, ref! Red card!""

""What are you talking about, Dean?"" said Ron.

""Red card!"" said Dean furiously. ""In football, you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!""

""This isn't football, Dean,"" Draco reminded him.

Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.

""They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.""

Lee Jordan was finding it hard not to take sides.

""So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating -""

""Jordan!"" growled Professor McGonagall.

""I mean, after that open and revolting foul -""

""Jordan, I'm warning you -""

""All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue to play, Gryffindor still in possession.""

Draco watched the game resume with a pinched mouth and his binoculars held firmly against his eyes, occasionally checking on Harry. His concern for his friend allowed him to catch the moment Harry dodged a dangerously close Bludger and the sudden, frightening lurch Harry's broom gave soon after.

""Did you see that?"" asked Draco. He lowered his binoculars and looked at Ron and Hermione.

""See what, mate? Not all of us have fancy binoculars,"" said Ron, his eyes still locked on the jumble of red and green robes overhead. Hermione simply shrugged.

Draco raised his binoculars again searched the sky for Harry, who was only distinguishable from the rest of the Gryffindor players through his size. When Draco's binoculars landed on him he was clinging to his broom tightly with both his hands and knees as the broom lurched as though it was trying to buck him off. But the Nimbus Two Thousand did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Draco watched the broom and Harry and realized with a sickening lurch in his stomach that Harry had no control of the broom. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated the young Seeker.

Lee was still commenting.

""Slytherin in possession - Flint with the Quaffle - passes Spinnet - passes Bell - hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose - only joking, Professor - Slytherins score - oh no...""

The Slytherins were cheering which, along with the Gryffindors groans, masked Draco's shout of worry. No one else seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.

""Hagrid, look at Harry!"" Draco said.

Hagrid raised his own binoculars and frowned at what he saw.

""Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,"" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. ""If I didn't know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...""

Suddenly people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. Draco quickly raised his binoculars again. Harry's broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.

""Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?"" Seamus whispered.

""It didn't start lurching like that until he dodged a Bludger,"" said Draco. ""Do you think that could have done something?""

""Can't've been either,"" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. ""Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic - no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.""

At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.

""What are you doing?"" moaned Ron, gray-faced.

""I knew it,"" Hermione gasped, ""Snape - look.""

Ron grabbed the binoculars from Hermione as Draco swung his own to the teachers stands. Snape had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. Draco felt his stomach drop.

""Oh no,"" Draco moaned.

""He's doing something - jinxing the broom,"" said Hermione.

""What should we do?"" Ron asked.

""Leave it to me.""

Before Ron or Draco could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.

""Ron, keep your binoculars on Harry, I'll watch Snape,"" Draco instructed, already raising his back to his eyes.

Ron trained the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.

""Come on, Hermione,"" Ron muttered desperately.

""Ron, I can see her,"" whispered Draco, having caught a glimpse of her bushy mane. ""She's in the teachers stand, she just knocked over Professor Quirrell and now she's lighting Snape's robes on fire.""

""What?"" Ron exclaimed as he swung his binoculars over to Snape as Draco swung his over to Harry. Sure enough, his robes were slowly being engulfed by bright blue flames as the rest of the teachers hurried to try and put them out.

It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. Draco gave out a whoop of joy as his friend climbed back onto his broom.

""Nevile, you can look!"" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.

Harry was speeding toward the ground when Draco and the rest of the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick - he hit the field on all fours - coughed - and something gold fell into his hand.

""I've got the Snitch!"" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.

""He caught the Snitch!"" Draco shouted, dropping his binoculars around his neck and throwing his arms around Ron and Hermione as she retook her seat.

The trio raced down the stands, shoving their way past excited Gryffindors, as they fought toward the pitch. As soon as they saw him, the friends launched themselves at Harry and began congratulating him and fussing over him in the same breath.

""He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,"" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference - Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Draco, Ron, and Hermione.

""It was Snape,"" Ron was explaining, ""we saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.""

""Rubbish,"" said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. ""Why would Snape do somethin' like that?""

Draco bit his lip as he and the others looked at one another, each of them wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.

""I found out something about him,"" he told Hagrid. ""He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding.""

Hagrid dropped his teapot.

""How do you know about Fluffy?"" he said.

""You named it Fluffy?"" Draco exclaimed.

""Yeah, bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the -""

""Yes?"" said Harry eagerly.

""Now, don't ask me anymore,"" said Hagrid gruffly. ""That's top secret stuff, that is.""

""But Snape's trying to steal it,"" Harry insisted.

""Rubbish,"" said Hagrid again. ""Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort.""

""So why did he just try to kill Harry?"" cried Hermione.

The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.

""I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!""

""When he stopped looking, Harry's broom stopped trying to buck him off,"" Draco added, still biting his lip and occasionally glancing at Harry.

""I'm tellin' yeh, yet wrong!"" said Hagrid hotly. ""I don't know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all four of yeh - yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel -""

""Aha!"" said Harry, ""so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?""

Hagrid looked furious with himself.

""I shouldn' have told yeh that,"" he muttered. ""Get on back to the castle now, it's late. An' stop thinkin' about what Fluffy's guardin'!""

The four reluctantly left and began the trudge up to the castle. Hermione and Ron immediately got into an argument about something as Draco and Harry hung back.

""Are you alright, Harry?"" Draco asked, glancing at the darker-skinned boy. Harry shrugged and pushed his glasses up.

""Bit shaken, I guess. Mostly I'm happy I didn't lose my glasses, I don't think the Dursley's would've gotten me a new pair if I had. What do you think Fluffy's guarding, and why does Snape want it so bad?""

""I don't know,"" Draco answered.

""Do you know why he hates me so much?"" Harry asked suddenly, shoving his hands into his pockets. Draco glanced over at him and sighed.

""Well, I think I remember overhearing something about him and your dad not getting along. They were in the same year, along with your mum.""

""But why does he hate me?""

Draco bit his lip again and glanced over at Harry. They had reached the moving staircases by then. Hermione and Ron were still arguing, though the subject may have changed. Draco glanced at the two before turning back to Harry.

""Can we talk about it in the dorm?""

Harry nodded and followed his friends off the moving staircase. Hermione led them through the portrait and into the common room.

""Hey, Hermione, do you want to join us in our dorm?"" Harry asked before Hermione could climb the stairs to the girl's dorm.

Once in the dorm the three boys took seats on their beds, Hermione taking the empty bed next to the bathroom.

Harry looked over at Draco, expecting him to say something. As Harry watched, Draco screwed up his face and straightened his back. The blond took a deep breath.

""Professor Snape is a Death Eater,"" he said - as if it were a simple fact of life.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron stared at Draco as if he had just said that his father was Voldemort.

""Draco, you can't just go around accusing people of being,"" Hermione looked around and lowered her voice, ""Death Eaters.""

""I'm not accusing anyone, Hermione,"" Draco hissed, ""I saw his Dark Mark.""

""When?"" Ron asked.

""How?"" Hermione added.

""Sev- er, Snape is my godfather. He was at the Manor over the summer, tutoring me in Potions so I would be prepared for Hogwarts, and he had rolled up his sleeve. I caught a glimpse of his mark - it's a bright red snake and skull. My- my father has one too,"" Draco looked at his hands.

""So, what does that mean?"" Harry asked.

""It means Snape has motive,"" Hermione answered. ""It explains why he hates you so much! You're the Boy Who Lived, Harry, you defeated You-Know-Who, any Death Eater would hold a grudge.""

""Then why hasn't he just killed me? He's had plenty of chances for it,"" Harry asked.

""Because of Dumbledore,"" Draco answered.

""That's right, Snape would never dare do anything with Dumbledore around,"" Hermione agreed.

""Even You-Know-Who was scared of him, Snape's got no chance,"" Ron added.

Harry wasn't sure if he felt better, but he thanked them none the less.

Later, as he was laying in bed trying to sleep, Harry couldn't help but think about all the mysteries of his life. Why did Voldemort try to kill him? Why did Dumbledore send him to live with the Dursleys? Why did everyone get weird around him when they talked about Sirius Black? Harry didn't know the answers to any of those questions, but he was determined to answer the one that was circling his head the most. What was Fluffy guarding?

I hope you guys like this chapter. It was interesting to write since religion in Harry Potter isn't very clear. They seem to predominately celebrate Christmas, but I'm assuming other wizards follow different religions. Like, there must be Jewish wizards or Hindu wizards or even Pagan wizards, since there are apparently Christian wizards. I'm not even going to go into how magic plays into their religion - if it does - but know that I've thought about it and it has caused me a lot of stress.

So, since Harry and James are Indian and there was some mention of James making colored lights for Harry around Halloween 1981 - which is close to Diwali (the Hindu festival of lights) - I've decided to use the Hindu Potters headcanon. In that same regard, the Blacks (including Narcissa and Draco) follow the Buddhist faith. I did some research and these appear to be the most common religions for these ethnicities in the United Kingdom.

Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid, causing some panic over the well-being of the giant squid that lived there, as well as the mermaids and other such lake-dwelling creatures. The Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.

Draco had already celebrated one holiday earlier in December. He said it was called Bodhi Day, a Buddhist holiday that he and his mother would celebrate together before celebrating Christmas with his father. Harry admired the colored lights Draco had spelled onto a small tree the house elves had brought into the dorm, they reminded him of the lights the Patil twins had conjured for Diwali in November. Harry was fascinated by the different holidays, especially the ones Parvati had taken to teaching him about since the Dursleys only ever celebrated the Christian ones. Harry didn't know what religion his father followed - if he followed any at all - but Padma and Parvati assured him that most Indian purebloods were Hindu. Harry still wished he could ask his father. He wished he could ask his father a lot of things.

No one could wait for the holidays to start so they could get back to their families and out of the Scottish chill. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all was Professor Snape's class down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.

""I feel so sorry,"" said Pansy Parkinson, one Potions class, ""for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home.""

She was looking over at Draco and Harry as she spoke. Zabini laughed outright at them, and Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out the powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Though he did spare a moment to rest a hand on Draco's arm before the other boy did something rash. Parkinson and Zabini had been more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, Zabini had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Pansy had tried suggesting a niffler take his place since he was obviously focusing on the gold because he was poor. No one paid them much attention because they were more impressed with the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So instead they went back to taunting Harry about having no proper family, with the occasional jab at Draco for being disowned.

It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas, just as Draco wouldn't be returning to Malfoy Manor. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and the two of them had signed up at once. Draco was understandably still upset at his new circumstances, but Harry didn't feel sorry for himself at all. This would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.

When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.

""Hi, Hagrid, want any help?"" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.

""Nah, I'm alright, thanks, Ron.""

""Would you mind moving out of the way?"" came Parkinson's nasal drawl from behind them.

""Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose - that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to,"" Zabini added, leaning against Parkinson's shoulder.

""Do say hello to your mother for me, Blaise,"" Draco drawled, rolling his eyes as Harry and Hermione held Ron back, ""and give my regards to her newest husband. What is this one again? The fifth? Sixth?""

It was Parkinson's turn to hold Zabini back. At some point, Snape came up the stairs behind them. He merely regarded the scene, cooly, before continuing along the corridor. Zabini and Parkinson sneered at the foursome before continuing down the corridor, pushing roughly past the tree followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle.

Hagrid invited them to walk with him to the Great Hall, where he was taking his tree to join the others being decorated for the holidays.

Ron was still seething when they reached the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with Christmas decorations.

""Ah, Hagrid, the last tree - put it in the far corner, would you?""

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. Harry idly wondered how the candles didn't catch the tree on fire before he decided they must be magical candles.

""How many days you got left until yer holidays?"" Hagrid asked.

""Just one,"" said Hermione. ""And that reminds me - we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.""

""Oh yeah, you're right,"" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.

""The library?"" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. ""Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh? Yer mum was like that, Harry, if I remember right, always lookin' up somethin'.""

""Oh, we're not working,"" Harry told him brightly, only slightly distracted by the new information about his mother.

""We're been researching Nicolas Flamel,"" Draco added.

""You what?"" Hagrid looked shocked. ""Listen here - I've told yeh - drop it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'.""

""We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,"" said Hermione.

""Unless you'd like to tell us yourself? It would save us a lot of trouble,"" Draco said.

""We've already gone through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere - just give us a hint - I know I've read his name somewhere,"" Harry added.

""I'm sayin' nothin',"" said Hagrid flatly.

""Just have to find out ourselves, then,"" said Ron, and they left Hagrid mumbling to himself as they hurried off to the library. Harry could've sworn he heard Hagrid mention his father as they left.

They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time though Harry was; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.

Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off shelves at random. Draco wandered over to the biographies section where he was slowly making his way through the various books on Dumbledore, certain he'd find some mention of the other man. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look at any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.

""What are you looking for, boy?""

""Nothing,"" said Harry

Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.

""You'd better get out, then. You Potters, always mucking about with your friends, making a mess of my library. Go on - out!""

Harry left the library, mulling over his newest piece of information about his dad. Hagrid said his mum was always in the library, but Madam Pince had compared him to his dad. Perhaps they would study together? Harry smiled to himself as he entertained the idea of his parents meeting for study dates together, sneaking in food and hiding deep in the stacks to avoid Madam Pince's wrath. She made quite the terrifying figure even now as an elderly woman - no doubt she was even more imposing when his parents were at Hogwarts. That was part of the reason they had decided not to ask the librarian where they could find Flamel. The other reason was that they didn't want to risk Snape hearing what they were up to.

Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other three had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.

Five minutes later, Ron, Hermione, and Draco joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.

""You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?"" said Hermione. ""And send me an owl if you find anything.""

""And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,"" said Ron. ""It'd be safe to ask them.""

""Very safe, as they're both dentists,"" said Hermione.



The three boys found themselves distracted from their search for Flamel once the castle emptied for the holidays. With the common room mostly empty, they found themselves sitting by the fire toasting anything they could spear on a fork - bread, English muffins, marshmallows - and plotting ways of getting Parkinson and Zabini expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work.

Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess as far as Harry knew, except the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family - in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.

Harry played with chessmen Draco lent him, and they were too new to be of any real use to him. He also wasn't a very good player yet, but it didn't help that they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. ""Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.""

Eventually he gave up and let Ron and Draco play each other. They were both well-versed in wizard's chess and their matches lasted much longer than Ron and Harry's. Harry spent much of the time they were playing sitting by the fire and thinking of his parents. He wondered if there was a wizard afterlife and if there was if his parents were watching him from it.

On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.

""Happy Christmas,"" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. Draco was still asleep, but Harry noted he also had a fairly decent number of gifts at the end of his bed.

""You, too,"" said Harry. ""Will you look at this? I've got some presents!""

""What did you expect, turnips?"" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's.

Harry glanced between his presents and Draco's sleeping form before making up his mind.

""Draco! Draco, wake up, it's Christmas!"" Harry shouted, jumping on the blond's bed and shaking his shoulders. Draco grumbled and swatted at Harry, but he eventually sat up. He glared at Harry for a moment before noticing the packages at the foot of his bed. His face went slack with shock before a smile slowly crept on his face.

""I've got presents,"" he whispered.

""It's Christmas isn't it? What's up with you lot, you look like you've never gotten Christmas gifts before,"" Ron said, tearing into one of his gifts.

""The Dursleys used to just get me socks for Christmas if they remembered to get me anything,"" Harry commented, gravitating towards his pile of gifts.

""I didn't think I'd get anything this year,"" Draco whispered as if speaking too loud would scare his presents away. Ron stared at the two of them with some mix of horror and pity, but neither of them noticed.

Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, From Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it - it sounded a bit like an owl.

A second, very small parcel contained a note.

We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.

""That's friendly,"" said Harry.

Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.

""Weird!"" he said, ""What a shape! This is money?""

""You can keep it,"" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. ""What've you got Draco?""

Harry turned and caught Draco staring at a note in his hands, his eyes suspiciously damp.

""Draco?""

Draco sniffed and wiped at his eyes, but when he turned toward Harry he had a grin on his face.

""It's from my aunt Andromeda, she was disowned when she married a Muggleborn. Here, read this,"" Draco shoved the note under Harry's nose and pointed to a paragraph about midway down the letter.




Welcome to the black sheep of the Black family, Draco. I assure you we are a wonderful bunch and we are so happy to have you. You are more than welcome to stay with my husband and me over the summer, our daughter Nymphadora is off training to be an Auror and we've been going through a bit of an empty nest crisis. You can rest assured that I will be sending my dear sister a very strongly worded letter on your behalf as well.


""Wow,"" Harry gasped, handing the letter back. ""But, the Black family? I thought your last name was Malfoy?""

""It's my mother's maiden name,"" Draco said, avoiding Harry's eyes.

""Like Sirius Black?"" Harry asked. From the way Draco refused to meet his gaze, he figured he was right. ""That's the cousin you keep talking about, isn't it? The one Nearly Headless Nick said was friends with my parents?""

""Yes. He's my first cousin once removed on my mother's side. We don't really talk about him.""

""Come on, it's Christmas, let's open some more presents!"" Ron wheedled, shoving nearly identical packages into Harry and Draco's arms. ""Here, these are from my mum. I told her you didn't expect to get any presents, so - oh no,"" Ron groaned as the two of them opened their gifts, ""she's made you Weasley sweaters.""

Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. Draco opened something similar, though his sweater was in a steel blue color. It was a near uncanny match for his eyes and Harry wondered how Mrs. Weasley had known.

""Every year she makes us a sweater,"" said Ron, unwrapping his own, ""and mine's always maroon.""

""That's really nice of her,"" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.

His next present also contained candy - a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. Draco got a whole package of licorice wands and Ron got a box of Berty Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

This left only one parcel for him to open. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.

Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron and Draco gasped.

""I've heard of those,"" he said in a hushed voice, dropping his box of Every Flavor Beans. ""If that's what I think it is - they're really rare, and really valuable.""

""They're not just rare,"" Draco cut in, ""they're unheard of! My father says there's only one real cloak, and that the others are just bits of fabric with really strong Disillusionment charms on them.""

""But what is it?""

Harry picked up the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.

""It's an Invisibility Cloak,"" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. ""I'm sure it is - try it on.""

Harry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and his friends gave a yell.

""It is!""

""Look down!""

Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the Cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.

""There's a note!"" said Ron suddenly. ""A note fell out of it!""

Harry pulled off the Cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:




Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.
A Very Happy Christmas to you


There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the Cloak.

""I'd give anything for one of these,"" he said. ""Anything. What's the matter?""

""Nothing,"" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the Cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?

""Well, now I'm glad I decided to get you my gift,"" Draco said. He looked under his bed and pulled out a hastily wrapped parcel and handed it over to Harry.

Harry smiled at his friend and handed him his own messily wrapped package. He then tore into the wrapping paper and smiled at the well-loved book he unearthed.

""The Tales of Beetle the Bard?"" Harry asked.

""What the bloody hell is a Hobbit?"" Draco asked, equally perplexed.

Before either could answer the other's question, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the Cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing with anyone else yet.

""Happy Christmas!""

""Hey, look - Harry and Draco have Weasley sweaters, too!""

Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. Somehow, Harry didn't think they were wearing the correct ones.

""Theirs are better than ours, though,"" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. ""She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.

""Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?"" George demanded. ""Come one, get it on, they're lovely and warm.""

""I hate maroon,"" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. Harry and Draco followed suit, so as to not invoke the twins more mischevious sides.

""You haven't got a letter on yours,"" George observed. ""I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid - we know we're called Gred and Forge.""

Harry snorted out a quick laugh, Draco shoving his sharp elbow into his ribs, even though he was also smiling.

""What's all this noise?""

Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.

""P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Draco got one.""

""I - don't - want -"" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.

""And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,"" said George. ""Christmas is a time for family.""

They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.



Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. There seemed to be piles of food, far more than the handful of students and teachers left for the holidays, and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, exchanging cheap plastic toys and paper crowns for a myriad of magical items and elaborate headwear.

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the dinner. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.

When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack on non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.

Harry, Draco, and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy and Draco hadn't argued so much over how to help him.

After a meal of Christmas leftovers, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.

It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Even Draco, who usually stayed up most of the night, was out like a light as soon as his head hit the pillow. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.

His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.

He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the Cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.

Use it well.

Suddenly, Harry felt wide awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this Cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Is this what his dad felt when he first put on the Cloak?

Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him and Draco? Something held him back - his father's Cloak - he felt that this time - the first time - he wanted to use it alone.

He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.

""Who's there?"" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked down the corridor and after a brief pause headed toward the library and the Restricted Section.

As he walked he couldn't help but wonder how many times his father walked these same steps to this same destination under this same Cloak. Had his mother ever joined him under the Cloak? And who gave him the Cloak?

The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry was grateful Draco had taught him the Lumos spell earlier in the year, as Professor Quirrell still hadn't gotten around to teaching it yet and a floating lamp would look suspicious, even in a wizarding school.

The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his wand to read the titles.

They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.

He had to start somewhere. Kneeling down carefully, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. After putting his wand in his mouth to free his hands he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence - the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward, tripping over the edge of the Cloak and extinguishing his wand. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside - stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf and hastily pulling the Cloak back on, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.

He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. Quickly casting Lumos again didn't help any either, he didn't recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchen he knew, but he must be five floors above there.

""You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library - Restricted Section.""

Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, ""The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.

Harry extinguished his wand with a quiet 'Nox' and stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him - the Cloak didn't stop him from being solid.

He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief, he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. The walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.

It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket - but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.

His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.

He had to clap his hands over his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed - for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.

But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.

There he was, reflected in it, pale and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder - but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?

Looking back toward the mirror, Harry took a closer look at the figures behind him, and very nearly screamed again. For there behind him were his parents, looking just like they did in their chocolate frog cards. His mother was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes were just like his. Bright green - exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. His father, a tall, thin, dark-haired man, put his arm around her. He wore glasses, his hair was untidy, and his dark skin had the same golden hue as his. His hair stuck up at the back, just like Harry's did. Harry tried to reach behind him to touch them, hug them, anything, but there was nothing there. If they were really there, he'd touch them, but he felt only air - his parents and the others only existed in the mirror.

""Mum?"" he whispered. ""Dad?""

They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees - Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay there, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, ""I'll come back,"" and hurried from the room.



""You could have woken me up,"" said Ron, crossly.

""You should have woken me up, if you were going to the Restricted Section. I know more about the Dark Arts than either of you,"" Draco said, his arms crossed tightly over his chest.

""You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you both the mirror.""

""I'd like to see your family,"" Ron said eagerly, ""I mean you've stared at those chocolate frog cards enough.""

""And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your older brothers and everyone.""

""There are plenty of Weasleys around here at Hogwarts, why would you want to see more?"" Draco asked.

Ron glared at Draco. Even after knowing Draco for months, he still held on to some of those old pureblood grudges. Draco wasn't innocent in their spats either, but Harry had learned to ignore them.

""You can meet them over the summer at my house,"" said Ron. ""Anyways, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some sausage or something, why aren't you eating anything?""

Harry couldn't eat but didn't stop Ron from trying to serve him some sausage. It never made it to his plate. Parvati spelled it back onto the serving dish and sent a stinging hex at Ron while she was at it. Harry barely paid attention as Parvati chewed out Ron for trying to give Harry something that was tamasic.

Maybe he could ask his dad about that when he saw him again tonight. He had forgotten all about Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was guarding? what did it matter if Snape stole it, really?

""Are you feeling alright, Harry?"" Draco asked. Ron was still being lectured on Hindu diets by Parvati. ""You look a bit off.""



What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron and Draco covered in the Cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly that night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.

""I'm freezing,"" said Ron. ""Let's forget it and go back.""

""For once, I agree with Ron.""

""No!"" Harry hissed. ""I know it's here somewhere.""

When they did finally find it, Harry dropped the Cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.

There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.

""See?"" Harry whispered.

""I can't see anything.""

""Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...""

""I can only see you.""

""What about you, Draco, you can see them, can't you?""

""No, Harry...""

""Well, look in it properly, here Draco, stand where I am.""

Harry stepped aside, but with Draco in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Draco in his silk pajamas.

""Do you see them?"" Harry asked.

Draco shook his head, but his face was struck with a look of pure awe. His grey eyes were slowly filling with tears.

""I see my mother,"" he gasped. ""She's smiling at me, she looks proud. And you're there Harry."" He sobbed softly, ""She's hugging us. She said she's proud of me, and she loves me, I can see her lips moving.""

He raised his arms up as if trying to hold onto the phantom of his mother's hug. When he only touched his own shoulder he sobbed and turned away from the mirror, Ron taking his place quickly.

Draco sat on the floor and cried into his arms. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.

""Look at me!"" he said.

""Can you see your family standing around you?""

""No - I'm alone - but I'm different - I look older - and I'm Head Boy!""

""What?""

""I am - I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to - and I'm holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup - I'm Quidditch captain, too!""

Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.

""Do you think this mirror shows the future?""

""How can it? All my family are dead - let me have another look -""

""You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.""

""You're only holding the Quidditch Cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents.""

""Don't push me -""

""Stop it.""

Ron and Harry stopped struggling and turned to Draco, who had finally gotten off the floor.

""There's no use fighting over it, it's all just lies anyway,"" he said.

""What do you mean?""

""The mirror only shows you what you want to see. None of it's real, it can't be. Harry's never going to know his family, my mother's never going to love me again, and Ron's probably never going to be Head Boy or Quidditch Captain! It's just showing us our fantasies!""

A sudden noise outside in the corridor stopped Ron or Harry from replying. They hadn't realized how loudly they'd been talking.

""Quick!""

Ron threw the Cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. They stood quite still, all thinking the same thing - did the Cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned at left.

""We need to go back, she's probably gone to fetch Filch. Come on.""

And Draco pulled them out of the room.



The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.

""Want to play chess, Harry?"" said Ron.

""No, you and Draco keep going.""

""Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?""

""No... you go...""

""Harry, I know what you're thinking, and you shouldn't,"" Draco said. ""Don't go back to the mirror tonight.""

""Why not?""

""I've heard stories of enchanted mirrors, and they never end well. Most wizards go mad in front of them, some have even died, and I don't want you to suffer the same fate,"" Draco pleaded.

""Besides,"" cut in Ron, ""you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?""

""You both sound like Hermione.""

""Harry, we're serious. Don't go, please.""

But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to go back in front of the mirror, and his friends weren't going to stop him.



The third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.

And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. His family all smiled out at him, only this time, walking out from behind his family, a boy with nearly silver hair. Draco stood beside his parents for a moment, smiling, before sinking down to the floor to sit beside him. Harry turned his head, but as he expected, Draco was only in the mirror. He turned back to the mirror and thought that there was nothing that could stop him from sitting here with his family all night. Nothing at all.

Except -

""So - back again, Harry?""

Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting there on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.

""I - I didn't see you, sir.""

""Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,"" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.

""So,"" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, ""you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.""

""I didn't know it was called that, sir.""

""But I expect you've realized by now what it does?""

""It - well - it shows me my family -""

""And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy and your friend Draco his mother.""

""How did you know - ?""

""I don't need a cloak to become invisible,"" said Dumbledore gently. ""Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all? Your friend Draco came close to figuring it out the other night.""

""It shows us what we want... whatever we want.""

""Yes and no,"" said Dumbledore quietly. ""It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. Draco Malfoy, who has just been outcast from his family, sees his mother's love, and the love of a best friend. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.

""The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don't you put on that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?""

Harry stood up.

""Sir - Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you a question?""

""Obviously, you've just done so,"" Dumbledore smiled. ""You may ask me one more thing, however.""

""What do you see when you look in the mirror?""

""I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.""

Harry stared.

""One can never have enough socks,"" said Dumbledore. ""Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.""

It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.

Harry had just closed his eyes when his curtain was pulled back and the pale form of Draco Malfoy suddenly invaded his bed. Draco's wand was lit and his face held in a scowl.

""You went back, didn't you?""

Harry blinked at the sudden light that was invading his bed and fumbled to put his glasses back on.

""What?""

""You went back to the mirror!"" Draco whispered harshly. ""Harry, what were you thinking? I told you that mirror's no good -""

""Don't worry, Draco, I won't be going back,"" Harry interrupted him. ""Dumbledore's moving it.""

Draco paused and seemed to deflate.

""Oh. That's... good. Good. It was dangerous to leave such a powerful object laying around where anyone could find it.""

""Can I go to sleep now?"" Harry asked.

""What? Oh, yes, of course. Goodnight Harry.""

""Goodnight Draco.""

Draco crawled out of Harry's bed and back into his own, extinguishing his wand as he did. Harry took his glasses off and set them back on his nightstand.

""Harry?""

""Yes, Draco?""

""It was nice, wasn't it? Seeing your family?""

Harry smiled.

""Yeah, it was.""

The dorm was silent for a moment, aside from Ron's snoring.

""I miss my mother,"" Draco whispered quietly.

""Me too, Draco.""

They fell to silence again, then slowly fell asleep. Harry's hand under his pillow rested against the chocolate frog cards of his family. He slept with a smile and dreamed of soft voices singing him to sleep.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the holidays, the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't. When he wasn't up all night staring at the chocolate frog cards, he was having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.

""You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,"" said Ron, when Harry told him and Draco about these dreams.

""Harry, are you sure these are just dreams?"" Draco asked him later that night when they were alone. It had become somewhat of a habit for them, staying up late at night and crawling into each other's beds to talk.

""Why?""

""I've overheard my father talking about the War with my mother a few times. He says the thing he remembers most about serving the Dark Lord, er, Voldemort, was the bright green light of the killing curse,"" explained Draco, haltingly. Harry wasn't sure how he felt about dreaming of his parents' deaths nearly every night.

Hermione, who came back a day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (""If Filch had caught you!""), and disappointed that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.

They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other three, because Quidditch practice had started again.

Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired after training.

Then Harry and the rest of the team found out the reason for Wood's relentless training. Snape would be refereeing their match against Hufflepuff. Wood was trying to make sure everyone played a clean game to give Snape the least amount of cause for taking away points, but Harry was more concerned for his own safety. After what happened the last match and what Draco had told him, Harry didn't want Snape anywhere near him when he was playing Quidditch.

The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess while Draco watched. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something the boys thought was very good for her. Draco and Ron took turns playing against her when they weren't playing against each other.

Ron didn't look up from where he was concentrating on the chess board, but Draco looked over when Harry sat down next to him.

""What happened?"" Draco asked, ""You look terrible.""

Speaking quietly so no one would hear, Harry told them about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.

""Don't play,"" said Hermione at once.

""Say you're ill,"" said Ron.

""Pretend to break your leg,"" Hermione suggested.

""Really break your leg,"" said Ron.

""Are you two mad?"" Draco asked, staring at the other two in puzzlement. ""Harry can't back out, there isn't a reserve Seeker. Gryffindor wouldn't be able to play at all, which means Slytherin would win the House Championship again!""

At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb into the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.

Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.

""What happened?"" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry, Ron, and Draco.

""Nott,"" said Neville shakily. ""I met him, Parkinson, and Zabini outside the library. He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on.""

""Go to Professor McGonagall!"" Hermione urged Neville. ""Report him!""

Neville shook his head.

""I don't want more trouble,"" he mumbled.

""You've got to stand up to them, Neville!"" said Ron. ""They're used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in from of them and make it easier.""

""There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Parkinson's already done that,"" Neville choked out.

Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.

""You're worth twelve of them,"" Harry said. ""The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where are they? In Slytherin with all the other snakes.""

If Harry had looked, he would have caught Draco's flinch, but he was more focused on the weak smile Neville gave him as he unwrapped the frog.

""Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?""

As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.

""Dumbledore again,"" he said, ""He was the first one I ever -""

He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron, Draco, and Hermione.

""I've found him!"" he whispered. ""I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here - listen to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!""

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.

""Stay there!"" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. The boys barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.

""I never thought to look in here!"" she whispered excitedly. ""I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.""

""Light?"" said Ron.

""So that's where that book went!"" Draco exclaimed. ""I've been trying to get my hands on it myself.""

Hermione shushed them and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.

At last she found was she was looking for.

""I knew it! I knew it!""

""Are we allowed to speak yet?"" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.

""Nicolas Flamel,"" she whispered dramatically, ""is the is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""

""Of course!"" Draco gasped.

Harry and Ron didn't have quite the same reaction.

""The what?"" they asked.

Draco rolled his eyes at them.

""Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look - read that, there.""

She pushed the books toward them, and Harry and Ron read:




The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.



There have been many reports of the Philosopher's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).


""See?"" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. ""The dog must be guarding Flamel's Philosopher's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!""

""A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!"" said Harry. ""No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.""

""And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,"" said Ron. ""He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?""

""It still feels like we're missing something, though,"" Draco murmured. ""Like there's something more Snape's planning.""



Harry only remembered about Snape and the coming match the next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts class. He told Ron, Draco, and Hermione that he was going to play, but as the match drew nearer, he grew more and more nervous, no matter what he told his friends. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. Harry wasn't sure they'd be allowed to overtake Slytherin in the House Championship, no matter how wonderful that idea was, not with such a biased referee.

Harry wasn't sure if he was imagining it or not, but he kept running into Snape wherever he went. It was like he was following him, trying to catch him alone. It was worse in Potions, and if it weren't for the calm reassurances from Draco, Harry would have thought that Snape knew they'd found out about the Philosopher's Stone. He didn't mention it to the other boy, but he had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.



Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that his friends were wondering if they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly head a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Ron, Hermione, and Draco, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had all brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that the three of them had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Nott using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.

""Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,"" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.

""I know,"" Ron snapped. ""Don't nag.""

""Hush both of you, I'm trying to concentrate,"" Draco hissed, eyes glued to the pitch.

Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.

""Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch, it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much. Diggory's a good Seeker, but no match for you as far as flying.""

""The whole school's out there!"" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. ""Even - blimey - Dumbledore's come to watch!""

Harry's heart did a little somersault.

""Dumbledore?"" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard, or the seafoam green robes.

Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.

Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.

""I've never seen Snape look so mean,"" he told Hermione and Draco.

""You've never seen him yell at a house elf,"" Draco muttered. Hermione looked confused and opened her mouth to say something, but Ron interrupted her by exclaiming in pain.

Someone had knocked Ron in the back of the head. It was Zabini, flanked by a smirking Parkinson and Nott, who were further flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

""Oh, sorry, Weasley, we didn't see you there.""

Zabini grinned broadly at Nott and Parkinson.

""Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?"" Parkinson mused. ""Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley? Not that you have any money for it.""

Ron didn't answer, if only because of Draco's restraining hand; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.

""I think they just choose people for the Gryffindor team that they feel sorry for,"" said Nott loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. ""Potter's got no parents and the Weasley's have got no money - you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.""

Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Nott.

""I'm worth twelve of you, Nott,"" he stammered.

The Slytherins howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the fame, said, ""You tell him, Neville.""

""Longbottom, if brains were gold, you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something,"" said Zabini.

""We can't all have nifflers for mothers, Blaise,"" Draco sneered, ""we'd run out of fortunes to steal.""

""What's that supposed to mean?"" Zabini demanded, standing from his seat and glowering at the Gryffindors.

Draco carefully and slowly turned in his seat, casually looking up at the flustered boy, and smirked. ""Just hoping nothing happens to your mother's newest husband, there aren't too many wealthy bachelors left in Wizarding England. Though I hear eighth time's the charm.""

""Draco!"" said Hermione suddenly, ""Harry -!""

Draco snapped his head around just in time to watch Harry go into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.

""You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!"" said Parkinson.

""Oh, maybe it'll be enough for Blaise's mum to consider marrying him next,"" Draco retorted.

It was enough to settle Ron, but Zabini took offense. Before Draco knew what was happening, Zabini was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Ron didn't hesitate before slamming into Nott, though Neville took a moment before clambering over the back of his seat to help. Pansy was wise enough to take a step back to avoid the scuffle.

""Come on, Harry!"" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape - she didn't even notice Draco, Zabini, Ron, and Nott rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.

Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches - the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.

The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.

""Ron! Draco! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!"" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.

Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it - the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped - then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.

""Well done,"" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. ""Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...""

Snape spat bitterly on the ground.



Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now - no one could ever say he was just a famous name anymore. The evening air had never smelt so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; his friends in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed and Draco grinning at him despite the bruise rapidly forming on his cheek.

Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape...

And speaking of Snape...

Harry watched as the hooded figure swiftly made its way down the steps and across the grounds toward the forbidden forest. Harry, recognizing the figure's prowling walk as Snape's and wondering what he was up to, quickly mounted his broom and followed him silently into the forest. He couldn't see where Snape had gone at first, but as he carefully flew lower and lower over the forest he caught the sound of voices and flew closer, landing noiselessly in a towering beech tree.

Harry had to strain his ears, but as he listened to Snape and Quirrell talk below him, he liked what they were saying less and less.

Quirrell was still standing in the clearing, quite still as though he was petrified, when Harry left.



""Harry where have you been?"" Hermione squeaked.

""Congratulations, Harry!"" Draco beamed, wincing as he aggravated his bruise, but looking no less chipper.

""We won! We won! We won!"" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. ""And I gave Nott a black eye, and Draco cracked one of Zabini's teeth, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.""

""Never mind that now,"" said Harry breathlessly. ""Let's find an empty room, you wait until you hear this...""

He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind him, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.

""So we were right, it is the Philosopher's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus-pocus' - I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantment, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -""

""So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?"" said Hermione in alarm.

""It'll be gone by next Tuesday,"" said Ron. Draco nodded solemnly in agreement.

Hope y'all liked the changes I've made! I also decided to introduce Theodore Nott into the story as part of the Slytherin trio (not counting Crabbe and Goyle). I also made the executive decision to call it the Philosopher's Stone instead of the Sorcerer's Stone despite me being American because it just sounds better. I honestly don't get why they had to change the name in America, that's just so stupid.

Anywho, hope y'all enjoyed! Sorry for being absent, but I figure y'all are used to it by now -_-"

This, in and of itself, would be odd enough, since the lilac kitten was about all that ensured Harry was out of bed before noon. Nonetheless, before the sun had even made an attempt to properly break over the horizon, there was a knock at Harry's door.

Harry would confess to being a light sleeper these days, and admittedly he doesn't get many visitors that aren't the same people he's been seeing for the past 15 years. And there's only a handful of people (if you consider the entire surviving Weasley family only part of a handful) that know the actual location of his flat in muggle London. It was probably just Hermione wanting to have breakfast with him before she headed to work, or Ron wanting to take him down to Holyhead to watch Ginny practice. There wasn't any danger lurking on the other side of his front door. Just a friend looking to get him out of the house.

There wasn't any reason to be afraid.

Despite those entirely rational thoughts that rolled through Harry's head, he couldn't seem to loosen his grip on the edge of his bedsheets as he frantically tried to grab for his wand and his glasses, stashed in two separate locations, with the same hand. He ended up knocking his actual alarm clock onto the hardwood floor, and the noise startled him enough that he froze and tried to hear past the silence of his bedroom and over the blood that rushed through his ears.

The knock continued, haltingly and at an awkward tempo. It paused, then resumed again almost timidly, as if apologetic for its former frantic tone.

Harry swallowed past the toad-sized lump in his throat, and attempted the 'Take a deep breath, Harry, steady your hands, Harry, you'll be alright, Harry, you're not alone, Harry' that Hermione had impressed upon him. Except he was alone, besides whoever had just woken him up at the ass-end of dawn.

Harry's inner diatribe was cut short as the knocking continued and gold eyes squinted at him accusingly from the catbed pressed up against the wall underneath his bedroom window. Ron said it was weird that Harry and his cat liked to stare at each other from their respective beds. Hermione said it was sweet that they'd become such great companions, and formed such a comfortable bond so quickly. Harry just liked knowing that there was another living being with him in the dark.

The kitten chirped questioningly. 'Well? Are you going to answer  that or not?', the look seemed to say. It should be noted that Harry could not actually speak cat. It should also be noted that Harry wasn't aware, before he owned a kitten of his own, that cats were capable of having different looks. He is now very aware of this feline ability, especially since it was being presented at that very moment.

""Yes, yes, I'm going,"" Harry responded, voice still rough from sleep. Mostly to the cat, but also to somewhat to himself because even Harry thought it was just a tad bit barmy to hold full conversations with a small ball of sentient fluff. He grabbed his wand from under his pillow, this time with no alarm clock casualties, and finally put on his glasses. In his peripheral, Harry saw the kitten's glare become even more disdainful, and she stood with a huff (could cats even huff?). She had apparently deemed that he was taking too long, even though the knocking had only begun maybe one, possibly two minutes ago.

She walked to the doorway of his room, and looked back at him as if to say 'I'm up now, and I say we're going to answer this door. Stop your dallying, and let's get a move on.' She trotted through the living room, head as high and haughty as a cat's could be (which is, of course, very). Harry followed obediently.

She plopped, or perhaps an attempt at something more elegantly than a plop, down in front of the door. Her fuzzy tail swished slowly, and she looked up at him expectantly. 'I'm just here for moral support'

Wand gripped tight in hand, Harry called out ""Who is it?"" through the door, and received an approving 'Mraow' from somewhere near his right foot when his voice only shook marginally.

""It's Neville, Harry. May I come in?""

Harry slid the chain out, turned the deadbolt, unlocked the knob, and opened the door.

""Neville, is something wrong?"" Harry said, stepping to the side so Neville could come in. Harry frowned, taking in Neville's harried appearance in the dim lighting - his hair was standing in approximately 4 different directions, and his clothes were horribly rumpled. Neville wasn't known for looking necessarily well put together, but he also wasn't known for showing up on Harry's doorstep before dawn.

""Yes, I mean, no, I mean -"" Neville sidestepped Harry, and Harry figured the the only reason Neville wasn't wringing his hands, or ripping out large quantities of his hair, was that his hands were occupied by an inconspicuous wooden box, about the size of a large textbook.

When he was finally inside, and Harry's front door was closed and re-locked, Neville thrusted the box forward, and Harry was able to read the top which read ""DEAR HARRY & NEVILLE"" in large block letters. Harry took a step back, unconsciously placing more space between himself and whatever it was about the box that had Neville so... extra Neville-looking.

 ""I found this,"" Neville said, in an approximation of level voice.

 ""You...found it? Where did you find it, Neville?"" Out of the corner of his eye, Harry just barely saw a tiny gray tail leave the room, obviously uninterested with the grungy looking newcomer.

 ""I was going through some of my parents old things, and I found this,"" he thrusted the box forward again, his eyes went a bit frantic. This time Harry reached out to grab Neville's hands, which he found trembled slightly from holding the box so tightly. ""I found this, Harry, and it has our names on it, and I wanted to open it with you, and Merlin, I don't even know what time it is but I found this box - ""

 Harry felt several steps behind wherever Neville's thoughts were, and led his friend over to the brown leather couch Ginny had picked out for his flat, while Neville continued a stream of consciousness speech about The Box. Harry was frankly surprised he hadn't run out air yet. He guided (pushed) Neville into sitting, and interrupted him before he could actually talk until he was blue in the face.

 ""Neville,"" Harry said firmly, placing his hands on Neville's shoulders. He forced the taller man to look up from The Box, and into Harry's eyes. ""You found a box.""

 Neville nodded slowly, and his eyes widened again. Harry felt Neville's shoulders tense as he, improbably, gripped the box even tighter.

 ""Our names are on it, Harry. And it was with my parents' things. Harry, I'm..."" Neville's sentence trailed off, and his head hung limply between his shoulders as he stared at the box. Harry let go of his shoulders, and thought about what Neville was trying to say.

 He'd found a box. With his parents' things. And it had their names on it. Harry's mind roiled over the three sentences Neville had practically been chanting since he'd walked in the door.

 ""Neville, do you think that box belonged to our parents? That it's for us?"" Harry placed a hand over one of Neville's which were once again shaking.

 The room was still too dark for Harry to properly see Neville's face. His entire body seemed to be shrouded in shadows from every direction. Harry reached over the arm of the couch and flicked on the lap, and for a second wished he hadn't - it was like trading one set of shadows for another.

 Neville's skin was sallow and pale, and his bloodshot eyes were watery with unshed tears. The hunch in his shoulders and his deep slouch gave off the immediate impression that Neville was a man on his last legs.

 ""Neville, are you alright?"" Harry watched Neville's face fall even more, if that was at all possible. His bottom lip trembled, and the soft glow of the lamp played on the shadows of his face. Harry himself certainly did not feel okay.

 ""I couldn't sleep,"" he said quietly. Neville brushed his fingertips lightly over the cover of the box, and as he traced the letters of their names almost reverently, it started to truly sink in for Harry what Neville had just brought through his front door.

 ""I couldn't sleep, so I was going through my parents' old things. Gran never went through it all; I just figured it was too tough for her all these years, rummaging through all their stuff like they're not here anymore."" Neville paused, as if he was waiting for Harry to interrupt him again; Harry didn't. When he started up again, his voice was soft and sad. ""Most of it was just old documents, papers. Gran already had most of the important stuff. But then I found this box, Harry, and I just had to come right over.""

 Harry had the strangest thought that perhaps Trevor had taken up residence in his vocal cords, because he was once again swallowing past a lump in his throat. Harry imagined this was exactly what Neville had been looking for - some hidden gem under a pile of old papers that would completely change everything. But what was one supposed to do when they actually found it?

 ""Well I suppose we should open it, don't you think?"" Harry didn't actually know at all what to do in this situation, but sometimes his life required that he pretend.

 ""But what if...,"" Neville's sentence trailed off, and when he looked up, Harry thought that he hadn't seen him look so lost since they were taking classes at Hogwarts together. ""What if just makes everything worse? How could it possibly make anything better, Harry? My parents are never going to leave St. Mungo's, and your parents are never coming back. How could whatever's in this box make that feel any easier?""

 Harry cleared his throat, damned Trevor and his apparating, and tried once again to look like had had any idea what he was doing. The war had taken too much from all of them, but it had also helped Neville grow into the person he needed to be. In the very end, when they had almost nothing left to fight with, Neville had hope. It had filled him when Voldemort had expected them all to be empty, and in turn it inspired those around him to keep fighting.

 And now Neville had come to him with this box with their names on it, except he was truly empty this time. There wasn't any of the hope left. Just the afterimages of everything that had been lost to the war, and the hollow space where their parents should have been. He looked as if the entire weight of the world was balanced precariously on his shoulders, and Harry so desperately wanted to lighten his burden.

 ""I don't sleep much anymore either,"" Harry said. There was no preamble, and Neville looked startled at the confession. ""I go on a lot of walks. It's how I found my cat."" Harry pointed off to Neville's side, where the kitten was sitting across from them, staring curiously. ""Her name's Winston.""

 ""Hi, Winston."" Neville waved slowly at the kitten, who gave a small 'mraow' in response.

 ""Most nights I used to just lay in bed and stare at the wall. But ever since I found her, she stays up with me, and I feel a little better. Sometimes."" Neville had remained silent while Harry was speaking, but had moved closer to him on the couch until their knees were touching. ""Other times I feel like I'll just collapse into nothing in the dark, and then I have to do like you, I guess. Get up and do something.""

 As if sensing the mood shift, Winston came over and tapped harry on the ankle chirping out a  request to be picked up. Harry obliged, and she situated herself comfortably in the small dip where Harry and Neville's knees met, curled a ball.

 ""It wasn't fair, what happened to us."" Neville ran a fingertip down Winston's back while he talked, the box balanced in his lap. He gained a rumbling purr for his attentions. ""It wasn't fair what happened to anyone during the war. If anyone understands that it's you and I, Harry. But...""

 ""Neville - "" Harry began, but he was cut off before he could offer any words of comfort.

 ""Sometimes I wish I could they could have been selfish."" Neville looked up now, as color blotted back into his face. His cheeks flamed a ruddy blush, and his lips were pursed before he went on. ""I wish they could have just run away from it all, and let someone else handle it. I wish we could have done that too. Why couldn't someone else have saved the bloody world, Harry? Why did it have be us?""

 Neville's voice was high and panicky as his eyes searched Harry's for answers. Harry thought he hadn't felt this helpless since he'd had to watch friends and those he loved die around him, without anything he could do to save them. It was definitely a familiar feeling to him, watching a horrible thing happen in front of you, and having no idea how to stop it, fix it, or make it better.

 ""You don't wish that, Neville. Not really."" Harry shook his head, partly in disbelief and partly in distress. He reached for Neville's shoulder, but stopped his hand halfway and pulled it back.

 ""But I want to mean it, Harry. Wouldn't it have been easier? I know you, Harry. I know you never wanted to be The Chosen One or The Boy Who Lived,"" Neville said, leaning forward while he spoke until their shoulders almost touched. Winston voiced her displeasure at being jostled, and batted at the box still in Neville's lap with a paw as its contents slid around inside. Neville's breath was coming fast, and his cheeks darkened even more. ""Maybe I wish I wasn't a hero too.""

 ""Neville."" Harry's voice was imploring, trying to get Neville to see a light at the end of the tunnel that Harry couldn't even see for himself most days. Neville shook his head in reply, as if he was attempting to actually shake off Harry's words.

""No, no, you don't understand, - "" he began, but he was interrupted by his own tears, and, dear Merlin, Harry was really going to die of grief for Neville bloody Longbottom in his own damned livingroom. ""I wish, I wish -""

 ""Oh, Neville,"" Harry whispered, and grabbed the man's ruddy cheeks in his hands. They were slippery with tears, and Harry thought it was a good analogy, since at that particular moment it felt like the entire world was slipping through his fingers, one survivor at a time. ""You're a hero because you're you, Neville. Not the other way around.""

 Harry's throat felt like he was choking on glass, but he kept forcing the words out. This felt like the most important Hero's Speech he'd ever made, and he'd be damned if he let Neville leave his flat still feeling this way.

 ""You're a hero because despite all the hurt and pain, you didn't run away. You chose to save the world instead. And so did they, Neville. And we are so bloody proud of them for it. They were heroes, and they'd be damned proud of us for being heroes too.""

 Harry felt rather than saw the tension bleed out of Neville, and he heard a gentle 'tap-tap' as he closed his eyes and let his tears fall on the top of the box. Neville placed his hands on top of Harry's where they still rested on his cheeks, and he huffed out a breath.

 Harry leaned his body forward until his forehead touched Neville's, and he rubbed the scruff of his hair against Neville's. ""You're a good man, Neville,"" he said, and he closed his own eyes when the combined heat of their breaths fogged up his glassed. ""You're a damned good man, and I'm damned proud of you, too""

 He felt like he could have sat there forever, trying to send every big of positivity he struggled to find on a daily basis into Neville through this small bit of contact they had. But the moment was cut short when they were startled apart by the clatter of The Box sliding off Neville's lap and crashing to the ground. Winston voiced her displeasure at being disturbed from her spot on their knees, and peered over the edge of the couch where the box laid on its' side, and its contents splayed across the hardwood floor.

 Neville released Harry's hand, and Harry went to do the same to Neville, but not before wiping off the man's cheeks with the sleeve of his jumper.

 They stared at Harry's floor, where a few photographs and a thick, plastic rectangle laid scattered. Neville bent down to pick them up, and Winston took this as her opportunity to jump down from the couch and climb into the overturned box.

 Neville situated the photos in his hands until they were all rightside up, and facing the right way; there were three in total. Harry shifted down the couch so that he was no longer facing Neville, but that they were pressed together from shoulder to thigh. They peered down at the photographs together.

 The first was a picture of Harry and Neville, predictably enough. They were facing each other, tiny toddler shoulders shaking with laughter, with Harry's chubby baby hands smushing Neville's full cheeks together until his face was almost unrecognizable. Neville's hands pressed over Harry's own, and distended his mouth further. It was an eerie, if not entirely innocent replica of the comfort they had just shared, even though the picture had to have been take over 20 years ago.

 ""What is your utter obsession with my cheeks, mate?"" Neville chuckled, looking sidelong at Harry, who had the decency to look indignant.

 ""Well it's not my fault they're the focal point of your face,"" Harry said. He grabbed the photo from Neville's hand, and couldn't stop the smile that spread over his face in response to Neville's own. It was nice to see Neville smiling.

 Harry's smile grew even wider when he looked at the next photo Neville was holding.

 It was all four of their parents, clothes mussed and hair a mess, standing in front of a banner that said ""Happy 1st Birthday Harry & Neville"". They were grinning from ear to ear, and the photo captured James and Frank looking at each other conspiratorially before grabbing their respective wives and kissing them messily on the cheek. Harry and Neville saw their mothers screech in disgust and bat their husbands away, and then the photo reset and began all over again.

 Harry didn't feel the embarrassment that most young adults did at seeing their parents display affection. He feel like he was seeing some of the strongest people he knew (or if you wanted to get grief-stricken about it, didn't know) share one of the last happy moments of their lives.

 Neville sniffed precariously, and rubbed his eyes with one hand and handed the photo to Harry with the other. The final photo lay in his lap, and Harry let out a soft, ""Oh, Neville,"" for the second time that morning.

 It was all six of them, Harry being held by his parents, and Neville by his, standing in front of the birthday banner. Harry and Neville were waving, and Alice and Lily were pressed shoulder to shoulder so they would all fit in the photograph. They were all smiling, and they looked as if no evil in the world could ever steal the happiness they'd found. For a brief moment, Harry felt cheated, because he knew the ending to the story, and it wasn't a happy one.

 And yet...

 He looked over at Neville, whose eyes were lit up as if they were filled with every star in the sky, staring in complete awe at the photograph. And he realized that this was actually exactly how his parents would have liked this story to end. He patted Neville on the shoulder lightly when he took in a watery series of breaths.

 ""They look so happy, Harry. I don't know if I've ever seen them look this happy. It's wonderful, isn't it? Look how wonderful it is!"" Neville's voice had taken on a wistful tone, and he held the photograph up so it was just inches from Harry's face. Harry couldn't help but laugh, deep and down from his belly, and nod along with Neville's enthusiasm.

 ""It's wonderful, Neville,"" he said, and covered Neville's hands with his own, so that he could press Neville's arms back to his sides and lower the photograph from his face. When he could see again, Harry saw him curl around behind himself and grab the black rectangle that had follow out with the photographs.

 ""And look! There's this! It's a...,"" Neville turned the rectangle in his hands, inspecting its sides. ""I have no idea what this is.""

 Harry's eyes caught on the logo branded on the front, and almost instantly recognized it.

 ""It's a Walkman! Blimey, these things are ancient..."" He held his hand out, and Neville handed it to him, eyes asking what the hell a Walkman was. Harry answered before he could get the question out. ""It can play music, but also record stuff and then play it back."" He flipped it over and saw that there was indeed a cassette tape inside. He figured his mom, the only Muggleborn in the bunch, was probably the one who had originally owned it and modified it for magical use.

 Harry pressed what looked to be the play button, and the tape crackled to life, sound pouring out of a speaker that had to have been magically created inside of the music player.

 There was a soft ""tap-tap-tap"" against the microphone, and then:

 


""Testing, testing, this is James Potter, recording live from the Potter living room, where I am joined by my exhausted compatriots on the evening of August 1st, after a long day of wrangling 1 year olds.""


 


""Wrangling, James? You make our children sound like hippogriffs!""


 


""Well, Lily, I can't help it if they act beastly.""


 


""Beastly?! The only thing beastly here is you, James, you absolute codger! 'Oh, my back. Lily, grab Harry, he's on the broomstick again, I need to catch my breath!' Honestly if I wasn't your wife, I'd laugh at you. Actually, I think I will anyway.""


 


""Do you hear how my wife talks to me, Frank? The injustice of it all, I tell you. Where is the respect? The dignity?!""


 


""Probably in the rubbish bin with all the diapers we've changed.""


 


""Now that you mention it, Frank, go check on them, would you? And Alice, it's your turn to pull double duty. Damn my pride, I might literally faint if I have to change another of those boys' nappies.""


 


""The absolute bloody hell it is! Besides being an absolute carbon copy of you, James, that boy takes man-sized shites.""


 


""Alice! The mouth on you since the boys were born! I thought you'd said you were going to try and stop?""


 


""Oh, bollocks to that, Lily. They're sleeping, aren't they? I try, honestly I do, but my mum raised me have a full and varied vocabulary like a good, worldly witch. And that includes a good swear every now and again. And it's not like Frank is much help. Is't that right, Frank?""


 


""I'm afraid I don't know what you mean, darling, I am the pinnacle of virtuosity and sainthood. And speaking of saints, our little angels are resting comfortably after performing their best hellion routine all afternoon.""


 


""Oh, we should take a picture before they wake up! I bet they look so precious. If there's one thing we did correctly, it's make the most wonderful little babies. Even if mine looks nothing like me.""


 


""Now, now, Lily. He might have gotten my flowing ebony locks that blow gracefully in the autumn breeze -""


 


""Bugger me, here we go...""


 


"" - My golden copper skin that shines in the afternoon sun as if was was enchanted by Merlin himself -""


 


""This is the man you chose to marry, Lily darling. My dear mother could find you a replacement, just say the word.""


 


"" - And my dashing good looks, descended from the Indian courtesans of old, as well baring part of my name, strong and firm - but at least he has your eyes, my darling.""


 


""Oh, is that where you were going with that? Took you long enough.""


 


""You cannot begrudge a poet for the time it takes him to spin the web of his words.""


 


""Except you're not a poet, and I can begrudge you until I'm blue in the face.""


 


""Aren't they adorable, Frank? I think my teeth are rotting from how adorable they are.""


 


""Adorable would indeed be an apt word to describe them. And to think, just one year ago today, adorable James Potter was bawling, seeing his son for the first time.""


 

""Oi! I wasn't bawling, it was more like a mild sob.""

 


""You were bawling, dear.""


 


""Well how couldn't I! He came out, and screamed himself pink in the face and... It felt like my heart was breaking into a million damn pieces. And when he opened his eyes, and it was like I was looking into a mirror of yours...""


 


""James Potter: Teary Father. I never thought I'd see the day, Frank. Can you believe it? If someone had told me 5 years ago that James Potter would have tears in his eyes, talking about his newborn son, I'd've laughed in their face and told them they were taking the piss.""


 


""I can hardly believe it myself, Alice.""


 


""You're telling me! I never thought I'd be the settling down type. Domesticity seemed so bland. But Merlin, when that boy smiles at me, it's like I'm being knocked off my damn feet.""


 


""It's like nothing I've ever felt before, loving that boy... I get up in the morning, and I want to dedicate my every waking moment to him. The diapers, the late night feedings, the crying - none of it compares to the look in his eyes when he first wakes up in the morning.""


 


""I really thought I had it all figured out, Lily. I thought I knew the world as far as it could go. But our little Harry... I fall apart everytime I look at him.""


 


""Oh, Frank, they're making me cry! Stop it, you two, I'm an auror! I'll arrest you for this!""


 


""Alice, I seem to remember quite clearly just the other day when you waxed poetic about how 'pride did not sufficiently describe the feelings that motherhood had awoken in you' and how 'Neville's soul shined brighter than the sun'.""


 


""Frank! Whose side are you on, here?!""


 


""There are no sides, dear, only love. Sentimentality is an unfortunate byproduct of parenthood, I'm afraid. We must live and let live, darling.""


 


""Is that your 'Dad Voice', Frank? If anyone's a codger here, it's you. You sound like Dumbledore with all that 'live and let live' talk.""


 


""To be honest, I'm kind of making it up as I go along. It's not like I know what a Dad sounds like behind closed doors.""


 


""Oh, Frank...""


 


""No, Lily, it's quite alright - my mother did better by me than that man ever could have. He wasn't around, and it still burns like a damn Stinging Hex. But I can be there for Neville. Doesn't matter how many mistakes I make, I'll be around for that little boy.""


 


""Frank - ""


 

""No, he's right, Alice. We have to be around for them. There's no other option in this. Our jobs are to make the wizarding world a safe place for them, so they can grow up and never have to bleed and fight the way we had to. That's what we have to do, Lily!""

 


""I know, James, but - ""


 


""If we can just win this war, if we can can set the foundation, something for them to build on, something to pass on - ""


 


""I want nothing more in the world, James, but - ""


 

""No buts, Lily! I can't bear the thought of any world except the one where the four of us raise our sons, and get to see them grow up and change the world! He could be the Minister of Magic, one day! He could be anything he damn well pleases, and I'm gonna see it happen. No buts.""

 


""They'll blow the whole bloody world away, is what they'll do. There's bugger all that could keep me from watching that.""


 


""...Yeah. Bugger all! Bugger all is gonna keep us from them. I'll do whatever it takes...""


 


""Bugger all, she says! Blimey, I'm a mess. Get me a tissue, Frank, I'm sopping.""


 


""Yes, dear.""


 


""I love you, you utter git.""


 


""I love you too, my redheaded beauty.""


 


""Frank, my tissues! I'm leaking all over the gaff!""


 


""Coming, dear.""


 

The tape clicked, signalling the end of the recording. Winston poked her head out of her new playbox, and cocked her tiny head at the sight of the two wizards, staring blankly at the Walkman. Deeming it wholly uninteresting, she crawled back inside.

 ""Those were our parents,"" Neville said quietly. ""Those...those were our parents.""

 Harry realized, suddenly, that Neville had never heard his parents converse with lucidity. And Harry had only only seen his parents as memories and apparitions in death. He was torn a little between sobbing uncontrollably, and framing the recorder so that he could pull it out and listen to it as many times as he wanted. For the time being, he just settled on saying:

 ""Your mum cursed like a barman."" Neville hooted in response, and Harry felt the somberness of his mood fade away.

 ""She did! She did, didn't she? She did, she did, she did!"" Neville jumped from his seat on the couch, and pumped both his fists above his head. He was a far cry from the broken man that had come through Harry's front door some time ago. His arms dropped, forearms resting crossed on the top of his head, and the peace on his face made some warm, happy place in Harry's chest bloom in fondness.

 Neville's rumpled jumper had slid up his stomach just the tiniest bit when he'd put his arms above his head, and there was a small stripe of pale skin visible where his shirt and pants no longer met. He looked like the carefree young man that they'd never had the chance to be, and Harry thought 'Yes, of course, this is what a happy ending looks like. Why couldn't I see it before?'

 ""They loved us so bloody much, Harry. And they would have given anything to have been here for us. But their sacrifices helped save the world, just like ours did, and - "" Neville tilted his head back, and uncrossed his arms until his hands were grabbing his hair, and his face was hidden in the crooks of his elbows. His voice was muffled when he continued, saying ""It's hard to see it sometimes, when I go visit them, and I always feel so damned guilty. But, Merlin, I love them so much I could just burst, Harry. I could burst!""

 He thrusted his arms above his head again, as if he was on the most exciting part of a rollercoaster, and was enjoying every second of the ride. Harry knew exactly how he felt, just looking at the joy on Neville's face. Suddenly compelled, he stood, and before he could regret it, he hugged Neville. His arms were around the taller man's waist, and his face only came up to his chest, but he squeezed, and tried to say the words 'I get it, I get it, it feels so goddamned good, and I get it' through touch alone. Neville's arms came up around his back, and returned the hug.

 'I know, isn't it wonderful?' his hug seemed to say.

 It was.

 Harry pulled back, after ""inconspicuously"" wiping under his glasses, and chuckled lightly. This was not how he expected his morning to go.

 ""Well that was something,"" he said jokingly. When Neville smiled back at him, Harry's heart felt a full in the places that had felt vacant before. ""And I'll tell you one thing, I am famished. What do you say to a proper muggle London breakfast, Neville?""

 Before Neville could respond, his stomach answered for him, gurgling loudly and signalling its desire for any breakfast, proper or not. Neville rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, and patted his belly.

 ""I'll take that as a yes.""

 From inside the overturned box, Winston mewed, and decided she was ready to be apart of the conversation. Neville leaned down to pick her up, then cradled her to his chest. Harry had the strangest thought that she'd probably never been up that high before. Could cats get vertigo?

 ""Why don't you spend some quality time with Winston and pack up our parents' things while I go put on some pants suitable for outside?""

 Neville was too busy cooing at a purring Winston to respond. Harry shook his head and retreated to his bedroom to get changed and look somewhat presentable. When he returned, the box was packed and on his coffee table, and Neville was waiting at the door. He'd commandeered a small, white cloth basket that Ginny had bought and called a 'knick-knack basket', and placed Winston inside. She seemed prepared to come along for their outing.

 ""All set?"" Neville looked up from the kitten, and met Harry's eyes.

 ""Yes, but you're forgetting the box."" Harry pointed to the coffee table where it remained, sitting closed and full of some of the most beautiful memories Harry had ever seen or heard.

 ""Oh, I thought I'd just leave it here. And maybe I could visit when I want to give it a listen? If...if that's okay?"" Neville's hands wrung around the hands of the basket, belaying his nervousness.

 ""That sounds perfect, Neville. I could use some more company of the human kind."" He walked over to join Neville at the front door, and grabbed his keys from the keyrack next to it. ""Winston here is a delight, but kitten conversations only go so far."" She mewled, affronted at the disparagement comments toward her conversation skills. Harry appeased her by scratching the underside of her chin, just the way she liked it. Winston accepted his apology.

 Neville laughed, a full body laugh that shook his shoulders, and lit up his face, and took years of weight off of his shoulders. He looked happy.

 ""Well then, let's head out!"" He stepped to the side so that Harry could unlock the door, and swooped one hand outward as if he were a knight making way for a fair maiden. Harry shook his head, snorting at Neville's antics, and let them all outside.

 As he turned to lock the door, he saw the sunrise peeking over the horizon from his bedroom window, bathing his entire flat in an orange hue. He closed the door, locked it, and turned around to Neville to comment on how the weather was actually allowing for sun today.

 To his surprise, the soft smile on Neville's face as he waggled a finger at Winston inside her basket felt just as rewarding as seeing the sun after spending what felt like months in the darkness.

 Neville caught him staring, and raised an eyebrow in question.

 ""Nothing, nothing. Let's get a move on, shall we?""

 They headed down the hallway, and down the stairs, shoulders brushing. The silence between them was comfortable, and was broken only occasionally by Winston's mewing.

 'Yes,' Harry thought, 'This is what a happy ending feels like.'"

She opens the door to find the cutest little boy, with the chubbiest cheeks and the longest eyelashes she's ever seen, holding out a tray of little white dumplings. He's got bright green eyes which she could swear were familiar, but they practically disappear when he smiles, eyes scrunching up.

""Hello!"" He says, sounding like this is the best thing that's ever happened to him. He's practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. ""App- err, my dad said I should bring some sweets over. 'Cause we're neighbors. I told him to make cookies, but these are good, I promise!""

""Hari, I told you not to-"" There's a tall, black haired man running up her driveway, who looks more or less exactly like the boy in front of her, and he smiles sheepishly when she gives him a once over. ""Sorry about my son, he gets a little excited about meeting new people."" The man holds his hand out, and Lily shakes it. ""I'm James Potter. And don't worry, the food's safe.""

""I'm Lily Evans."" She says, taking one of the dumplings off the tray and popping it in her mouth. They taste of coconut and sugar, and they're really quite good. ""Have you got a recipe for those?""

""Sure thing, neighbor."" James says, with a wink. ""Sorry, still. Must've given you a scare. We'll be off, now- little tyke's got homework he's avoiding. Thanks for the chat!""

""No problem. See you two around."" She says, and shuts the door once the boys have run across the driveway and into their yard.

Who knew? Having neighbors might actually be fun.

""Hari, evlo tharava solliruken..."" James rubs his forehead. That was a disaster. He's thankful the neighbor didn't get mad at them. (Hari, how many times have I told you...)

""Sorry, Appa."" Harry says, looking quite repentant. James has had this child long enough to know that that's utter crap, so he waits for something a little more sincere. ""Inime pannamaatten, Appa."" (I won't do it anymore, Daddy.)

""Good."" James nods sharply, reaching out to ruffle Harry's hair. Harry comes to life, knowing that he's forgiven, and launches himself at James, hugging his father's leg as tightly as he can. ""Ennadaa ithu..."" (Don't do me like that, bro.)

""Fine, fine."" Harry steps back, arms crossed and pouting, and James has to give in. He scoops his son up off the ground, hugging him as tightly as possible, and Harry squirms to get free.

""Appa, I'm gonna be in big kid school soon!"" Harry complains, wiggling as hard as he can. He's no match for James' arms, though, so he eventually gives up, laying his head on his father's shoulder. ""Are you hugging me extra for Amma?""

""Yeah."" James says, nodding, before he plants a kiss on the top of Harry's head and sets him down. Harry immediately runs for the still nearly full tray of kozhakattai, eagerly popping one into his mouth. James smiles, shaking his head. Harry's always had a sweet tooth, and he should've known better to make his son's favorite sweet and then tell him to give them to other people. The familiar ache in his heart starts up, though, at the mention of her, and it's a little hard to set aside, even with his son's smile lighting up the room. Harry doesn't talk about her much, anymore, and James wonders if he's forgetting.

""Appa?"" Harry calls out, and James realizes his son is tugging on his hand. ""Stop thinking. Your face gets all funny.""

""Okay."" James says, and ruffles Harry's hair. ""No more thinking. Promise.""

The familiar stream of five year olds hustle in, parents holding them by the straps of their backpacks and the collars of their shirts, and Lily Evans' face brightens with each new face passing through the door. All of them will grow up into tiny little people, by the time they leave this class, and most of them will be reading and writing pretty well, not to mention sharing and coloring in lines and all sorts of fancy stuff. She notices a familiar face at the door and waves as the little boy from Saturday, Harry Potter, bounds up to her.

""Hi Miss Evans!"" He says, bouncing on the balls of his feet. ""I made you a drawing!""

""That's so sweet of you, Harry."" She says, taking the piece of paper from his slightly sticky hands. There is a shark on it in blue highlighter, along with somewhere around twenty fish and a giant squid. A really, really, really large squid. ""I'll hang it up, maybe.""

""Cool!"" Harry says, just as James walks in, a folder in hand and glasses already slipping halfway down his nose. He pushes them back up as he strides up to Lily's desk, looking the very picture of confidence, and grins.

""Hello there."" He says, smiling brightly. He's quite dressed up-- must have a fancy job, then, or at least be the type of guy who liked dressing up for work. It's better than she can say for most of her male friends, who are still living out of laundry baskets. ""Take good care of my boy, yeah?"" James slaps Harry's shoulder like they're mates, and Harry grins. ""He's a smart one, but he's a little trouble.""

""He'll be no trouble at all, I bet."" She says, and James feigns sighing in relief, much to his son's annoyance. ""Go on and find your seat, Harry! I'm sure your classmates would love to meet you!""

Harry runs off to his seat, immediately chattering excitedly to the other kids at his table, and James stands there watching him, for a second. Lily knows the kind of pride that's shining in James' eyes right now, the type of pride that comes with watching something you've loved and waited and worked for come to life effortlessly, and she impulsively reaches out and pats his arm. James seems surprised, but rolls with the punch.

""You know, Mr. Potter, if you want your son to learn how to be without you, you'll have to leave first."" Lily says and James mockingly salutes her before leaving the room. The bell rings not a second after, and Lily stands up, smiling as she looks around the class. ""Hello there, kids! Who's ready for the best year of your life?""

""Me!"" Harry Potter hollers from the back of the room, loud enough to mask most of the whimpers and muttering, and Lily's smile widens just a little. 

""Appa!"" Harry yells, as soon as he spots James coming into the room, and launches himself at his father. James picks him up and hugs him tight. ""School was the best! Miss Evans is super cool, just like you said she would be!""

Lily stifles a laugh, just barely, and James looks inordinately embarrassed as he puts his son down, checking his folder for papers before rushing him out the door. He's cute, she thinks, but files the thought away. She's got thirty kids' names to learn-- there's no time to think about relationships, especially not with the father of one of them.

The next time she sees James, he's alone.

There's a knock on her door at eight in the morning, and James is standing on her doorstep, smiling just like his son does.

He's fresh from a morning run, judging by how his hair is even more messy and windswept than usual, and the sleeves of his gray hooded sweatshirt have been pushed up to reveal forearms that Lily isn't sure she can look at for long without serious health hazards. Making eye contact is an even bigger mistake-- his eyes look golden, thanks to the gray cast of the sky. He rolls his shoulders, obviously just meaning to stretch, and-- oh god, she's staring.

""So. How's it going?"" He asks, tapping his fingers against his leg. He's wearing basketball shorts. That alone should be a reason not to find him attractive. ""Harry gotten in a fight yet?""

""He's one of the sweetest kids I know."" Lily says, and she's not lying. Harry Potter has been an absolute joy to have in class for the whole week she's taught him, mainly because he has not cried once, yet. ""You're a lucky guy.""

""I am."" James nods, grinning, before his expression shifts just slightly. ""You want to come over for lunch, sometime? It's just that, uh, it doesn't look like anyone's showing up at your place often, and staying cooped up in the house too much can actually be bad for your health.""

""I'm free, as you've noticed."" Lily can't help but be a little annoyed, but it's mostly because James is, in fact, telling the truth. Her friends have all gotten busy with families and marriages these days, and she's been left swinging in the aftermath, too invested in her current friends to look for new ones. Maybe this is her opportunity to find new ones. ""When are you?""

""Harry's with some of my mates today, and I doubt he'd forgive me if I had lunch with you alone."" James says, a mischievous glint playing in his hazel eyes for a second, as if he's considering the idea. Lily wants him to, a little bit, but from what she's heard from Harry, James isn't likely to even lift a finger without his son's opinion on it first.""Tomorrow afternoon good?""

""Perfect."" She says, nodding. ""I'll be looking forward to it.""

""You've got no problems with rice, right?"" James asks, and seems relieved when she shakes her head. ""Thank God. Right. Lunch tomorrow sounds great."" His tongue darts out of his mouth just a little to wet his drying lips, and Lily would be screaming at him to do that in his own damn house, were it not for her legendary self-control.

He waves, looking a little shy for a second, before walking across to his driveway and back up to his door, closing it quietly behind him. Lily watches the door for another couple seconds, as if he'll come back out again, and then closes hers when he doesn't.

And that's when it hits her-- she's got to get through lunch with him tomorrow. Oh no.

""Hi Miss Evans!"" Harry yells, as soon as he opens the door. He's clad in blue and white striped overalls that make him look like a little train conductor, and judging by the hat he's wearing, that's exactly what he's been playing at. ""Daddy's cooking still, but he'll be here real, real, real quick!""

""That's cool."" She says, easily falling into her teacher voice. She's been around kids a lot, has always loved teaching, and she's got a nephew Harry's age. She doesn't particularly care for her nephew, all things said, but five is one of the most fun ages, in Lily's opinion. They've got so much to say, and so many things they want to talk about, that it's rather fun to get them going and watch them skip from topic to topic, bright and happy. ""What's he making?""

""My favorite!"" Harry says, running back to the door to lock it. ""Urulakizhangu!"" He notices Lily's confusion and giggles. ""Potatoes, sorry.""

""Liking veggies is really good, Harry."" Lily ruffles his hair, and Harry smiles wide. ""So, where's the table?""

Harry grabs her hand, suddenly, and drags her down the hallway. There are framed pictures on both walls, tons of them, and they're practically like a second layer of wallpaper. There are pictures of James with friends, baby pictures that could only be Harry, and-- oh. James and Harry's mum. Harry with his mother, as a baby. Lily suddenly feels like she's getting involved in something she shouldn't be, and has to crush the queasy feeling in her stomach as Harry drags her into the kitchen.

""Appa, she's here!"" Harry yells, letting go of Lily's hand to attach himself to his father's legs. ""Done yet?""

""All done."" James says. ""Move back, got to put this on the table.""

He turns around, pan full of potato chunks in hand, and smiles when he notices Lily. There's no wedding ring, that she can see, so she relaxes slightly. ""Hey."" He makes his way to the table, setting it down on a pot holder. The food smells amazing, and Lily takes her seat just as Harry sits down right opposite her. ""Sorry I wasn't free when you got in. Had a bit of a late start, today.""

""How late?"" Lily asks, as James puts a couple pieces of potato on Harry's plate before scooping rice out of the rice cooker with a wide, flat spoon. He pours something yellow on it next, from inside a pressure cooker. Some kind of lentils, she guesses, judging by the circular disks visible among the yellow, and James spoons something that looks like soup, then some melted butter on top before mixing it all together with his right hand.

Harry looks toward the cup full of spoons on the table, then Lily, looking quite guilty, and then proceeds to dig in with his hand the moment his father uses the edge of his plate to scrape any rice sticking to his hand off.

""Six?"" James asks, looking to Harry, who nods. ""Six.""

Lily stares at the assortment of vessels in front of her in confusion, and James, who had just sat back down, stands up again.

""Here."" He says with a smile, walking over to her side of the table before serving her some of the potatoes. ""I'll help.""

""Thanks."" She says, sure that she's blushing as he puts the food on her plate, and he hands her a spoon from the cup instead of mixing it like he did for Harry. ""Double thanks.""

""It's family germs with him, but I'll not be getting all up in your food."" James says, grinning. ""Your first real introduction to South Indian food, huh?""

""Guess so."" She says, and digs in.

They settle into conversation easily, and it's almost like Lily's known them for ages. James laughs at all her jokes, and Harry is the sweetest about telling her what's in everything. Lily, in turn, finds out way more about James than she ever thought possible-- he's her age (two months younger, in fact), he works as a pediatrician at the local hospital, and he's got two friends from uni who might be forming a gay motorcycle gang.

""They would be"", James says, looking entirely serious, ""but for the fact that they can't agree on a name. Now, Remus wants something sophisticated but edgy, and Sirius has got his heart set on Gayliens. They're aliens, but... you get the gist.""

""It's just the two of them in it?"" Lily asks, genuinely curious, and James groans.

""I wish."" He says, shaking his head. Harry swallows a mouthful of rice before laughing. ""They've got all of our friends in on it, but I, unfortunately, am disqualified from membership. There's a rule that says I'm banned.""

""What did you do to get banned?"" Lily asks, and Harry breaks into a fresh round of laughter, nearly falling out of his chair.

""I actually have a motorcycle license."" James says, chuckling. ""That's the bit that got them, I think. It's legal, so they're not up for it.""

""You're a pediatrician with a motorcycle license."" Lily says, disbelieving, and James nods. ""Parents must love you.""

""I don't tell them about that bit."" James says, laughing. ""If I did, I'd be a lot less popular.""

""Uncle Sirius says Appa was fun back in uni."" Harry pipes up. ""But then he had me and I was cooler than his friends. He'll tell stories, I bet!""

James immediately starts shoveling rice into his mouth to avoid any of Lily's questions.

She laughs, because it's so cute. James is practically a child himself, for all that he looks like an adult. Harry seems to be studying her, now that she's laughed, and she stops suddenly. He looks guilty, all of a sudden, like he's been found out, and she frowns.

""What's going on, Harry?"" She asks gently, and he shrugs.

""Just thinking.""

""Stop thinking. Your face goes all funny."" She says, pointing the end of her spoon at Harry before going back to her lunch, and she misses Harry and James trading a look, Harry proud and James puzzled.

The landline Lily regularly forgets she still has rings loudly, at around six thirty in the morning, and she picks up groggily. ""What?""

""Oh, sorry."" A familiar voice comes on the line, followed by the quiet, sheepish laughter that's been haunting her dreams since that lunch a month ago. That lunch was followed by more lunches, all of which were equally entertaining (Harry is quite a good singer and will perform at the drop of a hat) and frustrating (James Potter, unfortunately, seemed to only be getting hotter) by turns. ""Bad timing?""

""No, not at all."" Lily says, trying to stifle a yawn. ""I'm not going to ask where you got my phone number, because I don't think you want me to. So what's going on?""

""Harry won't be in to school today."" James says, slowly, as if he is picking and choosing his words as he speaks. ""There's a religious thing, for his mum, and we'll need to be there for the day.""

""That's nice."" Lily says. She's got no idea why she's this bothered by the thought of them leaving, even for just a short while. ""Tell his mum hello for me, then, and that his handwriting is excellent.""

""I can't, actually."" James says, the tone of his voice shifting. ""She's dead.""

""Oh."" Lily snaps to wakefulness with the abruptness of the remark. ""I'm so sorry for your loss.""

""It's been a few years. I'm alright."" He says, and Lily can tell it's more something he wants her to believe than the truth. ""Just wanted to let you know so you wouldn't worry, yeah? He might be a little difficult tomorrow, just warning ahead. He'll be fine, though, no worries.""

""Thanks, James."" She says softly. ""I'm glad you let me know. You be fine too, alright?""

""Can't make any promises, but it'd be wrong to lie to a pretty girl."" James says, sounding a little happier. ""I'll do my best.""

""See you soon, then."" Lily says, with a smile. He's called her pretty. What a nerd. ""You can come to me with anything. Really. We're friends and all, right?""

She can hear James breathing on the line, imagines the frown on his face, the way his eyebrows draw together when he is thinking and the way he worries his bottom lip between his teeth, and she is so lost in the image in her head that she nearly misses his answer.

""Yeah, Evans. We're friends."" He says, and then ends the call after a quick goodbye.

The words buzz in her chest, keeping her awake, and half an hour later, she hears a car start next door and pull out of the driveway.

Her boys, she thinks, before frowning. When did they become her boys?

They're both back on her doorstep two days later (she can tell by the way they're ringing the doorbell-- both Harry and James are competing to press it, judging by the shuffling feet and whimpers outside), and she couldn't believe how much she'd missed them. She'd seen them when James dropped Harry off, of course, and during pickup, but that wasn't really seeing a person, as far as Lily was concerned.

She opens the door, smiling at the sight of Harry, and is about to say hello when he cuts her off.

""Appa thinks you're cute and you should totally go to dinner with him and just him! Uncle Sirius'll watch me and it'll totally be cool! I promise!"" Harry blurts out, before looking to James. ""Oh. I was supposed to say hi first. Hi.""

""That's quite the proposition."" She says, looking at James, who looks like someone's punched him in the gut. ""I quite prefer a guy who doesn't need a five year old's help to ask me out, though.""

""Ooh."" Harry giggles. ""Appa got burned. Maybe that's why he said you were hot.""

""Hari."" James hisses, rubbing his forehead. ""Stop!""

""Any last words, Mr. Potter?"" Lily asks, solemnly, and James seems to get his confidence back at that.

""Yeah. Tomorrow night. My place. Just us."" James says, trying to school his face into something neutral. He's failing miserably, and Lily can tell he's the rip the bandaid off type by the way he keeps pushing forward. ""We'll talk.""

""Sounds good."" Lily says, and then something occurs to her. ""Do you want to come in?""

Harry shucks off his shoes before running through the gap between Lily's side and the door, and James pulls his off carefully, leaving them beside Harry's, before stepping into the house.

""Nice place, you've got."" He says, smiling at Lily, and she nods. Harry is around the corner, probably up to his ears in trouble, but he is out of sight, so James capitalizes on the opportunity and plants a kiss on Lily's lips before running to find his son.  Lily stands in the doorway, completely and utterly confused, but closes and locks the door before going after them.

There's no telling what they'll do, and, thankfully, she's here to stop it. 

Seeing him at school on Monday is odd, after that, because all she can think of is the fact that he'd kissed her in her doorway, and James seems to be thinking along the same lines, not making eye contact for too long, and dropping Harry off during the busiest part of the morning drop off so they wouldn't have to talk.

He waits a little longer to show up that evening, though, just long enough for Lily to deliver the kids with a longer wait for their parents to the after school program teachers, and Harry picks an abandoned section of playground to climb while James pretends holding Lily's hand doesn't make him nervous, and Lily pretends she isn't worried that someone will see them. They feel oddly like a family already, and Lily realizes why Harry's eyes looked so familiar to her that first day when she looks in the mirror that night, by accident, while brushing her teeth.

Harry's eyes look just like hers. 

Harry, according to James, has spent the last week telling all of James' friends that he's ""gotten his Appa a girlfriend and she's the bestest in the world"". Lily laughs, when she hears the news, and asks if his friends are interested in meeting the bestest in the world.

She stops in her tracks afterward, worried that she's being too forward, and relaxes when she hears him laugh, soft and easy.

""They'll love you for that."" He says, smiling wider than she ever thought possible. ""I'll figure out a day.""

""Oh, but do you?"" She asks, teasingly, poking him in the chest, and James clears his throat awkwardly, muttering something in a language she can't understand, before saying the one word she wasn't expecting.

""Yes.""

""Well, damn."" She says, after a long pause. ""That's big.""

""I'm sorry, I know I get too forward like this, I mean, this is always why people break up with me, 'cause I get way too ahead of myself and--"" James is wringing his hands, and she just wants to kiss this frustrating, weird man and she has no idea why.

""James. Shut up. I love you too."" She says, and does.

""I love you three!"" Harry yells, from the bathroom, and James pulls away to tell him to ""finish pissing, thanks"", and everything is perfect. 

""So, where's the lucky lady?"" Sirius asks, the minute he steps into the house, and then sniffs the air. ""Radish sambar, nice!""

""That'd be me."" Lily says, looking up from the reading homework she's helping Harry with. He's been mixing up letter sounds, lately, but she's more inclined to believe it's just the product of switching between languages so much. The boys don't speak English much, if at all, when she's not around, from what she understands, and it's tough for Harry to switch back and forth, especially when it comes to things like reading and writing. ""Try that bit again. I'll go talk to your Uncle Sirius.""

""Not me?"" A brown haired man in a ragged looking cardigan asks, and Lily laughs.

""Definitely not you, Remus. Definitely not you.""

""I love her."" Sirius says, awestruck. ""Can we all share her? Or is she yours or something?""

""Mine."" James says, looking to Lily for confirmation. She shrugs, and his expression brightens. ""I don't have to share, 'cause I'm good looking.""

""I look like Appa, so I don't need to share!"" Harry says, looking quite delighted, and Lily slaps a hand over her eyes. Remus seems to share her opinion, and by the end of the night, they're all talking like they're old friends.

It's a nice feeling, Lily thinks, as she goes back to her house after dinner. Warm, and comforting. Her house feels empty now, when the boys aren't in it. It's almost foreign, not having people around, and she doesn't know why.

So she calls up James, after she's sure Harry's fallen asleep, and they talk until Lily is yawning and James says ""babe, just stay over next time"" and she says ""sure, if you're okay"". James jokes about how Harry would want to sleep wherever she is, if she stayed the night, and Lily says that might not be such a bad thing, because then James would have to come along, and she falls asleep to him telling her she better enjoy cuddling, because that's practically a Potter family Olympic level sport.

""Love you"", he says softly, after he knows she's asleep. ""I mean it.""

Lily Evans snores.

The last day of school is a too warm day in July, and nearly all the kids are sweaty messes by the time the day ends. She hugs them all in turn, tells all their parents what splendid kids they are and how well they're going to do in first grade, and then it comes time for the last parent.

""So, I hear you're not his teacher anymore."" James Potter says, picking up Harry's backpack. ""That's fun.""

Harry grins, hanging tightly onto Lily's hand. ""You're much better than a teacher now.""

""I guess I am."" Lily says, with a laugh, and the next time an old lady at the supermarket tells them they're such a cute family, not one of them corrects her.

She sticks cherries on top of the cake that's meant to impress his father's business associate, humming quietly under her breath and telling Harry to go into his room like he's told. Harry grabs a piece of bread and shrugs.

""Mum?""

""Yes, Diddykins?"" She wipes her hands with her apron and ruffles his hair.

""Why can't Harry help?""

His mother clicks her tongue and caresses his cheek. ""You shouldn't worry about that, honey. Now, what do you have to do when our guests come?""

It only occurs to Dudley that she didn't answer his question when Harry drops the cake on Mrs Mason's head, a wild look on his face, his fingers like claws. Dudley's father starts screaming and Harry grows even smaller than he already is. Dudley shifts in his seat. (the letter Harry gets makes it worse)

If his mother is honey, then his father is like fire licking at their skin, warm and calming and hot in Dudley's guts (burning Harry's dark skin and the scar on his face, yelling and fleeing all across the country from letters). Dudley stares at the batter and sugar on the floor and all over his mother's good seat cushions and thinks about the Boa constrictor from a year ago.

It's Harry's birthday and no one has said a thing.

 

 

So, when his parents have gone to sleep, after bars have been put in front of Harry's window and his mother has locked the door to his room, their faces in sneers, Dudley sneaks out of his room, worrying his hands. His mother's keys hang next to the door and Dudley grabs them all, his hands sticky.

The fifth key fits into the keyhole and as he turns it he can hear the rustling of sheets. He opens the door. Harry is clutching his wand, the blanket bunched up at his feet. ""What are you doing here?"", he asks, his voice a quiet whisper and Dudley shrugs.

""I stole mum's keys"", he says and closes the door behind himself. Harry furrows his brows. The owl in the cage hoots and Dudley turns his head to look at it. It's a snow owl, fluffing its feathers and snapping its beak at him.

""What's his name?"", he asks. Harry doesn't lower his wand.

""Hedwig"", he says, his voice thick with sleep.

""She looks uncomfortable in there.""

""You think?""

Dudley worries his lower lip between his teeth and tosses the keys from one hand to another. ""I don't have a birthday present for you"", he says finally and Harry laughs. Dudley elbows him in the ribs.

""No, I mean, I just realised that I've never given you a birthday present."" He runs his hands over the keys. ""And neither have mum or dad.""

Harry says nothing.

 

 

The next morning, Dudley grabs the spare change from the jar in the kitchen and the telephone book and walks all the way to Collinson Road until he finds a phone box.

After three rings, his religion teacher picks up. ""This is Mrs Langford speaking, who's there?""

""Hi, this is, erm, Dudley Dursley.""

Silence. Dudley shifts his weight from one foot to another. ""You had me in second period on Monday this year? I'm in class with Piers Polkiss?""

""Oh!"" A laugh. ""Yes, of course, how can I help you?""

""You said last year that if we had any hypothe-"", he frowns, ""hypothetitical, no that's not it either-""

""Hypothetical questions?"" She sounds amused and Dudley nods.

""Yes that! I have one! So, say someone had -"", he hesitates, ""- abilities that could hurt people, and he went to a school studying these abilities, is it the responsible thing to do to lock him in a room?"" He thinks of Harry's thin fingers and of the owl in her cage.

Mrs Langford hums. ""How old is this hypothetical person?""

""As old as me."" He twirls the cord between his fingers.

""Well, has he ever used these abilities to willingly hurt someone?""

Dudley thinks of regrown hair and disappearing glass and Harry's head in a headlock, thinks of Piers' smug grin. ""No"", he says.

""Dudley, I don't know what this is for but please know that if there's a problem you need to tell an adult, preferably your parents.""

Dudley's father's face grows red when he screams at Harry, grabs his arms and watches him squirm and his mother's voice is rotten honey and Dudley rests his head against the glass. ""Yes"", he says. ""I will.""

""Dudley"", Mrs Langford says slowly. ""What school does your cousin go to?""

Dudley hangs up. (He has ten pounds left. Enough to buy a lock pick.)

 

 

""Happy late birthday"", he says and hands Harry a box when he sneaks into his room again. Harry hasn't drawn his wand this time.

(They let Hedwig out of the cage and Dudley runs downstairs to get Harry something to eat and Dudley feels a little less sticky when Harry smiles at him.)"

It was Halloween.


 


She and James gave Harry his first Pumpkin Pasty that morning, and he bit into it with his 3 teeth and smiled, and she looked at James, and he looked at her, and everything was a little bit perfect. 


 


Now Lily was looking into the cold, unforgiving gaze of a man who never loved. He wrapped his pale hand a little tighter around his wand and stared straight at her and she wanted to crumple up into a ball.


 


""James Potter is dead.""


 


Lily choked on a sob. James was dead. James, the sunniest, brightest, most animated person she ever knew was lying on the floor somewhere downstairs, and his warm brown eyes were now empty bits of glass in his head. James was gone now. He was twenty-one and his whole life was laid out before him, but now he was gone and could never come back. 


 


Lily thought of all the things that were going to happen. James was going to be an auror, making the world safer for everyone like he always wanted to. He was going to celebrate Deepavali with Harry, and he was going to teach Harry how to ride his first real broom. He was the one who cooked for them, and he was going to learn all her mother's recipes for her. He was going to spend every full moon for the rest of his life running with Remus, and he was going to be Sirius's brother when he needed one. He was going to be the best man at Remus and Sirius's wedding someday, if it ever became legal. He was going to bake cookies for Peter.


 


But none of that would happen. Not anymore. Because James was dead.


 


""I'm not here to kill you, Lily,"" Voldemort said, ""You do not have to die tonight. You can start a new life, be someone else. You can live, Lily."" She paused. The Death Eaters did not like to leave survivors, not when you could exterminate a whole blood-traitor family in one go. ""I am here for him."" He pointed one long, bony finger at her son, her precious boy, the best thing in the whole world as far as she could see. 


 


""No,"" Lily gasped, ""You can't take him. You can't have him. Kill me, kill me instead!"" The oddly serene look that had been on Voldemort's face morphed into one of fury. 


 


""Silly girl! Move aside!"" Voldemort pointed his wand at her and recited the incantation she knew so well from the battlefield. She saw it coming and she screamed with all the energy she had in her body. It struck her and suddenly she was falling, falling down something she couldn't see the end to.


 


There is a short moment before death where you have time to think, just for a second. At least he has Remus and Padfoot, Lily thought. They would be good parents- Sirius would make sure Harry would have fun and be happy and free, and Remus would teach Harry all the things he would need to know, and make sure he didn't get into too much trouble. If Sirius raised him, he would probably be the bane of McGonagall's existence, but she would love him anyway, in that way she did all of the self-proclaimed Marauders. Peter- oh Peter, how could that little rat have done this- he would go to Azkaban, probably, and she didn't want that for him, but he killed James, and he killed her. Harry would be okay, she told herself. Everything would be okay. She needed it to be okay. She loved him so much, more than anyone else, and she needed him to be okay. It was all going to be okay, she thought, and then the world fell around her and it all went dark.


 


The worst thing is that Lily knew it wasn't really okay. Everyone was a little bit wrong, in a way. There was no castle in the clouds, or gilded palace, and there was no bearded man. She was there with James, and they couldn't see what happened out in the world. They didn't know what was happening to Harry, not really, and that was terrifying. She got glimpses, right after she died, but after that she saw nothing. She saw Severus enter her home, clutching her lifeless body, and she felt distinctly uncomfortable. She saw him ignore her Harry as he wailed and cried and watched an adult who didn't care about him. She saw Sirius arrive and yell at Severus, telling him not to disrespect her corpse. She saw him pick up Harry and wrap him in his coat, rocking him and gently pressing a kiss to the new spidery scar on his forehead. Oh Merlin, her son defeated Voldemort. Her baby. Then she saw Hagrid come and take the baby from Sirius, taking him to Albus, probably. She saw the funeral, where Remus stood stranded without his brothers. She saw the dirt that covered her grave fall upon her, and she saw nothing more, beyond feelings and ideas of what happened.


 


They were all so broken, now. Sirius was in prison, and Peter escaped, and Remus was all alone in a world that would tear him into bits more than he himself already did. She and James were in some sort of after, not knowing what was happening anymore beyond vague feelings, and Harry was left without his family. 


 


Harry.


 


He was going to grow up alone, thinking he is dirty and freakish and wrong. He wasn't going to know any different, either. Lily wanted to cradle him in her arms just one more time, and she knew James wanted to give him one last kiss, but neither would ever happen.


 


Because Halloween was over, and they were dead.

This in itself wasn't particularly unusual. Harry, like many young boys, had often thought about leaving home. After all, being able to go wherever they wanted, without anyone telling them what to do, was the dream of many children.

Harry Potter probably thought about it more often than most though. He thought about it whenever his uncle shouted at him, or whenever his aunt sneered at him. He thought about it when his cousin and his gang chased him so they could try to stuff his head down the toilet, and whenever his teachers looked at him with vapid expressions of pity.

In short, Harry Potter had thought about it nearly every day for the past seven years.

The difference between Harry and all the other children with similar dreams was that Harry was perfectly capable of carrying making his dream a reality.

Harry had been planning his escape for a long time, but recent events had forced his hand. It wasn't unusual for Harry to get far better reports from his teachers than his cousin Dudley. It also wasn't difficult, considering Dudley had the intelligence of a juvenile rabbit, but for some reason Vernon and Petunia had never gotten used to it. They had taken to ignoring it after even their most severe threats failed to get Harry to dumb himself down, but this year they couldn't ignore the rather pointed note attached to Harry's report from his headmistress. Miss Pevensie was old but she wasn't stupid, and she wasn't blind enough to miss the differences between loud, spoiled Dudley and his little ghost of a cousin. Harry had been sent to his cupboard the second Vernon had seen the letter, but his uncle's shouts about child services and reports of abuse had been impossible to ignore.

Harry didn't care. Maybe the authorities would help, but they never had before and he had no intention of taking his chances.

So the next morning, Harry decided that enough was enough. He left his schoolbooks behind, instead packing the few tolerable clothes he possessed into his small rucksack. There was nothing else he cared to take; everything he owned had been broken by Dudley before being passed on to him. He dressed in his school uniform, and looked round his cupboard for the last time.

Really, Harry hadn't had to stay in the cupboard. Young as he was, there were plenty ways he could have persuaded or intimidated his relatives into giving him Dudley's spare room. In the end though he hadn't bothered with the effort. He had never been planning on staying long, and the less the Dursleys knew about what he could do the better. More importantly, the less the other authorities knew about his abilities the better.

Harry wasn't stupid. He might know very little about how his world worked in this time, but no society would be so idiotic as to leave children with their power unsupervised. Any intentional displays of magic would undoubtedly attract attention, and that would lead to questions that Harry had no desire to answer.

For example, how he knew about magic at all.

Harry snorted softly. That question alone could cause utter chaos. Much better to wait until he had more information

A sharp rap on the door woke Harry from his thoughts.

""Hurry up, or you'll be late, boy.""

Harry's lip curled, but he opened the door without comment. Petunia sneered down at him. ""You've missed breakfast, but that can't be helped. We're leaving now.""

Harry said nothing. He just met her pale blue eyes with his green ones until the sneer faded into something more uncertain. Petunia's lips thinned, but instead of scolding him, she just shook her head sharply. ""Don't be late.""

She hurried Dudley out the door with far more haste than normal, and Harry was gratified to see a gleam of fear and confusion in her eyes as she glanced back over her shoulder. Then the door slammed shut and Harry was alone in the house.

Vernon hadn't been happy, but after Dudley threw four tantrums in a row about the freak walking into school with him, he had agreed that Harry would leave five minutes after Dudley and Petunia each morning. Harry hadn't particularly minded; any time away from Dudley was fine by him, and he had been amused by how quickly the teachers picked up on their unusual situation, but he appreciated the arrangement now.

It was tempting to leave a suitable farewell for the Dursleys, but Harry resisted the impulse. He wanted as good a head start as he could get before the chaos started. Not that it really mattered, considering where he was going, but it would draw things out for his charming relatives. Instead, Harry headed up to the attic.

One of the first things Harry could remember was Petunia telling him never to go into the attic. Naturally, it was one of the first things Harry had done, once he was strong enough. The place was full of Vernon and Petunia's rubbish, but there were a few items of interest. Harry shoved a stack of Dudley's old pre-school work out the way until he spotted the box of dusty photo albums poking out from under a bag of old clothes. He was keen to leave as soon as possible, but he had never been able to resist the urge to take a look.

Harry carefully picked up one of the more faded albums and opened it. Two smiling Muggles beamed up at him, and Harry felt his own lips twitch up. The photo was in black and white, but he knew from other photos that his grandmother's eyes were exactly the same colour as his own. Both of his grandparents were white though, so Harry's own skin and hair colour had presumably come from his father's side. That was all Harry knew about his father, but he pushed that thought to one side. There would be information about him somewhere, and Harry had no intention of stopping until he found it.

Reluctantly, Harry set that album aside and found the more recent ones. These ones were all in colour, and there was a familiar tightness in Harry's chest as he looked at his mother's face. If he hadn't found these photos, Harry wouldn't even have known her name. He thanked every god he knew that someone had recorded the date and people present on the back of each photo. There were some of Lily and Petunia as small children, sometimes with a tiny wrinkled old woman who Harry assumed was his great-grandmother, and then there were some of Lily as a young lady, laughing and carefree, with her whole future before her.

Harry's fingers trembled as he traced his mother's face. What had happened? He knew absolutely nothing about their lives. He didn't know why they had met their deaths by the Killing Curse, if that was the green light in his nightmares was, or why he had been placed with people who might be his blood relatives but still loathed him simply for who he was. He didn't know why none of their friends had ever tried to check on him.

Harry didn't have answers to those questions. But he was going to find out.

For now though, he had wasted enough time. He raided the albums for his favourite pictures, and placed the photos carefully in a plastic wallet he'd taken from Dudley's school supplies. He needed them more than Petunia did. Harry cast a final quick glance round, then settled his rucksack more comfortably on his shoulders and closed his eyes.

It wasn't the best idea he had ever had. Apparition was tricky even for a grown wizard. Harry remembered all too vividly the last time he had tried it at this young age, but he forced the memories away with a shudder. Thinking about that wouldn't help. He was tempted to wait a few more months, just to let his magic stabilise, but he dismissed the thought almost immediately. The situation with the Dursleys had become intolerable, and Harry knew he could do this. He had before after all.

So Harry Potter summoned up all the magic he possessed and concentrated on the one place he could truly call home.

There was the familiar awful-wonderful twisting wrenching bending stretching sensation then Harry landed on cold stone and his mind burst into song.

'Welcome home, Salazar!""

Salazar Slytherin, founder of Hogwarts, now nearly nine year old Harry Potter closed his eyes and let the magic of Hogwarts surround him. Wards wrapped around him as easily as if a day had passed rather than a thousand years, and tears fell unheeded as Hogwarts' love and respect soothed his battered mind and soul.

'Thank you,' he finally managed. 'It is good to be home.'

Hogwarts seemed to hum louder, and for a minute Harry let himself just bask in the warmth of her welcome. It had been so long since anyone had treated him with more than wary pity.

But there was something he had to know.


'Have any of the others been here?'


There was a heavy sigh and Harry's heart sank even before the soft whisper sounded. 'Only you.'

Harry drew in a deep, shuddering breath. Where could they be? He couldn't do this without them. He rubbed fiercely at his eyes and tried to think. He had made no plans to be reborn after his death, and he wouldn't have had time to carry out any rituals anyway, considering the nature of his demise. That meant that someone, be it a god, the fates, or even magic itself, had intervened.

Whoever it was, they had to have brought the others back too. Harry didn't know what was going on, but he did know that he couldn't do it alone. He needed his family.

But if they weren't here, where were they?

'They may not be old enough,' Hogwarts pointed out. 'Witches and wizards do not come here until they are eleven now, and you are younger than that.'

Harry sat back and nodded. 'You're right. I just hope they get here soon.' If they didn't... His mind shied away from the possibility.

'The new school year starts in six weeks,' Hogwarts offered. 'One or all of them might arrive then.'

'I hope so,' said Harry quietly.

Hogwarts wrapped his mind in another gentle hug, and Harry leaned into the contact. 'You are not alone, Salazar. You will never be alone.'

Harry smiled. He knew he was right. He took a deep breath, then got to his feet. He couldn't sit around waiting for his friends for the next six weeks. He might be only a child, but there was still plenty he could do. Especially here in Hogwarts.

There was one immediate matter to deal with. 'What happened in here?'

Harry had decided to land in the Chamber of Secrets out of sheer practicality. He hadn't been sure when the holidays for Hogwarts would be, and hadn't wanted to risk landing in the middle of a crowded corridor. As the Chamber was hidden, and sealed to any but a Parselmouth, it had seemed the most suitable location.

Which it was. It was also half flooded with water.

'Ah,' said Hogwarts. There was a clear note of embarrassment in her voice. 'Well, things got a little complicated when the Muggles invented plumbing. One of Selene's descendants had to rework the entire system.'

Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. 'Right. I'll deal with that later. What about Issa?'

'She is well,' Hogwarts assured him. 'But she is very old, and sleeps a great deal.'

Harry smiled. 'I'm not surprised. I'll wake her once I settle in.' He looked around and sighed. 'Looks like I'll be staying in the Room of Requirement after all.' He would make time to come down and visit Issa later, and he would also have to make sure his wards on the rest of the Chamber had held. There were things down here that were never meant to see the light of day again.

But that could wait for another day. Harry climbed to his feet, picked up his rucksack, and willed himself to the Room of Requirement.

Harry reappeared in an exact replica of his old chambers, and smiled. 'Thank you.'

'My pleasure,' Hogwarts replied.

Harry let out a contented sigh as he shrugged out of his rucksack. He had missed Hogwarts, and he had missed having his own space, and it was so good to be home. 'Have any students found this place yet?'

'Not for many years,' said Hogwarts with a chuckle. 'Even the teachers have only ever stumbled across it by accident.'

Harry smirked. 'Rowena will be pleased to hear that.' He started taking his clothes out of his rucksack, then paused. Looking at the stained and baggy cast-offs made him think of the Dursleys, and he had no intention of thinking about those people unless he absolutely had to. 'Do we still keep spare robes?'

There was a slight pause before Hogwarts replied. 'We do. But, Salazar, there is a house-elf outside who wishes to speak with you.'

Harry closed his eyes for a moment. 'I should have expected that.' He set the clothes down on the bed and took a deep breath. 'Let them in.'

Hogwarts touched his mind in a brief second of comfort, then the door swung open to reveal an old house-elf. He was dressed in a clean tea towel with the Hogwarts crest on it, and his eyes went as wide as saucers when he caught sight of Harry. Harry smiled and knelt down so they were at eye level.

""Hello,"" he said gently. ""Please come in. What is your name?""

The house-elf visibly swallowed and took a few steps into the room. ""I is called Pento,"" he said.

Harry nodded. ""It's nice to meet you, Pento. Why are you here?""

Pento hesitated, then lifted his head to meet Harry's gaze properly. ""We house-elves felt the old Master return,"" he said clearly. ""We did not understand, but we are here to serve, and serve we will, if that is Master's wish.""

For a moment, Harry could only stare at him. The house-elves were bound to Hogwarts, and so Harry had guessed that they would be alerted to his presence, but he hadn't expected them to recognise him. Pento's ears fell. ""Have we displeased, Master?"" he asked tentatively.

Harry blinked and shook his head. ""No, Pento. Not at all."" He took a breath. ""Thank you for your service. All I ask is that you do not tell anyone that I am here.""

Pento nodded vigorously. ""I understand, Master."" He gave Harry a warm smile. ""All of Hogwarts is happy that you is home.""

Harry suddenly found it impossible to speak around the lump in his throat. ""I'm very happy to be home too, Pento.""

Pento tilted his head to one side, and studied Harry for a long minute. ""Master needs looking after,"" he said suddenly. ""Master has not been happy in a long time."" His eyes narrowed as they took in Harry's clothes. ""Pento will send elves to help Master."" He bowed very low, then disappeared with a loud crack.

Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head. He had forgotten how protective house-elves could be of masters they felt deserved it. Not for the first time he mentally thanked Helga for being so passionate in her advocacy of house-elf rights. He, Godric and Rowena had learned easily as much from her as she had from them. None of them had treated house-elves badly to begin with, all their families having taught them better than that, but Helga was something else.

The thought of his friends sent a sharp pang through Harry's chest. He missed them more than he could say. His hands curled into fists, and he felt Hogwarts' silent support. He would find them again. No matter how long it took.

In the meantime, however, he had a lot of catching up to do.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Albus Dumbledore frowned.

Unlike some of his colleagues, frowning was not Albus' expression of choice. He much preferred to solve problems with twinkling eyes, a genial smile, and enough nonsense that people ended up too confused to argue. However, while that method worked very well on witches, wizards, Muggles, and anyone else who happened to argue with him, it was far less effective on inanimate objects.

Which was why Albus was reduced to frowning at the small silver device lying motionless on his desk.

Albus had many such devices. Most were tied to the Hogwarts wards, or were alarms relating to his various other positions. Being Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, for example, dictated that he could always be contacted in case of an emergency. This one, however, was different. It was the only tied to a specific individual. It was extremely basic, Albus had felt uncomfortable with even a limited breach of privacy, but when the individual in question was Harry Potter, Albus had reluctantly decided that the intrusion was necessary. He had done his best to limit it though. All the device told him was that Harry was within his relatives' wards, and that he was safe.

In all the time Harry had been with the Dursleys the device had never so much as twitched. That lunchtime though, Albus had returned to his office after a long session in court to find the silver glowing a soft amber. Since Albus had set it to turn bright crimson if Harry was ever in real danger, Albus had been confused, but not particularly alarmed.

That had changed when he investigated further and found that the wards on Number 4 Privet Drive had shattered beyond repair. Albus had been on the verge of immediately Apparating to Little Whinging, when he realised that, despite the state of the blood wards, all indications were that Harry Potter was not in danger. In fact, he was as safe as he had ever been.

Albus rested his chin on his fingertips and considered the matter. Harry was safe. That was the most important thing. However, something had clearly happened at Privet Drive, and Albus had to find out what. He was just debating whether to ask Minerva to visit or to go in person when the entire castle was rocked by a pulse of pure magic and every alarm on Albus' desk started screaming.

Albus was on his feet immediately, drawing on his connection with the wards in an attempt to find the source of the outburst, but his mind was racing. All the students had left the previous week, along with most of the teachers. Even Argus had gone to Cornwall for the holidays. The only people currently in the castle were himself, Minerva, and the house-elves, and none of them should be capable of this. He reached out, but another burst of magic made him stagger back with a cry.

Anger, pain, despair, fury... The emotions tore through the castle with such ferocity that Albus had to break his connection. He leaned on the desk, his head pounding and thoughts whirling. Who could possibly be responsible for this? And how?

From what seemed like a very great distance he heard footsteps, then the door was flung open.

""Albus, what is going on?""

Albus shook his head, and straightened up in time to meet Minerva McGonagall's anxious gaze. ""I do not know,"" he said flatly. ""I cannot isolate the source of the disturbance.""

Minerva stared at him. ""What? How is that possible?""

Albus could only shake his head again. He hated not knowing something, but this was beyond anything he had ever experienced. Minerva took a step closer. ""All the ghosts can feel it,"" she said. ""I passed Sir Nicholas and the Friar on the way up. In all these years I've never seen them so agitated.""

Albus rubbed at his eyes. ""I am not surprised. Whoever is doing this has some connection to Hogwarts, but I cannot for the life of me understand how.""

The thought was more than a little terrifying. He waited for Minerva's input, but his deputy didn't reply. Albus frowned. ""Minerva?""

Minerva was staring out the window, her eyes as wide as saucers. ""Albus,"" she whispered.

Albus followed her gaze, and his mouth fell open. The previously blue skies were now dark with thick storm clouds, and trees were whipping to and fro in a ferocious gale. Even as the two stunned professors watched, the heavens opened and rain began to fall, lightly at first, but soon it was coming down in heavy sheets. Lightning lit the sky, followed almost immediately by a dull rumble of thunder, and Minerva turned her dazed face towards him.

""What in the name of Merlin is going on?""

Deep in the library, Harry Potter was heedless of the devastation he was causing. He was staring at the books in front of him, his hands curled into fists, and shaking so hard he could barely think.

""Hated Muggles and Muggleborns,"" he spat. ""Hid a monster in the school to murder them all.""

'Salazar,' Hogwarts tried, but Harry barely heard her.

""Left the school after duelling Godric over blood purity!""


'Salazar-'


""Slytherin is the home of Dark wizards in training, Gryffindors are heroes, Ravenclaws are know-it-alls, and Hufflepuffs are too pathetic to go anywhere else?""

Harry gave up trying to control himself. Every window in the library shattered, and the books in front of him went flying. Harry felt Hogwarts trying to get his attention, but the storms was free now and he threw himself into it. All the rage and horror and despair of the last hour overflowed, and all Harry could do was ride it out.

It didn't take long. Harry's young body simply couldn't channel the magic necessary for maintaining a storm of that intensity. Bare minutes later the thunder and lightning died, and the rain was fading to a light drizzle, and Harry was drained to the point of numbness.

""How did this happen?"" he whispered.

It wasn't true. None of it. Yes, he had hated Muggles, but they had murdered his family right before him! They had condemned their own kin simply because they were different. And there were so many others. Helga had done nothing but help the people of her village, and they had nearly killed her for it. If Salazar hadn't been there... And how many others had died because Muggles hated anyone who wasn't exactly like them?

Harry forced himself to breathe deeply. Yes, he had been wary of Muggleborns, but Helga had opened his eyes. After all, Muggleborns were even more at risk from Muggles than pure bloods or half-bloods. At least those with magical heritage knew what was going on, and how to control their powers. Muggleborns hadn't been nearly so lucky.

That was why it had been so important that Hogwarts be a refuge for all children with magic. Salazar had never argued with that. He certainly wouldn't have fought Godric and let the school over it.

That was another thing Harry couldn't understand. He and Godric had fought all the time, but that was what brothers did. They understood each other, and the duel that day had been nothing out of the ordinary. It was pure bad luck that Salazar had been killed before he had had a chance to return.

Harry shivered, and forced that memory aside. He knew better than to think about his death.

But how could anyone think he would willingly leave his home? Or the only real family he had ever had?

Harry stared round at the destruction he had caused, and choked back a sob. How had everything gone so wrong?

There was a very tentative brush against his mind, and Harry flinched.

""Sorry,"" he whispered.

He was instantly engulfed in a warm mental hug, and Harry had to smile. Hogwarts, at least, didn't care what the books said about him. She knew the truth. And so would his friends.

In the meantime, he couldn't afford to lose control again. Harry sighed, and with the last of his concentration repaired the broken windows with a wave of his hand. The effort left him dizzy, and he made a mental note to obtain a wand as soon as possible. From what he had gathered he was too young to go out and buy one, and the gods only knew what had happened to his original ones, but there were bound to be some in the Room of Requirement. With any luck one would suit his needs well enough until he could disguise himself and buy one properly.

Until then, he would just have to be careful. Sighing, Harry dragged his aching body out of the chair and began to gather up the scattered books. Considering the chaos he had caused in the wards it was unlikely that Headmaster Dumbledore would be able to isolate his presence in the library, but there was no point in being overtly obvious.

But although Harry's rage had faded, he knew it would be a long time before he came to terms with what had happened to his name and house. After all, they had been the only things he had ever been truly proud of. Without those, what was he?

One thing Harry was certain of though, was that he was going to make this right.

""Anything?""

Albus blew out an exhausted breath and sat back in his chair. ""I am afraid not.""

Minerva sank down into the chair opposite him and fixed him with a concerned look. ""Albus, how could someone be in Hogwarts and affecting the wards so severely without you being alerted to it?""

Albus shook his head slowly. ""I do not know,"" he said slowly. ""The only thing I can think of is that the intruder was not a threat to this school?""

""Not a threat?"" Minerva exclaimed. ""Albus, you felt that power!""

""I did,"" Albus confirmed. ""But I also felt that power being carefully diverted away from the house-elves, and even from us."" Minerva opened her mouth, but Albus held up a hand. ""I truly do not believe that this intruder intended any harm to anyone in this castle.""

Minerva's eyes narrowed. ""And what about that storm?"" she demanded. ""You can't tell me that was a normal occurrence?""

Albus shook his head. ""No,"" he agreed softly. ""That...that was something I thought impossible.""

While a degree of control over the elements were fairly common among talented wizards, every child in their world knew better than to play with the weather itself. Even Albus, powerful as he was, had never dared to meddle with such things. He had thought the stories of wizards who could do such things legends at most.

Minerva had gone very pale. ""But how could such a person come here undetected?""

""I don't know,"" said Albus quietly. ""But should they attempt to cause harm to anyone in this school, they will come to regret it.""

Minerva held his gaze for a minute, then let out a long breath. ""I will alert Filius, Pomona, and Severus to what has happened,"" she said. ""We will take it turns to stay, just in case.""

Albus smiled at her. ""Thank you, Minerva. This is one threat which may require all our strength.""

Minerva sighed. ""I just hope you are right, and that this person means us no harm."" She rose to her feet and straightened her green robes. ""If that is all, Albus?""

Albus made a split-second decision. ""Actually, Minerva, there was one other little matter.""

Very slowly, Minerva turned back to face him. ""I'm not sure I like the sound of this,"" she said grimly.

Albus winced mentally, but he hadn't been sorted into Gryffindor for nothing. ""It appears something has happened to Harry Potter.""

The look Minerva shot him could have frozen a Dementor in its tracks. Albus sighed and braced himself. This was not going to go well.

Harry was silent for several minutes as Hogwarts recounted the conversation between the Headmaster and his deputy. He was back in the Room of Requirement, nibbling from the 'light' lunch the house-elves had brought up for him. Honestly, sometimes he thought he was doomed to have people always demanding he put on weight, but there were more important things to be worrying about than people mothering him.

'Do you trust Dumbledore?' he asked, when Hogwarts finished.

'He would do anything for the students of this school,' Hogwarts replied immediately. 'He is intelligent and powerful, and is perhaps the only person that Voldemort ever feared.'

Harry's lip curled. He had come across Voldemort, and therefore himself, in the library, and the accounts he had read had very nearly triggered another outburst. Harry had long ago sworn to stop any Dark wizards who threatened innocents. Murdering Lily and James Potter had simply moved Voldemort to the top of the list. But at least Harry now knew how his parents had died, and why Dumbledore was so concerned about his disappearance.

What he didn't know, though, was why the man had sought to place him with his magic-hating relatives.


'He thought he was doing what was best for you.'


Harry sighed. Sometimes it was annoying how well Hogwarts knew him. 'He thought placing with me with people who hate the essence of what I am was best?'

'He did not make the decision lightly,' said Hogwarts pointedly. 'He and Minerva have had many discussions about it, but the fact remains that your mother's sacrifice created a very powerful form of protection.'

'I am familiar with blood wards,' Harry reminded her. 'And I can understand why he didn't want me growing up in the magical world.' He had read of the Death Eater attacks even after Voldemort's disappearance. Even hidden, he would have put any magical family who took him in at risk, and then there was the fact that vanquishing the most feared Dark wizard of their generation might well have gone to anybody's head. As much as Harry hated to admit it, he could understand Dumbledore's reasons for placing him with his Muggle relatives.

That didn't change the fact that said relatives were vastly unsuited to raising a magical child. If Harry hadn't faced much worse in his first life he might have snapped long ago.


'He still has plans for you.'


Harry just nodded. Dumbledore seemed like the sort of man who had to be in control, and if Voldemort really wasn't dead then the Headmaster was hardly likely to let his little saviour go his own way.

Harry wasn't sure if he and Dumbledore were going to agree on very much, but he did agree that Voldemort wasn't dead.


'What are you going to do?'


Harry took a deep breath. 'I'm not going back there. The wards when broke when I left; there'd be no point. And I'm not going to tell him where I am.'

Hogwarts' voice took on a reproachful edge. 'He's going to worry.'

Harry shrugged. 'He knows I'm alive. He'll know where I am when I start here in two years. Until then, it serves him right.'

If Hogwarts had eyes Harry had no doubt she'd be rolling them, but he didn't care. Dumbledore could try to control him all he wanted, but he was going to have at least a couple of years of peace.

Besides, he was allowed to be a bit vindictive. He was only eight after all.

Minerva McGonagall stared at the perfectly kept street and sighed.

Minerva didn't disapprove of the order. Unlike certain colleagues, she was quite capable of appreciating a neighbourhood where the residents clearly took pride in appearances. Magic was wonderful, certainly, but the quiet little Muggle street was pleasant enough.

Unfortunately, Minerva was very aware that some of the residents were not.

Honestly, she had never completely agreed with placing Harry with his relatives. She could understand Albus' reasoning; the boy had been safe here, and she had enough memories of what James Potter had been like when he first came to Hogwarts to be glad that his son wouldn't have the chance to let his fame go to his head, but she had still been uneasy. Minerva had met the entire Evans family when she introduced Lily to the magical world, and she was aware of the effect it had on Petunia. She had hoped the woman would have been able to look past her resentment, and maybe she would have, if her husband had not been equally disturbed by the wizards he had encountered. Minerva had loved James like a nephew, but he and Sirius Black were not the people she would have chosen to introduce Vernon Dursley to magic.

Minerva shivered, and shook her head sharply. There was nothing to be done about the past, but she could at least do something for their son now. Taking a deep breath, she strode up to Number 4 and rang the doorbell.

There was silence for a few seconds, then the door opened and Minerva came face to face with Petunia Evans for the first time in over thirty years.

Minerva felt a brief surge of pity. The awkward girl she had met all those years ago had grown into a tall woman with blonde hair, a long neck, and unfortunately large front teeth. Growing up with a sister like Lily couldn't have been easy for the poor woman. Petunia's pale eyes, so different from her sister's, widened.

""You!""

Minerva raised an eyebrow. ""It is a pleasure to see you again, Mrs. Dursley. May I come in?""

She didn't give the woman a chance to answer. She brushed past easily, taking in the strictly ordered hallway before entering the living room. That too was perfectly kept, but Minerva's eyes narrowed as she scanned the photographs decorating the walls and mantelpiece. There were many of Petunia, Vernon and their son, but none of a little boy with James' face and Lily's eyes. A dozen of Dudley Dursley, and not a single sign of any other boy living in the house.

Minerva couldn't blame Harry for running away in the slightest.

""He's not here.""

Minerva turned to see Petunia standing the doorway. Her thin arms were folded across her chest, and she was watching Minerva with undisguised wariness. ""The boy,"" she said, at Minerva's look. ""I assume that's why you're here.""

Minerva didn't bother to deny it. ""When did you last see him?""

""Yesterday morning, before we left for school,"" said Petunia curtly. ""He was late, so Dudley and I left without him.""

Minerva bit back the urge to point out that Harry was only eight years old. There were more important things to worry about. ""Did he go to school?""

""No."" Her lips pursed. ""The school called me, but he was gone by the time I got home. I thought he had gone with one of your lot.""

""Professor Dumbledore told you that it wasn't safe for him with us,"" Minerva pointed out. ""We had nothing to do with this.""

Petunia's eyes widened ever so slightly, before her expression closed and she looked away. ""We haven't seen him,"" she repeated. ""If he ever does come back, I will contact you."" The expression on her face made it quite clear that she wasn't expecting him to, but Minerva was slightly surprised by the fact that she would be willing to take him again.

""Can you tell me anything about him?"" she asked. ""It may help us to work out where he has gone.""

Petunia shook her head. ""He doesn't talk to us. Or to anyone, really.""

Minerva thought of how cheerful Lily always was, and how confident James had been and her chest ached. ""I see."" She considered pressing the matter, but Petunia was looking more and more tense with every passing moment. ""Thank you for your time, Petunia.""

Petunia twitched slightly at the use of her name, but jerked her head in acknowledgement. It wasn't until she had opened the door that she spoke. ""Do you know if he's safe?""

Minerva blinked, but covered her surprise quickly. ""He is,"" she assured the younger woman. ""We do not know exactly where he is, but we do know that he is not in any danger.""

Petunia held her gaze for a moment, then a little of the tension seemed to leave her body. ""Thank you."" Then the door shut, and Minerva was left alone on the doorstep.

Minerva sighed and began to head down the street. Petunia might care more for Harry than even she realised, but it was clear that the boy's childhood had not been a happy one. It really was no wonder he had left. Minerva was almost glad that they had no idea where he had gone; at least she wouldn't have to face sending him back to that place.

One thing was certain. If Harry Potter ever did return, Minerva was going to do whatever she could to make up for this.

Harry, meanwhile, was enjoying the best summer he had had in his current lifetime. Hogwarts was delighted to have him back, and the house-elves had welcomed him with open arms. Harry had been bemused at first, wondering why they weren't terrified at the sudden reappearance of the evil founder, but Hogwarts had set him straight.

'I know you are no threat,' she had said, when Harry finally worked out how to ask what was going on. 'And they are bound to me just as you are. Unless you completely change who you are, they will continue to trust you as completely as I do.'

Harry had been too touched by her words to speak, but the elves themselves had soon proven the castle right. Pento had assigned a young female elf called Teaky to look after him, and Teaky had taken her duties very seriously. She had been horrified at Harry's clothes, and had replaced all his ragged hand-me-downs with proper robes within two hours of meeting him, much to Harry's amusement and gratitude. She was also the main party responsible for the 'fatten up Harry' campaign, a mission that the other elves had taken very much to heart. After years of surviving off of the absolute basics, the attention was quite welcome, even if Harry had initially struggled with feelings of being smothered, but Teaky had made sure to give him the space he needed and the two soon got along as well as Harry ever had with the elves in his first life.

Not only was Harry being well-looked after, he also had plenty to keep him occupied. One of the first things he had done was to thoroughly review the wards and protective enchantments around the school. For the most part his work had survived remarkably well, but there was some inevitable damage from the last thousand years that Harry had immediately started planning to rectify. There were also traces of a nasty curse tied into one of the minor wards, but Harry had been unable to properly identify it without a wand.

Hence why finding a suitable wand was the other thing at the top of Harry's to-do list. And since going wandering around in his current appearance was hardly the best plan in the world, the Room of Requirement it was.

So the day after his relocation found Harry sitting on the floor at the foot of his bed staring out at the sea of wands in front of him.

""How could this many people be stupid enough to lose their wands?""

Hogwarts snorted. 'You know what students are like. Some were merely careless, others got new ones that fitted better and didn't care to dispose of their old ones properly. But really, Salazar, are you complaining?'

Harry had to smile. ""Not at all, my dear."" At least there was bound to be something he could work with. Shaking his head, Harry picked up the closest wand and set to work.

It took nearly an hour, but Harry finally settled on a ten inch wand made of pine. To his delight, it responded well to even non-verbal spells, and some more extensive tests proved it could handle all fields of magic more than willingly. Harry smiled at it as he collected the rest of the wands in a neat pile and tidied them away. Being without a wand had been without one of his limbs, and the new freedom the added versatility would grant him was euphoric.

There was one spell in particular he had wanted to try the moment he came across it the previous day. Harry stood up, concentrated hard, then flicked his wand in a circle around his head.

""Praetereo,"" he whispered.

The resulting sensation was peculiar to say the least. Harry felt like someone had doused him in cold water, but any discomfort was forgotten the moment he looked in the mirror and saw nothing but a faint outline. Harry reversed the charm and grinned at his reflection. ""I love magic.""

It took a couple more hours of practice, but Harry was eventually satisfied with his ability to perform the charm non-verbally so that would render him completely invisible, as long as he didn't make any sudden movements. Harry still wasn't sure how he had come to exist in this time and body, but if it gave him the chance to learn spells like that then he wasn't complaining in the slightest.

Armed with his wand and the Disillusionment Charm, Harry started to risk going further afield. He wandered the corridors of Hogwarts at will, and it was on these journeys that he caught his first glimpses of the current staff. Headmaster Dumbledore's unusual sense of style made him smile, but the sheer power he exuded left Harry confident that at least this Headmaster could protect their students. He was even more reassured by the kindness with which the man treated the house-elves though; that protection should extend to every inhabitant of the castle, and Dumbledore seemed to agree. Harry still wasn't happy with his own treatment at Dumbledore's hands, but he was willing to reserve judgement until he met the man properly.

Harry also found chances to observe the four heads of the houses. He approved of Professors McGonagall and Sprout, both of whom clearly knew exactly what they were doing, and who cared for the students just as much, if not more so, than Dumbledore did. He also liked Professor Flitwick, whose irrepressible nature and undeniable talent reminded him so much of Godric that Harry had to immediately flee to the Room of Requirement to get his emotions under control. It took him longer than he would have liked, but Harry was left with the confidence that Gryffindor, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were in good hands.

Slytherin, however, was another matter.

There was no doubt that Severus Snape was a very talented wizard. Harry could sense the power the man possessed, and he observed enough conversations undetected to see that Snape had the intelligence to match it. In those respects, he was worthy of leading Slytherin house. However, Harry could also feel the sharp bite of Dark magic that clung to the man, and he recognised the aura of bitterness and guilt all too well. It was a dangerous combination, and Harry decided to keep a very wary eye on Snape once the term started. He left the wizard's presence feeling uneasy, and more concerned than ever about the fate of his beloved house.

Harry wasn't left completely to his own devices though.

He had noticed the ghosts immediately, of course, and had been neither surprised nor annoyed by their presence. Ghosts were common enough in magical buildings, and Hogwarts was special even by magical standards. Besides, it made life more interesting for the students. He was less impressed that after ten centuries no one had managed to get rid of the bloody poltergeist, but at least the spirit limited itself to relatively harmless acts of mischief. All in all, Harry was quite content to avoid and ignore the spirit population of Hogwarts until he could risk appearing as an actual student.

At least, he was until he recognised one of the ghosts.

Harry had been on his way back from the library when he met her. The castle had been deserted but for the house-eves, Dumbledore away on one of his regular excursions, and Harry hadn't seen any need to waste energy Apparating around the school. He had been on his way up to the seventh floor when the ghost popped out of the wall in front of him.

Ordinarily Harry would have Apparated away immediately. He'd done it once before, and had been slightly concerned when the ghost's head nearly fell off, but he was quick enough that nothing had come of it. He had been preparing to do the same when he happened to look in the ghost's face and everything seemed to stop.

""Helena?""

The ghost of Helena Ravenclaw froze in mid-air before slowly turning to peer down at him. ""Who are you?"" she demanded. Her eyes ran over him, and her lips thinned. ""You are no student.""

Harry swallowed. He had never expected to see anyone from his past, at least not in the same guise as they had before, but Helena... She was older than he remembered, but she was there and all the years seemed to disappear.

""Child,"" he said softly. ""Do you not remember me?""

Helena stared. ""Who are you?"" she whispered. ""No one has called me that-""

""In ten centuries,"" said Harry softly. He tilted his head back, missing the days when she barely used to reach his knee, and looked her straight in the eye. ""Hello, Helena.""

If ghosts could pale, Helena would have done so. As it was, she jerked backwards, eyes widening. ""This...this is impossible... This is a joke. Peeves-!""

""You know better, Little One,"" said Harry.

It was the name only he had ever used for her, and it stopped her in her tracks. Slowly, very slowly, she dropped down until she could look Harry straight in the eye. ""S-Salazar?""

Harry managed a smile. ""Don't ask me how, but yes.""

Helena shook her head. ""This is impossible,"" she repeated. ""You died.""

Harry flinched. Her words conjured memories that were difficult to avoid. ""I know,"" he managed. ""And I am so, so sorry for leaving you all.""

Helena swallowed. ""Mother wept for you,"" she whispered. ""Helga broke, and Godric never smiled the way he used to. I...I missed you."" Her eyes searched his face. ""How are you back?""

Harry's eyes were stinging, and he had to stop to wipe away tears. ""I do not know,"" he said. ""I did nothing. Eight years ago I woke, and when I was strong enough I came here and that is all I know.""

""Then...Mother?""

""I don't know. I hope so. I am praying so,"" he added in a whisper.

""As will I,"" said Helena. ""There is so much I need to say to her."" She looked at him, and gave a small smile. ""And even more I have to tell you.""

Harry smiled at her. ""I would like that. I have missed you.""

""Me too."" For a moment she looked as if she was going to say something, but then she shook her head. ""But you have yet to introduce yourself. Who exactly are you now?""

Harry sighed, but she was going to have to know at some point. ""Harry Potter.""

Helena opened her mouth, then closed it again. Harry watched in growing amusement as she visibly struggled for words, then shook her head. ""Harry Potter?""

Harry nodded.

""The Boy Who Lived.""

Harry pulled a face. ""Please don't.""

""The one who vanquished the Dark lord.""

""Helena...""

Helena laughed then, a bright pure sound that Harry hadn't realised he had missed so much. ""Only you, Uncle. Only you.""

In the end, Harry could only laugh too.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Days turned into weeks as Harry's summer passed in a blissful haze. He had originally planned to spend some time exploring the new magical world, but being at Hogwarts, where he was welcomed and accepted without hesitation, was enough that he felt no need for anything else. He spent hours in the library, easily dodging Dumbledore and the other teachers as he caught up on the centuries he had missed. History, politics, magical developments, anything, he devoured as much as he could get his hands on. If nothing else, he was going to have to keep up with Rowena somehow.

Meeting Helena had only made things better. After the shock of their respective situations had sunk in, both had been delighted by the second chance they had been given. Helena proved invaluable in catching Harry up with some of the changes that occurred at Hogwarts, and her glee at having their situations reversed was a joy to see after so many years.

Of course, it wasn't all easy going. Despite Harry's urgings Helena flatly refused to talk about her death, or about why she had chosen to return as a spirit. Harry couldn't really blame her, his own death was something he'd rather not think about given the choice, but not knowing made him feel sick to his stomach. It didn't help that he knew she was keeping something else from him too, something important, but he knew his niece well enough to know how stubborn she was. He would get the answers eventually, but it would take some time.

So Harry stuck to safe topics.

""You are sure that they will return?""

Relatively safe topics at least.

""I am not certain,"" Harry admitted. ""But I did, and I made no provision to. There is a chance that the same may be true of them.""

Helena's transparent face clearly betrayed her scepticism, but Harry could also see his own desperate hope in her eyes. Her hands clenched on her pearly dress, and she shook her head. ""We will see,"" she said softly. She shook herself, and turned a small smile on him. ""I am glad you are back at least.""

Harry just about managed to smile back. As pleasant as it was to get a second chance at life, and to see Helena again, the thought of spending the next hundred years without his family was nigh on unbearable. Some might have told him to make new friends, but Harry was a man a thousand years out of time. How could he possibly go through life pretending to be a child, never letting anyone see him for who he truly was?

Salazar had tried that once, and it had not worked out well. Harry had no intention of making the same mistake twice.

Helena's next words drew Harry straight back to their earlier discussion.

""Maybe they will be one of the students arriving next week.""

Harry stared at her. ""Next week?""

Helena shot him a bemused look. ""You didn't realise?""

Harry could only shake his head. He had run away from his relatives shortly before the start of the summer holidays. It seemed incredible that so many weeks could have passed without him noticing.

Helena grinned. ""You'll like it here when the students are back, Uncle. Things have changed a bit.""

""I have noticed something of the sort,"" said Harry dryly. ""We will see.""

Maybe Helena was right. Maybe he would hear the news he had been waiting for.

Harry kept his eyes open after that, and soon understood Helena's amusement. House-elves and teachers alike were running around with such purpose that it was a mark of just how distracted he was that he hadn't noticed the signs sooner. He noted with resignation that Helena was never going to let him forget it.

Overall though, Harry was too interested in what was going on to worry about what his niece thought of him. Preparing for a new year, with a new group of students, had always been equal parts exciting and terrifying, and from the atmosphere everywhere he went nothing had changed much. Of course some teachers seemed more excited than others, watching Professors Flitwick and Snape interact the night before the students were due to arrive was the most entertainment Harry had had all summer.

It was also a very welcome distraction from Harry's own nerves. He had been trying to stay calm about the prospect of new students arriving, but it was one of the hardest things he had ever done. He knew better than to get his hopes up, but the idea that one or more of his friends might be arriving any day was intoxicating.

The day itself was even worse. The teachers had plenty to keep themselves busy, and the house-elves had even more to do, but Harry was too agitated even to read. Helena eventually got exasperated enough to send him down to the kitchens, where the house-elves graciously put him to work. He had never had much interest in cooking, unlike Helga, but it was enough like Potions that Salazar had always been able to manage and it was a better distraction than any he could think of.

Still, by the time Hagrid left to collect the students, Harry was a nervous wreck. He had hidden himself at the entrance of one of the secret passages in the Entrance Hall, and for once in his life was finding it almost impossible to sit still. He could feel Hogwarts' tolerant exasperation in the back of his mind, but to his relief the castle didn't try to make conversation. Soon a prickling at the edge of his awareness alerted him to the fact that Thestral-drawn carriages carrying the older students were entering the boundaries of the wards, and he shuffled closer to the edge of the tapestry. Harry knew that none of the older students were his friends, but he was still curious to see some of the people who had benefitted from their work.

Soon enough the students started making their way through the Entrance Hall to the Great Hall. Harry watched them fondly. They were different to the students he had taught. They were more open on the whole, more innocent, but they were just as excited to be back as the children he remembered.

He didn't recognise any of them. He hadn't expected to, and he wasn't even completely sure how he would, but it still hurt.

Harry slumped back against the passage wall, and tried to think. Helena had told him that first years were now brought round to the school via the lake. If that was true, then they should be reaching the first of the true wards very soon. If any of his friends were among them he would know soon enough.

Hopefully.

Harry hadn't prayed to anything for a long time. He did now.

And Hogwarts exploded into song.

'Welcome home!'

The storm of emotion sent Harry to his knees, but he didn't care. Someone else had returned. Someone else was home.

He wasn't alone.

""Who?"" he whispered. ""Who is it?""

Hogwarts laughed. 'You wouldn't want me to spoil the surprise, now would you?' Harry scowled, and he felt the warm brush of the castle's consciousness against his. 'It will only be a few minutes.'

Harry took a deep breath. He had waited this long. A little longer wouldn't hurt. He pushed himself up, wincing at the pain in his bruised knees, and hurried back to the edge of the passage. A quick glance out showed Professor McGonagall waiting to receive the new students, and Harry grimaced. Hopefully she would leave them alone for at least a few minutes. It would be impossible to speak with whoever had arrived before the Sorting otherwise.

'Calm, Salazar. All will be well.'

Harry rolled his eyes, but at that moment there was a booming knock on the door. Harry froze, mouth suddenly bone dry, and watched as the door swung open. About fifty children scuttled in, and Harry desperately scanned their faces for any sign of recognition. He skipped over those who were clearly awestruck, paused for a second on a pair of red-headed twins he just knew would be trouble-makers, then slid over to a dark-haired boy who looked up just in time to meet Harry's gaze.

If the fierce jolt of something settling place hadn't confirmed it, the brilliant smile that lit the boy's face was more than enough to settle all doubts.

'See?'

Harry barely heard her. McGonagall was shepherding the first years towards a small antechamber on the other side of the hall, but the boy had lagged until he was at the very back of the group. He shot a final wary look at the witch, then dashed across to the tunnel and let the tapestry fall to cover the entrance.

The next thing Harry knew, he was enveloped in a bone-crushing hug.

""Thank God its you I missed you so much I'm so so sorry-""

""Godric,"" Harry wheezed. ""Can't breathe.""

But he was hugging back just as tightly, and had no intention of letting go any time soon. After so many years, something was right again.

""I'm sorry,"" Godric whispered. ""I'm so, so sorry.""

Harry squeezed his eyes shut. ""Me too. I never meant to leave you.""

Somehow, Godric hugged him tighter. ""Leave? You died, Salazar."" He drew back, and looked Harry straight in the eye. ""I should have been there.""

""And we were both to blame,"" said Harry quietly. ""I shouldn't have lost my temper."" He forced the storm of emotions under control, and shook his head. ""We can't do this now. You need to get Sorted.""

Godric though, was too busy gaping at his forehead. ""Salazar,"" he said slowly. ""Please tell me that that isn't what I think it is.""

Harry winced. Godric stared at him, then took a step back and looked him over properly. ""And why are you here at all? You're still younger than me.""

Harry sighed, but there was no way Godric would leave without at least some of the truth. ""I was placed with my Muggle relatives after my parents died."" He looked down, unwilling to meet Godric's gaze. ""They don't like magic, so I left as soon as I could. I've been here all summer.""

Godric swallowed, and pulled Harry into another hug. This time he didn't say anything, but the silent love and comfort was exactly what Harry needed.

""Next summer, you'll come home with me,"" Godric whispered after a minute. ""My parents won't mind.""

Harry suspected Godric's parents might disagree about that, but the words still sent a warm glow through his chest. Only Godric could make a promise like that. He was the only person Salazar would accept it from.

'I hate to interrupt,' Hogwarts murmured. 'But your absence has been noted.'

Godric grunted, his face setting into the mulish expression Harry knew so well, but Harry shook his head. ""We can catch up later. Right now, you've already attracted too much attention.""

Godric sighed, but stepped away. ""It's fine, I'll say I got distracted. But I'll come and find you as soon as possible.""

Harry smiled at him. ""I can't wait.""

Godric ruffled his hair fondly, easily dodging Harry's half-hearted attempts to swat him away, then paused at the tunnel entrance and glanced back. ""Oh, and my name is Cedric now. Cedric Diggory.""

""Cedric,"" Harry repeated. ""At least it's easy to remember.""

Cedric rolled his eyes, and disappeared in the direction of the Great Hall. Harry slumped back against the wall, and finally let the tears fall. Godric was back. Everything would be all right.

Harry only stayed for a few minutes before his stomach reminded him rather loudly that he hadn't eaten all day. He Apparated down to the kitchens, where the house-elves had already set aside a plate for him, and sat down out of the way to eat and watch them finish their preparations. House-elf magic was always fascinating to watch, especially in such large numbers.

He was distracted though by a sudden flare of confusion, and looked up.

""What's wrong?""

'Nothing,' said Hogwarts, after a moment. 'Godric just got Sorted.' Harry waited, but Hogwarts still sounded slightly bemused when she finally continued, 'He's in Hufflepuff.'

Harry froze with a forkful of potato halfway to his mouth. ""He's what?""

Thanks for reading! Any feedback would be appreciated.

And before anyone asks, half of the Founders and half of their reincarnations with be in their canon houses, but not necessarily the same halves. Harry, for example, will be in Slytherin. They're all open-minded enough to try something different.

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

If the wait for the students to arrive had been difficult, the one for them all to get to sleep was torturous. Harry spent the hours pacing the Room of Requirement, completely unable to sit still.

Godric was here. Well, Cedric was here, but it didn't matter. His brother was here, and the future was looking far, far brighter than it had for a very long time.

""What's keeping him?"" he muttered.

Amusement reverberated through his mind. 'He does have to wait for the rest of his house to go to bed. He'll be here soon enough.'

Harry sighed, and kept pacing. He'd already had to convince himself not to sneak into the Hufflepuff dormitories. The chances of him getting caught were slim to say the least, but it was still safer for Godric to come to him.

Ten minutes later, his patience was rewarded when the door swirled into place. Harry spun round just as Godric, no Cedric, Harry had to get used to the name, entered the room.

Harry folded his arms, and fixed his friend with a flat look. ""Hufflepuff?""

Cedric paused, then crossed the room in a few long strokes and pulled Harry into another hug. ""I missed you,"" he muttered.

""You said that already,"" Harry pointed out, but he hugged back just as hard.

""Well, it's true."" He drew back, and Harry was startled to see tears in his eyes. ""You died,"" he whispered. ""You died, and I wasn't there.""

Harry swallowed. He had been trying not to think about that, but now that Godric was here he couldn't avoid it. He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. ""It wasn't your fault, Cedric. And it wasn't mine either. It was just...how things turned out.""

""How things turned out?"" Cedric repeated. ""You were murdered! And the last thing I said to you-""

""Doesn't matter,"" Harry interrupted. ""Not any more."" Cedric opened his mouth, but he remained quiet when Harry gripped his shoulder. ""What happened in the past is done. We have a second chance now, and I don't want to waste time.""

Cedric bit his lip. He was silent for a minute, then let his shoulders slump. ""All right. Fine. But things will be different now. I swear on my life.""

Harry's own vision turned blurry, and he hurried to wipe his eyes. ""I know. We know better now.""

Cedric smiled, and this time Harry was the one to go to him for a hug. He couldn't help it. Only Dudley got hugs at Privett Drive, and ghosts weren't very good at physical contact. Cedric's grip turned crushing for a moment, then he stepped back with clear reluctance.

""I still can't believe you're Harry Potter. Though I really shouldn't be surprised.""

""Helena said the same thing,"" said Harry dryly.

Cedric nodded, his smile fading. ""Helena...I saw her at the feast. How...?""

Harry grimaced. ""She won't tell me. She knows who I am though. We'll get it out of her.""

""Preferably before Rowena arrives,"" said Cedric grimly.

Harry felt his heart skip a beat. ""You think she will? They will?""

Cedric squeezed his shoulders. ""I don't see why not. It's not like we planned to, after all, and yet here we are.""

Harry recognised the longing in his voice and swallowed. As wonderful as it was to have Godric back, things wouldn't be right until their friends joined them. ""I hope so,"" he whispered.

They stood in silence for a minute, then Harry shook his head. ""You distracted me. Hufflepuff?""

Cedric grinned, but his grey eyes remained serious. ""I have reasons.""

""Good ones?""

""When are my reasons not good ones?"" He laughed at the expression on Harry's face, and threw himself into one of the armchairs. Once Harry followed suit, he continued, ""Well, firstly, my parents are Hufflepuffs, and they will be over the moon.""

Harry raised an eyebrow but didn't comment, and after a moment Cedric's smile faded. ""But mainly because it isn't fair.""

Harry frowned at him. ""What do you mean?""

Cedric sighed. ""I know you grew up with Muggles, but you must have been catching up on everything since you got here. You've seen what people think of Hufflepuff.""

Harry's hands clenched into fists. ""I've been getting an idea.""

It had enraged him just as much as his own house's tarnished reputation had. How the virtues of loyalty, hard work, and open-mindedness could possibly been seen as anything to be ashamed of were beyond him. Cedric's grey eyes were cold as ice.

""Everyone calls Hufflepuff the house for those who weren't good enough to go anywhere else,"" he said quietly. ""We'll see if they say the same once I'm done.""

Harry managed a faint smile at that. ""Helga will appreciate it.""

""She deserves no less. This should never have happened at all."" He paused, and looked Harry straight in the eye. ""And Hufflepuff is not the only one.""

Harry didn't trust himself to reply, and so just nodded. Cedric leaned forward to grip his shoulder. ""You will prove them otherwise,"" he said fiercely. ""This is not your fault, Salazar.""

Harry snorted. ""No. Just my name and ideals that have been twisted beyond recognition."" Magic cracked in the air, and he took a moment to control himself. ""I don't know why we came back,"" he said. ""But we will make the most of it.""

Cedric gave a grim smile. ""Hogwarts will be united again. I expect Rowena will return to Ravenclaw, and Helga will be happy wherever she decides. Whatever happens, between the four of us we can set things right.""

Harry said nothing, but he let himself slump back against the soft cushions. Even with the enormity of the task facing them, just having some sort of plan, and someone to talk it over with was a relief. ""It'll be strange with half of us in different houses, but it'll be a good change of perspective,"" he said. He let out a deep breath, and closed his eyes. ""We will be fine.""

Cedric hummed in agreement, and for a minute, they sat in silence. Eventually though, Cedric sighed and sat up.

""So, are you going to tell me what happened with you?""

Harry stiffened, but Cedric's eyes held nothing but compassion, and he took a moment to gather himself. Cedric deserved to know, and Harry needed to tell someone.

""I don't remember everything,"" he said quietly. ""I remember my father telling my mother to flee with me. I remember her pleading for Voldemort to kill her instead. Then there was just green light.""

Cedric drew in a sharp breath. ""So it was the Killing Curse? How is that possible?""

Harry traced the pattern on the cushion, and shook his head. ""I don't know. I suspect my mother did something, there were Blood Wards around the Dursleys' residence that were connected to me, but I never got the chance to examine them properly."" His mouth twisted into a smile. ""And now they are redundant, to say the least.""

Cedric's jaw clenched, and Harry saw his hand move towards his wand. ""Warding was never my strong point,"" he began, and his tone would have sent Dark lords running for cover, ""but would I be correct in thinking that those ward rely on feelings of love and acceptance to attain their full potency?""

Harry made a mental note to never give his friend the Dursleys' address, and pushed himself to his feet. For some reason, he found it easier to think on the move this time round. ""They were not as bad as they could have been. They did not want me there, and they made no attempts to pretend otherwise, but they were more neglectful than outright abusive.""

""That's bad enough,"" Cedric snarled. ""They are your family.""

Harry gave him a small smile. ""Cedric, I'm fine,"" he said gently. ""Compared to the last time..."" He trailed off with a shrug.

Cedric held his gaze for a long moment, then his shoulders slumped. ""It is good to see you without the staff.""

Harry closed his eyes. ""I can run. I can climb. I might even try one of those brooms everyone likes so much."" He shook himself, and looked at Cedric. ""I'm never going back there. That's all I care about.""

Cedric still looked like he wanted to curse the Dursleys into oblivion, but he contented himself with a shake of his head. ""It's your call.""

""Thank you."" He dropped back into his chair and slumped against the cushions. ""So what's your family like this time?""

""Well, I'm a pureblood,"" Cedric began. ""My parents were both in Hufflepuff, as I said. My dad works for the Ministry of Magic, and Mum is studying for her Potions Mastery.""

Harry brightened. ""Really?""

Cedric shot him an amused look. ""Yes, I'm sure she would be happy to catch you up.""

Harry ran a sheepish hand through his hair. He would have to find a way to get some brewing done over the year. Cedric's expression made it quite clear he knew what his friend was thinking as he continued, ""A couple of magical families live nearby. Mr. Lovegood has a daughter who's a year younger than you, but the Weasleys have seven children, four of whom are at Hogwarts now."" He paused. ""I think that's right. Yeah, Bill's left."" He grinned. ""The twins started this year. I expect they'll make life interesting.""

Harry's eyes narrowed. ""Are they red-heads?""

Cedric laughed. ""That's them. I think Mr. and Mrs Weasley were pleased to be rid of them for most of the year. At least they're all in Gryffindor, so Charlie and Percy can keep them under control.""

Harry nodded, but his stomach twisted uncomfortably. He was glad Cedric had had a good life so far, but part of him couldn't help but wonder about his new friends. He knew that Cedric needed friends his own age. He couldn't afford to be isolated, and the more contacts they could make around their fellow students, the better.

Jealousy was not an attractive trait, Harry reminded himself firmly. Cedric certainly didn't deserve it.

""That reminds me,"" said Cedric suddenly. ""We need to go to Diagon Alley at some point.""

Harry blinked. ""Excuse me?""

Cedric's grin was all too familiar. ""Well, we'll have to go to Hogsmeade too, but there's a lot more choice in Diagon Alley."" He frowned suddenly. ""It's a shame they won't sell you a wand until you get your Hogwarts letter.""

""I do have one that works with me,"" said Harry absently, but his mind was whirling. ""Anyway, I have no money.""

Cedric's smile faded. ""Harry, your parents were rich,"" he said. ""At least, your father's family was. Even without a key, a blood test from the goblins will allow you access to your vault.""

Harry had known the Dursleys were lying about his parents and their wastrel status. Somehow, the confirmation still hurt. His hands were shaking, and he clenched them into fists. ""Yes. I'll do that.""

Cedric nodded. ""I'll take you. I should be all right with Side-Along Apparation, especially now that I've got a wand. Though I do need to get a secondary one.""

They had all learned the value of having a back-up wand. Harry managed a faint smile. ""I think Hogwarts can help with that.""

Right on cue, the array of wands that Harry had tested at the start of summer appeared on a table in front of them. Cedric beamed. ""I am so glad to be back. Thank you, Hogwarts.""

They both received a brief caress in acknowledgement, and Cedric began testing the wands. ""This is very useful, but also quite worrying.""

""That was my reaction,"" Harry admitted. ""What's your official wand?""

""Aspen, twelve and a half inches, with a dragon heartstring core,"" Cedric rattled off. He touched another wand, shook his head, and moved on to the next one. ""Good for Duelling and Charms work, so I can't imagine why it chose me."" Harry snorted, and Cedric grinned at him. ""You'll be pleased to know that the Ollivander family is still in business.""

""That is good news,"" Harry agreed. The family had been fine wandmakers in their time, and no doubt their skills had only increased over the intervening centuries.

Cedric eventually managed to get a satisfactory response from a laurel wand, and he was smiling as he banished the remaining wands.

""I'm almost hoping someone does try to steal it.""

""Why does it not surprise me that that that is the only piece of wandlore you ever managed to remember?"" asked Harry dryly.

Cedric pulled a face at him, but he couldn't keep the satisfied smile from his face as he ran through a series of basic spell chains with his new wand. He nodded approvingly at the results, but then his expression suddenly turned serious. ""Harry, have you thought about what you're going to do for the next two years?""

""Of course I have,"" said Harry with a huff. ""What do you take me for?""

Cedric rolled his eyes. ""You know what I mean.""

Harry relented, and shrugged. ""I'll read. I've got a lot of catching up to do. And I want to keep an eye on some of the teachers. I won't have our students receiving substandard teaching.""

""No arguments here,"" said Cedric grimly. ""Overall, Hogwarts has retained its good reputation, but I've heard some things from the Weasleys that concern me.""

Harry set his jaw. That would not do. ""We'll see what we can do.""

They might be only nine and eleven respectively, but they were also Founders of Hogwarts. Woe betide any who underestimated them within the walls of their home.

The moment was broken when Harry let out a jaw-cracking yawn. Cedric grinned, but a moment later, found himself yawning even louder.

""I'd forgotten how tiring being eleven was,"" he grumbled. ""And I've got classes tomorrow.""

""Yes, however will you cope?""

Cedric flicked a minor jinx at him, which Harry deflected with a wave of his hand. ""Says the one who will get to stay in bed."" He grinned suddenly. ""Though we really should start up our morning sparring sessions again.""

""I've been looking forward to it,"" said Harry, and he actually meant it. It had been a constant of their lives for nearly fifty years, and he had missed it more than he could say. Then his mood darkened, and he sighed. ""And we are going to need it.""

Cedric said nothing, but Harry sensed rather than saw every muscle tense. He sighed again. ""We need to find out what happened to Voldemort.""

Cedric's eyes narrowed. ""You don't think he was destroyed.""

""Dark Lords aren't destroyed easily,"" said Harry quietly. ""We both know that. And by sacrifice born of a mother's love?""

""It does leave some unanswered questions,"" Cedric agreed. He cocked his head to one side, sharp eyes never leaving Harry's. ""You know Dumbledore would probably be able to tell you something.""

""He's more likely to send me back to the Muggles than tell me anything,"" Harry snapped. ""I'm nine, remember? No-one will tell me anything.""

He couldn't wait to grow up. Cedric nodded ruefully. ""It can be frustrating. My parents think I'm mature for my age, but they only take it so far."" He shook his head. ""Not that I can blame them. They'd think me insane.""

Harry sighed, already regretting his outburst. ""We could prove it, but...""

""It would cause more problems, especially for you,"" said Cedric immediately. ""We'll have to wait to establish ourselves before we think about anything else."" He sighed, and tilted his head back to stare at the ceiling. ""I hope the girls get here soon.""

Harry's chest ached, and he had to look away. ""At least we know they're all right, if they are here,"" he said quietly. ""They haven't felt the need to run away."" That was just him. Again.

Harry shook his head firmly. Self-pity was pointless. He stood up, and nudged Cedric with his toe. ""You should head back. Classes start in the morning.""

Cedric pulled a face. ""First year classes,"" he grumbled, as he dragged himself up. ""We're going to have to find something more interesting to do over the year.""

Harry smirked at him. ""I'm sure we can come up with something.""

Cedric grinned. ""Oh, I think so."" He turned towards the door, and then paused. ""It's good to see you again, Salazar,"" he said softly. ""We missed you.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. Cedric hesitated, then darted back back to pull him into a tight hug. ""Don't you dare get yourself killed again,"" he whispered into Harry's hair. ""I...we can't go through that. Not again.""

""I'll do my best,"" Harry said. Cedric's arms tightened, and Harry closed his eyes.

That was the only promise he could make.

Thanks for reading! Any feedback would be appreciated.

One of the nice things about the students being back, Harry reflected, was not having to Disillusion himself as he made his way through his castle. In his plain back robes and with his scar covered, he looked just like any other first year, albeit one that was a bit smaller than usual. The portraits took no notice of him, and the other students accepted him as one of them without question. He did have to be more careful with the teachers, but they were easy enough to avoid. He still had to Disillusion himself once he got to the library, or run the risk of getting drawn into conversation, but that was good practice.

It was in the library that Cedric found him after their first day of lessons. Harry had hidden himself among the advanced Runes books right at the back, and was happily catching up on everything he'd missed when his friend dropped his bag next to him.

""Binns has to go.""

Harry bade a silent farewell to Leonardo da Vinci, and set the book aside in favour of peering at his friend. ""Which one is that?""

""History of Magic,"" said Cedric shortly. ""It was the worst lesson I've ever had in my life.""

Harry frowned. History was too important a subject to be neglected. The Muggle-borns in particular needed to understand the world they had become a part of, but it was equally important for those raised in the magical world to get a proper, unbiased education.

""In what way?"" he asked. ""Was he a bad teacher, or...?""

""He spent an hour droning on and on about the goblin rebellions! He didn't introduce himself, he didn't lay out a proper lesson plan, he just started talking and didn't stop! I knew some of what he was talking about from my grandmother, but everyone else in there was completely lost. If I was a Muggle-born and that was my first exposure to magic I'd leave and never come back!""

""Calm down,"" Harry hissed. They were well away from curious ears, but Cedric's shouting wouldn't go unnoticed. Cedric lowered his voice, but he was still fuming.

""And he even manages to make goblin rebellions boring. I tell you, Harry, half the class was asleep within twenty minutes. He's the least inspiring person I've ever met! I'm amazed anyone passes any exam in that class, let alone their OWLs and NEWTs.""

Harry blinked, thrown by the sudden detour to animals. ""Excuse me?""

Cedric opened his mouth, then paused and shook his head. ""Sorry, keep forgetting you didn't grow up with this stuff. Students take OWL exams in fifth year, and more advanced NEWTs in seventh year."" Harry nodded in understanding, and Cedric returned to his diatribe, ""But hardly anyone takes History to NEWT level, and Binns' lessons are considered a chance to catch up on sleep. It cannot continue.""

Harry shook his head. ""I agree. We'll think of something."" He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""Any chance he could be persuaded to resign?""

Cedric gave him a peculiar look. ""If no-one has been able to manage it in the last two hundred years, I doubt we'll have much luck.""

Harry nodded, then blinked and stared at him. ""What?""

He had to have misheard. Cedric stared at him in complete confusion for a moment, then his expression cleared and he laughed. ""Oh, Harry.""

""What?"" Harry demanded. He raised his wand. ""I have enough control over my magic to hex you, you know.""

Cedric controlled himself, and shook his head. ""Sorry, I needed that. Harry, Binns is a ghost.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. ""Having a ghost teach History is actually quite a good idea.""

""Of course you would say that,"" said Cedric fondly, but his expression soon turned serious. ""The problem is, Binns refuses to accept that he is a ghost. As a result, he refuses to adapt to his circumstances in any way, including updating his curriculum. From what I can tell, he doesn't cover anything more recent than the mid-nineteenth century, not even the times of Grindelwald or Voldemort."" He ran a hand through his hair and sighed. ""And he really is a dreadful teacher.""

Harry tapped his wand thoughtfully against his knee. ""I wonder why Dumbledore hasn't asked him to move on. He must realise that our students' education is more important than being able to claim a ghost as a professor.""

""It's probably more a case of misplaced loyalty than any sense of prestige,"" Cedric suggested. ""But you're right. Things can't continue.""

There was a logical solution, and Harry didn't hesitate to suggest it. ""I'll have a talk with him. I will try to talk him into moving on first,"" he added quickly, when Cedric raised an eyebrow. ""I'll save those...other measures for later.""

""Like Peeves,"" Cedric muttered. ""I still can't believe no-one's gotten rid of him yet.""

Harry pulled a face. As amusing as they had found the poltergeist at first, he was absolutely impossible to control. At least he was as protective of the castle and students as they were, in his own unique way. Harry shook his head and returned to the matter at hand.

""When should we do it?""

Cedric pursed his lips thoughtfully. ""This weekend.""

""Thank you, that gives me so much time to prepare.""

Cedric nudged him with the toe of his boot. ""It also gives our students time to get a decent teacher this year. Besides, since when have you struggled to exorcise a ghost?""

""It's the principle of the thing,"" said Harry, with a sniff. ""Will you be helping?""

Cedric nodded. ""I'll find someone to cover for me. I doubt they'll suspect a first year anyway, but there's no point taking risks.""

Harry smirked at him. ""So you were listening all those years. I was beginning to wonder.""

Cedric shot a light hex at him, that Harry deflected with flick of his wand. It hit the nearest bookshelf, and they winced as one.

""Maybe we should stick to sparring in the Room of Requirement,"" said Cedric sheepishly. ""Rowena will murder us otherwise.""

Harry snorted in agreement, and cast a quick Cleaning Charm at the shelf. ""We'll add it to the list of things not to tell her."" He glanced round to check they hadn't attracted any unwanted attention, before returning to the topic of discussion. ""So Binns needs to go. Any other areas of concern?""

Cedric twirled his wand absently as he thought about it. ""I've had Flitwick, Sprout and McGonagall today, and they were all excellent. Astronomy isn't until Wednesday night, but I haven't heard any complaints about Sinistra."" He paused, and looked at Harry. ""The upper years did warn us all that Snape is incredibly biased towards Slytherin.""

Harry had to force his fingers to relax on his wand. ""I have observed him in passing,"" he said quietly. ""There is a darkness in him that I do not like."" He was silent for a moment, then sighed. ""I will try to observe his classes, and see how he interacts with each of the houses."" Some favouritism was understandable, but none of the other heads of house had the reputation that Snape did.

Cedric's lips thinned. ""Be careful. He isn't one to cross."" Harry nodded, and after a moment Cedric continued, ""I will try to talk to the older students about the elective teachers, when it won't be too suspicious, but I did hear a couple of people talking about taking Divination just because it was an easy OWL.""

Harry rolled his eyes. ""Students. I don't know why Divination was ever added to the course list, it's completely pointless for anyone other than a true Seer."" He shook his head. ""We might have to leave that for Rowena to deal with.""

""Neither of us would have any idea about assessing a teacher's competence in that area,"" Cedric agreed. He grinned suddenly. ""And I wouldn't want to deprive Ro of the satisfaction.""

Harry snorted. Their friend had always been rather eloquent on the subject of charlatans. Cedric's grin widened at the memory, but after a moment he shook his head. ""All right. That should be enough to keep us going for a little while."" He shot Harry an appraising look. ""Will you be up for sparring this evening?""

""If you think you can get away without being noticed,"" said Harry, with a nod. ""I know Helga's lot were always the most protective of new students.""

""Trust me, nothing has changed at all,"" said Cedric fondly. He slipped his wand back into its holster, and stood up. ""I should get back though. They'll be wondering where I got to.""

Harry didn't like having to catch odd moments with his best friend, but that couldn't be helped. He started to reach for another book, but suddenly paused. Something in Cedric's expression told him that there was something else. He raised an eyebrow, and after a moment of silent consideration, Cedric surrendered.

""Harry, Helena isn't the only one here.""

This time, Harry did Disillusion himself as he made his way through the corridors. It wasn't quite as effective as normal though. Try as he might, he couldn't keep his emotions, or his still-developing magic under control. He avoid the students as best he could, but he still saw the more sensitive among them start and shiver as he passed.

Under normal circumstances he would be appalled by his lack of control, but for the moment he simply didn't care. As far as he was concerned, the cause was sufficient.

Cedric hadn't tried to dissuade him from his course of action. In all likelihood his friend would have joined him, but this confrontation was better held while the students were at dinner in the Great Hall, and Cedric's absence would be noticed. Hufflepuffs were protective of their first years.

Besides, this conversation would go better with just the two of them.

A flicker from up ahead warned of Professors Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry paused just long enough to confirm with Hogwarts that his target hadn't left the dungeons before ducking into a secret passage. The students might notice his magic if they were paying particular attention, but a teacher certainly would. The slightly longer route was acceptable, if only because it gave Harry a chance to process the information.

It was no wonder Helena had been so reluctant to talk to him.

The dungeons were deserted by the time Harry got there. All the Slytherins were in the Great Hall, and Harry took a moment to catch his breath before heading into the labyrinth of passages. The familiar surroundings soothed him, and his fury cooled to something quieter, but no less dangerous. He was Slytherin, and would deal with this as he ought.

The Bloody Baron was exactly where Hogwarts had told Harry he would be. He recognised the little alcove immediately, and nostalgia threatened to overwhelm him. He cancelled the Disillusionment Charm with a thought, sat on the stone bench, and looked at the spirit of the man who had been one of his first students.

""I did not expect to see you again, Edmund.""

Edmund gave no sign of having heard, but after a long moment he turned blank silver eyes to Harry. ""Likewise. Sir.""

That answered the question of whether Helena had spoken to him. Harry nodded, but kept his own face expressionless. ""Tell me.""

His expression was one thing, his magic quite another. Edmund flinched, and looked away. ""I refused to listen. I ignored everything you taught me. I was a fool.""

""Foolish was continuing to pursue Helena, despite our objections,"" said Harry coldly. ""What you did-""

""Was unforgivable,"" the ghost interrupted. ""I know, sir."" He looked back, and this time the pain was clearly visible in his black eyes. ""I was blind with rage. I regretted it the moment it was done, and I knew there was no way to atone for it."" He stared round at the alcove where Salazar had set with him, and where he had set with younger Slytherins in turn. ""I returned in penance, and here I will remain a long as Hogwarts endures.""

Harry nodded slowly. ""And Helena?""

Edmund's face twisted in ancient grief. ""She returned for the same reason, but it was too late. Her mother..."" His voice faltered, and he looked down for a moment before continuing, ""She needs forgiveness, but she cannot move on. She is afraid.""

Harry closed his eyes. He had half-expected as much. He shook his head, and looked back at Edmund. ""And now?""

If ghosts could pale, Harry had no doubt that Edmund would have, but he met Harry's gaze without flinching. ""She will wait for her mother. She has much to say to her. As do I.""

He fell silent, but there was a tension to him that told Harry that he had more yet to say. Harry waited, and finally the ghost spoke again, ""And I failed you.""

""You did,"" said Harry. He tried to keep his voice level, but his magic crackled in the air. ""I trusted you to protect her.""

Edmund flinched, and looked away. ""Everything changed after...after your death,"" he whispered. Harry's stomach twisted painfully, but the Baron wasn't finished, ""They all changed. The students didn't know what to do."" His mouth twisted into a bitter smile. ""Neither did I."" His shoulders slumped, and he bowed his head. ""We missed you.""

Harry didn't reply. He couldn't. Even after years of being with his friends, and being known and respected as one of the founders of Hogwarts, he had ever quite been able to abandon the fear of being forgotten. He had dreaded the thought of his death passing unnoticed. Years with the Dursleys had only reinforced those feelings.

He really should have known better. Hogwarts was a steady presence in the back of his mind, and he thought of Cedric's rib-cracking hugs, and managed to clear his throat.

""Likewise.""

Edmund relaxed a tiny fraction, and Harry knew he understood. He took a moment to collect himself, then coughed. ""What is your role within Slytherin House?""

The Baron paused, but more in thought than out of a reluctance to answer. ""I try to guide them, as you guided us. I support them when faced with the other students."" He paused, and then there was reluctance. ""But...things are not easy for Slytherins. And not all of it is undeserved.""

The thought sent a familiar pulse of anger through Harry, and he checked himself when Edmund twitched. ""I am aware. And when I am old enough, I will set things right.""

Edmund said nothing, but he bowed with every ounce of his old respect, and Harry let himself relax a little. He could not change the past, and he did not know if he could forgive. All he could do was help the people he loved as best he could.

""Rowena will come,"" he said quietly. ""You will wait for her, and you will accept whatever judgement she proclaims.""

Edmund just bowed again. Harry sighed. He didn't envy his friend at all. He shook his head firmly; Rowena needed the truth, and they all needed some form of closure. In any case, Rowena wasn't here yet. They would deal with this mess when the time came.

In the meantime, there was another ghostly problem to deal with.

""Stupefy!""

Harry grinned a vicious grin and launched himself to one side. The red light missed him by inches, and a rapid Shield Charm caught the two the first one had been herding him towards. He retaliated with a furry of curses, but his opponent countered with a shield of his own and started to advance, pressing his offensive all the way. Harry backed up, still casting as fast as he could manage, but the strain on his young magic was becoming difficult to bear. A ridiculously overpowered Disarming Spell sent his wand spinning from his hand, and him crashing to the floor.

""Ow.""

Cedric's face swam into view, his expression decidedly sheepish. ""That might have been a bit much.""

Harry glared at him. ""You think?"" 

His lungs were still burning, and his muscles felt like jelly as he accepted his friend's help up. He leaned forward, hands resting on his knees as he tried to catch his breath. He had forgotten just how intense these workouts could get.

Though at least Cedric was breathing heavily too. At the beginning of the week Cedric had been defeating him with embarrassing ease, but sparring twice a day and training while Cedric was in lessons had paid off. Harry still had a lot of work to do, but his magic was rapidly getting used to combat again.

""That was longer than last time,"" Cedric said. ""You'll be back to your normal standards in no time.""

Harry gave him a tired smile. ""How did you manage to stay in shape?""

Cedric shrugged. ""As much physical training and wandless exercises as I could get away with.""

Harry grunted. Regularly missing meals and sleeping in a cupboard weren't conducive to building up decent muscle tone. From the way Cedric's expression had darkened the same thought was on his mind, but he knew better than to bring it up. Instead, his friend gave him a slightly forced smile.

""Though you're going to be faster than ever, I think.""

Harry just nodded. Dodging Dudley had been easier than trying to defend himself. Besides, just being able to run was enough of a novelty that he had indulged himself whenever possible. He still went out for a run round the grounds while the students were in their lessons. He couldn't spend all day reading, and the exercise would be invaluable for when he did get into a real fight.

Cedric still looked faintly murderous though, so Harry dragged himself back to the present.

""I hope so."" He stretched his aching muscles, and looked at his friend. ""So. Binns?""

Cedric paused, but moved on from plotting revenge on the Dursleys with a visible effort and a slightly sheepish look. ""Right. Everyone in Hufflepuff thinks I'm with the twins, and I told Fred and George that someone had told me something about the kitchens being near the Hufflepuff Basement, so that should keep them out of the way."" He glanced at his watch, and frowned. ""For an hour or two, at least.""

Harry raised an eyebrow at him. ""You're really going to subject the house-elves to those two?""

Cedric rolled his eyes. ""They aren't that bad.""

Harry hummed non-committedly. The twins had been at Hogwarts barely a week, and they had already caused more chaos than everyone else in the castle put together, save Peeves of course.

""They aren't!""

""If you say so,"" said Harry dryly. He retrieved his wand, and winced at the headache that had built up. He was using a lot of magic for someone of his age, but Harry knew his own capabilities. More importantly, he couldn't afford to wait.

""Harry?""

Harry shook his head. ""Just a headache."" His scar seemed to tingle and he rubbed at it rather irritably. ""And my scar seems to react to magic.""

Cedric frowned. ""You've never mentioned it before.""

""It doesn't happen often,"" said Harry. ""I think it's because the Room is so saturated with magic."" Hogwarts itself was one of the most magical places in the world, and the Room of Requirement had been the focus of some of their most delicate and complex spells.

Cedric's expression though, had darkened.

""Or your scar is reacting to something else.""

Harry paused. He hadn't considered that. The perfectly controlled room suddenly felt very cold. ""Cursed scars often react to the presence of Dark magic.""

The two of them looked at each other, then glanced around as one.

""Hogwarts,"" said Cedric evenly. ""What else have students been leaving in this room?""

There was an uncomfortably long pause before Hogwarts replied. 'I do not know.'

Cedric paled, and Harry had to take a steadying breath. They should have realised as much. Hogwarts was powerful, but she wasn't omniscient. ""Can you show us?""

This time there was no reply, but the room shivered and rippled and reformed. Harry stared around, and swallowed. ""Well, I know what I'll be doing for the next couple of years.""

Piles of rubbish lay heaped in rough rows as far as the eye could see. Some of it looked vaguely useful, like old books and robes, but there was also broken furniture, and scraps of parchment, and a multitude of magical items that Harry couldn't even begin to name. Cedric stared at the mess and shook his head.

""Wow,"" he breathed. ""Yeah. This ought to keep you busy.""

Harry pulled a face, but he couldn't bring himself to mind too much. There was only so much training he could do, particularly with Cedric in lessons, and even he couldn't just spend two years reading. Clearing up the Room of Requirement would be a suitable distraction.

Being able to locate and isolate anything that might be a potential danger to their students was just an added bonus.

'I would appreciate it,' said Hogwarts. 'No-one has done a proper clean out in centuries. The house-elves do not like to come here.'

Harry nodded. ""I wouldn't ask them to. If there are Dark items in here then I don't want them exposed to them."" In the distance a one of the stacks slowly toppled sideways and scattered on the floor with a crash, and he sighed. ""Rowena will have a fit."" The Room had been her pride and joy.

Cedric clapped him on the shoulder. ""You'd better work hard then. Of course, I would be more than willing to help out, if not for those pesky lessons...""

Harry rolled his eyes. ""I'm telling Ro you said that."" He took another long look at the chaos, then shook his head. ""We can deal with this later. We need to get moving.""

Cedric nodded, expression immediately turning serious. ""Where is Binns?""

There was a slight pause before Hogwarts replied. 'In his office. But you will be good to him, won't you? He has served well and faithfully for many years.""

Harry was inclined to dispute the serving well part, but he couldn't deny Binns' loyalty, and nodded. ""Of course.""

The two of them left the Room of Requirement and made their way down to Binns' office. They passed a few students, but neither of them paid the first year and apparent first year any attention. Harry used the trip to review the spells he would need if the ghost proved particularly stubborn, but he didn't miss the fact that Cedric's usually cheerful face was very grim. His friend caught his eye and grimaced.

""I'm not looking forward to this.""

Harry raised an eyebrow, and he flushed slightly. ""And no, it's not because he's a ghost. Honestly, Sal, I got over that before we returned to Britain.""

""I know,"" Harry drawled. ""But sometimes I need to remind myself that there really were things you were scared of."" Cedric rolled his eyes, and Harry smiled slightly before returning to the subject at hand. ""I don't particularly like it either, but we must. Our students deserve better.""

""I know,"" said Cedric, with a sigh. ""But still..."" He trailed off, and shook his head. ""Let's just get this over with.""

Harry eyed him for a moment, but he had always known when Godric didn't want to talk, and Cedric was even easier to read, so he kept his peace. He would have plenty of time to deal with whatever was bothering his closest friend once they were done.

Besides, he wanted to get this over with too.

Fortunately, Binns was in his office. It took him several minutes to realise that they were at the door, and even once he called them in he bore an expression of complete confusion. Harry supposed he wasn't a teacher who often received visitors outside of class.

""Yes, Diggly?""

""Diggory, sir,"" Cedric corrected gently.

""Of course, Diggersby."" Pale eyes turned to Harry, and narrowed. ""And you, I do not know.""

""Potter, sir,"" said Harry. Cedric shot him a sharp look, but Harry gave a slight shrug. One way or another, Binns would not be spreading that information. Binns though, just gave a slow blink.

""Porter, yes. I have taught many Porters.""

Or being mistaken for one of his ancestors also worked well enough. It also reinforced the impressions that Harry had got from Cedric and Hogwarts. Binns could not remain as a member of staff. Cedric coughed, and took a step forward.

""You have been here for a long time, Professor Binns.""

Binns started slightly in midair, as though he had forgotten that they were they. ""I suppose so, Digbeth.""

Cedric grimaced, but something about the ghost's manner caught Harry's attention, and he moved up to stand next to Cedric. ""You do not sound particularly excited about it.""

Binns shrugged. ""I am a teacher. Hogwarts is my life. Where else would I go?""

""Hogwarts was your life,"" said Harry gently. ""And I am sorry, Professor, but that life is over.""

Binns was completely still, but his head turned and for the first time he looked Harry straight in the eye. ""Over?""

Harry nodded. ""Is this really what you wish to spend eternity doing? Talking about the same old wars and rebellions to an ever-changing sea of faces? Never seeing what lies behind these walls, on the greatest adventure one can take?"" He stepped forward, ignoring the tension radiating from Cedric. ""You deserve better than this, Professor.""

Binns shook his head. ""No. No...I...This is what I chose.""

Cedric made a muffled noise, but Harry caught a flash of something behind the words, and his eyes narrowed. ""And have you since come to regret that choice?""

Binns held his gaze, and something resembling passion finally entered his expression. ""The choice was made.""

""And were you ever offered another?"" Harry asked. ""Or the choice to end this half existence?""

Binns did not reply, and Harry nodded. He had wondered as much. Wizards were not very good at change, especially when it came to time honoured traditions. Cedric looked between the two of them, mouth slightly open, before he finally turned back to Binns.

""If you did have the choice,"" he said gently, ""what would you like to do?""

For several long minutes, there was no reply. Harry was in no hurry. This was one of those decisions that should not, and would not be taken lightly. He had said his piece. He could only hope that it would be enough.

Binns stared at him for a long minute, then raised his head. He peered round at the stone walls as if seeing them for the first time, and his mouth twisted into a faint smile.

""I used to be able to remember the name of every student I ever taught. Their houses, their hopes, and dreams. Many visited me after leaving Hogwarts."" He paused, and his eyes came to rest on the two boys. ""What are your names?""

There was an edge to his voice that had not been there previously, and Harry bowed. ""My name is Harry Potter, and this is Cedric Diggory.""

Cedric smiled. ""It is a pleasure, sir.""

Misty eyes peered at them, and Binns slowly shook his head. ""I wish I could say the same,"" he murmured.

Cedric frowned, but kept quiet when Harry elbowed him. Harry himself met the ghost's eyes steadily. ""Is this the existence you want, Professor?""

""I never wanted this,"" said Binns quietly.

Harry tightened his grip on the wand in his pocket. It would not be long now. Cedric glanced at him, his face a mask of compassion, but made no move to interfere. Binns took a long, final look round, and drifted down to face Harry directly.

""End this, Harry Potter. Let me rest.""

Harry drew his wand, and bowed. ""Thank you for all that you have done for Hogwarts, Professor Binns,"" he said. ""You have served well.""

He couldn't help but let some of his old authority enter his voice. Binns' eyes widened, and even more so when Harry started to gather his magic. He glanced at Cedric, and then back at Harry, and his wrinkled face creased into a faint smile. 

""It appears I will miss a very interesting few years,"" he murmured. ""But then, I will have adventures of my own."" He bowed back. ""Farewell, Harry Potter.""

Harry took a deep breath, and began the incantation. A deep blue light began to emanate from the tip of his wand, faint at first, but growing steadily brighter. He concentrated on the rush of magic, and only looked up when the spell reached its climax.

There was a smile on Binns' face as he looked back, and then he was gone. 

The light faded, and Harry slowly lowered his wand. For a moment he stood there, then shook himself and glanced at Cedric.

""We should go,"" he said quietly. ""We don't want people to notice your absence.""

Cedric stared at him for a long second, then shook his head. He left the room without another word. Harry took a final glance at the spot where Binns had disappeared before following.

Cedric was very subdued as they made their way back through the corridors. Harry didn't feel much like talking himself, and it wasn't until they were back in the Room of Requirement that Cedric finally looked at him.

""He was so different,"" he said quietly. ""From Helena, and the Friar, and..."" He trailed off, with a grimace.

Harry sighed. ""He had lost his purpose. Helena and Edmund cannot find peace, and so cannot rest, and the other ghosts are much more involved with their students. For now, they are content.""

It was not an existence he would ever choose for himself, the very idea was unbearable, but he had seen how the ghosts of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff still took pleasure from their existence. Cedric still looked pale though, and Harry nudged him.

""Binns chose to move on.""

Cedric snorted. ""After you gave him so much choice in the matter."" Harry drew back, but Cedric was already shaking his head. ""I'm sorry. You remain as persuasive as ever.""

Harry eyed him for a moment, before deciding to let it go. His friend had always taken a different approach to himself. It was one of the reasons they worked so well together. Instead he leaned back in his chair.

""You can stop going easy on me when we spar tomorrow.""

Cedric blinked, then finally a faint smile touched his face. ""If you insist.""

He met Harry's eyes briefly in silent acknowledgement, then sighed and pushed himself up. ""I should go and rescue the house-elves. Two hours of dealing with the Weasley Twins is enough to test the most patient of people.""

Harry squashed the by now familiar but still unwelcome surge of jealousy and nodded. ""Good. They'll be missing you soon.""

Cedric clapped him on the shoulder. ""Tomorrow morning then. We still need to talk about Snape.""

Harry pulled a face, and Cedric laughed. ""I feel exactly the same way.""

Harry watched him go with a smile, feeling better than he had in a while. They had finally done something that would benefit their school. Hopefully it wouldn't be the only such intervention.

Speaking of which... Harry sighed, and tilted his head back.

""All right,"" he said out loud. ""Let's get started on all this rubbish.""

A moment later he was surrounded by a millennia's worth of forgotten belongings, and he sighed.

""The things I do for this school.""

Cedric stared at the silver ornament, frowned, tilted his head to one side, and squinted some more.

""Is it a duck?""

Harry lowered the item and gave him a look. ""A duck.""

Cedric threw up his hands. ""I don't know! You're the one who's been looking into the thing, why don't you tell me?""

""Why do you think I was asking?"" Harry shot back. ""Either someone got bored halfway through, or they were far too drunk to be working with precious metals."" He paused. ""However, it does appear to be solid silver, so we can always melt it down and use it for something else.""

Cedric watched him send it to the part of the Room they had set aside for potentially useful things, and stared at round at the stacks. ""Well, you're making progress. You should be done by, I don't know, the time we finish Hogwarts?""

Harry pulled a face at him. If the last three weeks had taught him anything, it was that this was not a job for one person. ""Ro was always better at this sort of thing than me,"" he muttered. ""It'll be quicker with all four of us.""

Cedric eyed him a moment, then grabbed his cloak from the back of the chair. ""Come on.""

""What-""

""You've been stuck inside all day, and Helga always said that wasn't good for you.""

""I went for a run this morning,"" Harry shot back, but his protestations were half-hearted at best. After being stuck in the castle all day he was more than ready for some fresh air.

""Feels good to have so much energy, doesn't it,"" said Cedric, as they made their way down the stairs.

Harry snorted. For all that being eleven again was incredibly frustrating, it did have its benefits. Even with Helga's skill at healing, some wounds just didn't heal completely. To be free of all the old aches and pains was a blessing.

Sneaking out of the castle wasn't difficult for the people who had made it, and the two of them were soon strolling round the edge of the lake in companionable silence. The temperature was starting to fall as winter set in, but not unbearably so, and the dreaded snow had yet to set in.

They had made a complete circuit around the lake when Cedric finally spoke.

""Have you thought about what we talked about before.""

Harry sighed, his good mood plummeting. ""Of course I have."" He kicked at a stone, pausing to watch the ripples it made as it disappeared into the water. ""He is clearly a terrible teacher.""

""But he keeps the students safe,"" said Cedric. ""And the ones that enjoy Potions and can work with him go on to do very well indeed.""

""But that's not the way it should be,"" Harry insisted. ""It's fine to be able to get good work out of those who have the enthusiasm and aptitude, but children shouldn't be terrified of going to a class because they know the teacher is going to mock their every effort.""

Cedric's jaw tightened. They had hit upon the crux of the matter there. Severus Snape was an incredibly talented Potions Master, and his NEWT level students were a credit to the school, but the man was a truly abysmal teacher for the average student.

An owl flew over their heads and Harry tilted his head to watch it. It disappeared into the clouds, and he sighed.

""I don't know what we can do about him.""

It was a difficult thing to admit. As nice as it was to be a child again, the lack of influence over his beloved school was becoming increasingly draining. In spite of all his memories and knowledge, there was only so much a nine year old could do.

From the expression on Cedric's face, being an eleven year old wasn't much better.

""Nothing, at the moment,"" he grunted. He leaned against a tree and stared out over the lake. ""I've talked to the older students. His behaviour has earned complaints in the past, but nothing has ever come of them.""

Harry gritted his teeth. ""So all we can do is wait.""

The words left a bitter taste in his mouth, but Salazar had always been a pragmatist.

And he was very good at biding his time.

Minerva settled herself into an armchair and allowed herself a contented sigh. Her cup of tea was warm in her hands, it's fragrance soothing as only tea could be, and for one blissful moment, Minerva was able to put the stress of dealing with four hundred magical teenagers aside. Across the table, Filius and Septima were discussing spellcrafting, with occasional input from Severus, while Pomona and Poppy debated the optimal conditions for the harvesting of dittany.

All conversation faded into respectful silence the moment Albus Dumbledore entered the room though. The Headmaster smiled round the room, but the customary twinkle was missing from his eyes.

""Good afternoon,"" he greeted them. He settled himself in the chair at the head of the table, and steepled his fingers. ""I will not keep you long. I merely wish to inform you of the results of our investigation.""

Minerva set her cup back in its saucer, and leaned forwards. Albus' smile faded. ""Neither myself, nor Head Auror Scrimgeour were able to find any clue as to the identity of the exorcist of Professor Binns.""

Minerva closed her eyes as murmuring erupted around her. She and Albus had spent many hours discussing possible theories, but the list of people who could exorcise a ghost without leaving a trace, let alone enter and leave Hogwarts undetected was short to say the least. No student could have the power or skill to challenge a ghost of Binns' age, and certainly no other teacher would dream of doing so. Albus caught her eye, and raised a hand for silence.

""However, I did invite an representative from the Spirits Division to inspect the scene of the crime."" He paused, probably to build up tension. Albus always did have a flair for the dramatic. ""She was able to identify the spell used as one that required the ghost's agreement in order to send them on.""

There was a stunned silence, then a booming voice rang out. ""Absurd!""

Minerva wasn't the only one to wince at the volume. Herbert Runcorn was a perfectly adequate Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, but he didn't seem to comprehend the notion of an indoor voice. His perpetually red face was set in a scowl as he folded his arms. ""Why would any ghost choose to be exorcised? Binns has taught at this school for generations, for Merlin's sake.""

""Perhaps a better question would be why did the perpetrator choose a spell that required Binns' agreement?"" said Filius thoughtfully. ""It is far simpler to force a spirit on than to convince them to move on of their own accord.""

Runcorn shook his head with a snort. ""Must have lacked the strength. That would explain why they took such pains not to be noticed, they never would have prevailed in a struggle.""

""So we have a magically weak witch or wizard capable of infiltrating Hogwarts, convincing a strongly established ghost to depart, and vanishing without a trace?"" Minerva summarised. She wasn't quite able to keep her disbelief from her voice, and saw her own doubts mirrored on many of her colleagues' faces. Albus sighed.

""I have relayed our theories to the Auror Department, and they will be looking into the matter. In the meantime, I have been searching for a replacement for History of Magic.""

""Good,"" said Minerva firmly. She and the others had been taking it in turns to cover those sessions, with help from the few seventh years who had actually continued the subject to NEWT level, but they really had enough to be getting on with with their own classes.

Albus nodded. ""I have written to my old friend, Bathilda Bagshot. Her great-great-great,"" He paused a moment, eyes twinkling. ""Now, was there another great?""

""Albus,"" said Minerva dryly. She saw Filius cover a smile with a hand, and Septima and Severus exchange withering looks, but Albus' eyes twinkled even more brightly.

""Of course, Minerva. In any case, her niece, Belinda, received an Outstanding in her History of Magic NEWT with us.""

""Yes, she was one of mine,"" said Pomona. ""She's spent the last four years at the University of Alexandria, she still writes every few months.""

Minerva nodded thoughtfully. She too could remember young Belinda, and a more different personality to Binns could scarcely be imagined. ""And she would be willing to cover for the rest of the term?""

Albus inclined his head. ""I am still waiting for her confirmation owl, but she indicated that she would be happy to fill in for the rest of the term. She would be more than welcome to stay on, of course, but should she choose to return to research I will have ample time to find a replacement.""

There was a murmur of approval. Professor Runcorn let out a braying laugh. ""And you thought it was the Defence teachers that you would have problems keeping!""

Filius leaned away, rubbing his ear wearily, but Albus just smiled. ""Indeed, I do hope this will be the end of our staffing troubles for the year.""

""Unless whoever disposed of Binns so efficiently turns their attention elsewhere.""

Severus did have a knack for lowering the mood, Minerva reflected. Albus' eyes narrowed. ""They were able to successfully infiltrate Hogwarts, and yet their sole aim appears to have been to exorcise a single ghost. I doubt that they will return.""

Severus acknowledged the point with a nod, but he wasn't quite finished. ""And yet we have no clues as to their identity. Or what their purpose is.""

Albus was silent for several seconds, and Minerva had to fight back a shiver at the ice in his eyes. It was easy to forget that the eccentric old man was one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Eventually though, Albus visibly relaxed.

""Well, we will remain alert. With time and patience, I am sure that the truth will be revealed."" He leaned back in his chair, and favoured them all with a genial smile. ""And on to more pleasant matters. How are our new first years getting on?""

Pomona brightened, and leaned forwards. ""Very well, as far as I can tell. One of mine, Cedric Diggory, has settled in marvellously.""

Minerva had taken note of that boy herself, and said so. ""He has been at the top of his class from the first day. I've never seen anyone master the initial lessons so quickly.""

""His Charms work is equally impressive,"" Filius chipped in. ""His questions and essays show an almost intuitive understanding of the fundamentals, and he's already starting to draw upon theories I don't usually touch on until third year.""

Runcorn harrumphed loudly. ""Lad's a bit too enthusiastic in my classes. Still, I wouldn't mind hexing those twins myself sometimes, and he's executing every jinx perfectly after a single demonstration.""

Pomona was smiling widely enough that her cheeks had to be hurting. Minerva raised an enquiring eyebrow at Severus, who merely snorted.

""The boy is not entirely incompetent.""

Pomona rolled her eyes. ""Thank you for that assessment, Severus."" Ignoring his sneer, she turned to Albus. ""In all seriousness, Cedric is picking up the material remarkably quickly. We may have to think about some more advanced instruction in the future.""

Albus stroked his beard thoughtfully, and nodded. ""Let us see how he does this year. It is not healthy for students to spend their most enjoyable years trying to cram as much information into their heads as fast as possible.""

Pomona was the first to voice her agreement, and Albus turned twinkling eyes to Minerva. ""And I hear the young Weasley twins are making their mark.""

""The brats are a menace!"" Severus exploded.

""They have yet to fail a single exercise in my classes,"" Minerva shot back. Not that she couldn't understand where her colleague was coming from, but it was only fair to let Albus get an accurate picture.

""They are disrespectful, arrogant, foolhardy-""

""Now, Severus, my boy-""

""Severus, you can hardly complain about the Weasley twins when I spent two hours stripping down brooms after those second years of yours tried to sneak in extra practices,"" Rolanda put in.

""That is completely beside the point!""

Minerva raised an eyebrow at the developing discussion, but contented herself with pouring another cup of tea. At least the rest of the term could only be more peaceful.

Fred looked at George. George looked at Fred.

""You know what I'm thinking?""

""I'm quite sure I do.""

""I think further investigations are necessary, George.""

""I couldn't agree more, Fred.""

Fred leaned on the bannister, and watched the two small figures do a not quite good enough job of sneaking into the school undetected. ""Where has old Ceddy been without us?""

George's attention was on the unfamiliar black-haired boy with his friend. Even as he watched, the two separated, and the stranger was swallowed up in the shadows of the dungeons. ""He's been keeping secrets from us,"" he said quietly.

The two looked at each other again, then back at Cedric, who was making his way towards the passage leading to the Hufflepuff Basement. Cheerful whistling floated up to them, and George elbowed his twin.

""C'mon. Let's get back to the Common Room.""

Fred turned to follow him, his brown eyes gleaming. ""Yes, let's. We've got a project to get started.""

Albus stroked Fawkes' brilliant plumage, and stared at the array of instruments on his desk, and sighed.

""It has been an eventful few months, my friend,"" he murmured.

He had never anticipated losing Cuthbert Binns. The ghost had been a fixture at Hogwarts for centuries. The very idea that someone might exorcise him had been unthinkable, and yet it had happened. That whoever had done so had managed to enter and leave Hogwarts undetected only made matters worse. Amelia Bones had not been pleased, and Albus had been forced to disclose more details about Hogwarts' wards and their security in order to placate her. It was extremely fortunate that whoever was responsible had chosen to only persuade Binns, and had not interacted in any way with any other staff or students.

And that wasn't the only issue of concern. There was still that unexplained explosion of magic over the summer, the curious excitement of the house-elves, the air of almost tangible expectancy that seemed to come from the very castle.

There was the disappearance of Harry Potter.

The monitor on Albus' desk hadn't changed since that fateful morning. Harry was still safe and well, but beyond that, Albus knew nothing.

Albus had even made discreet inquiries among Lily and James' old friends. If anyone had gone to check on the boy, and for some reason decided to remove him from the Dursleys' custody, it was likely to be someone acquainted with the couple, but all of Albus' most subtle probing had resulted in failure.

In the case of Remus Lupin, Albus was beginning to suspect that he had actually done more harm than good. His old student had been both surprised by and wary of the sudden interest, and Albus' inability to answer any of Remus' own questions had caused some understandable frustration. Albus could only hope that the young man wouldn't take matters into his own hands.

Fawkes let out a reassuring trill, and Albus smiled down at his friend.

""I am getting far too old for this.""

After all the excitement of the start of term, the next few weeks were almost boring in comparison. Harry trained with Cedric, read books, and attempted to clear out the piles of useless items in the Room of Requirement, but despite his best efforts none of it was enough to keep his mind occupied.

Eventually, the frustration became too much.

""Where have you been?""

Cedric's cheeks were flushed with excitement, but he offered Harry an apologetic smile. ""Sorry, Harry. The twins were waiting for me again.""

Harry scowled. The Weasley twins had somehow caught on to the fact that Cedric wasn't always where he said he was, and had spent the past month trying to find out what was going on. Having finally realised that Cedric was far too good at disappearing during the day, they had begun waiting for him by the Hufflepuff Basement each morning, which made it very difficult for Cedric to get to the Room of Requirement for their morning sparring sessions. With their time together limited as it was, the interference was getting on Harry's nerves.

Oblivious to Harry's rising irritation, Cedric was still chatting away happily, ""It's pretty impressive actually, they've already found two of our secret passages. I think Bill did give them some hints, but I'm sure none of our first years ever found any that fast.""

""Probably because ours were too busy with useful things,"" Harry muttered. ""Like their studies, and trying not to get burnt alive by Muggles.""

Cedric's eyes narrowed. He studied Harry for a long minute, then sighed, and folded his arms. ""All right, what's the matter with you?""

Harry stared hard at the open book in his hands. ""Nothing."" He turned a page, only to have the book abruptly Summoned out of his hands. ""Don't do that to Rowena or she will hex you. Actually do it, I could use the laugh.""

Cedric didn't take the bait. He set the book carefully on the desk before looking back at Harry. ""You think I'm spending too much time with my other friends.""

The word choice was deliberate, and Harry wasn't quite able to hide his frown. Cedric sighed again, and ran a hand through his dark hair. ""They're my classmates, Harry. I can't exactly avoid them.""

Harry choked back a biting retort with an effort, and instead Summoned his book back. ""I know that.""

Cedric sighed, then came to crouch in front of Harry. ""I know this is hard for you,"" he said gently. ""I'd hate being cooped up in here too, especially after...after everything, but as much as I want to spend more time here, I can't. Fred and George already know that something is going on.""

""Then you should have been more careful,"" Harry snapped.

Cedric's face flushed. ""Don't judge me, Sal. You're not the one having to pretend to be an eleven year old every day!""

Harry blinked, but Cedric had apparently reached the limits of his own patience. ""You don't have to sit in class and act like you couldn't teach the entire curriculum. You don't have to think about every word you say in case someone notices you're hiding an entire other life. You're not the one juggling two different lives while worrying about whether the other two most important people in your life will ever join you!""

Harry was on his feet before he even knew what was happening. ""Don't you dare think I've forgotten them,"" he snarled. ""At least you have some distractions. All I have is the knowledge that I can't leave here because I have literally nowhere to go, my parents are dead, my only other living relatives despise me, and my only friend has new and better friends to spend his time with.""

The temperature in the room rose abruptly, and Harry knew he had gone too far but he suddenly didn't care. Cedric's eyes met his, wide with hurt and anger, but then Harry was gone, down into the Chamber of Secrets, where Cedric knew better than to follow him. The Chamber had always been Salazar's sanctuary, and both of them knew better than to seek the other out when tempers had risen so high.

Harry stood still for several seconds, trying to control the emotions swirling within him. His anger with his friend was rapidly being replaced with shame. Cedric was allowed to have other friends. He needed to have other friends. Harry had always been a loner, and was quite happy with Cedric and Hogwarts, but Godric had always thrived on company. He was at his best when he was supporting and encouraging others.

Jealousy was not an attractive character trait, Harry reflected bitterly. He slumped against one of the ancient columns, uncaring of the damp seeping into his robes as guilt settled heavy in his stomach.

He had sworn that this life would be different, and yet here he was, as self-destructive as before.

Hogwarts' presence brushed his mind in quiet reassurance, but as much as Harry appreciated the gesture he couldn't respond to it. He tilted his head back against the rough stone, letting his gaze wander over his grandfather's carved features.

""I am sorry,"" he whispered.

If his grandfather knew what had become of their family name...

Harry sighed, and pushed himself back to his feet. It was easier to think on the move in this life. He paced down the broad walkway, ignoring the foul-smelling puddles, and trying to let go of his anger. The Weasleys were not a threat to him. He and Godric shared a bond forged over a lifetime. A new childhood friendship was nothing to be jealous of.

Salazar had never been very rational when it came to his friends. Harry had to be better.

He stopped at the base of his grandfather's statue. For a moment he stood still, paralysed by indecision. His mind was clear again, but he wasn't ready to face Cedric just yet. The other boy would probably have gone to classes by now anyway. There was nothing urgent demanding his attention, and he needed a break from digging through the rubbish in the Room of Requirement.

Harry sighed, and laid a hand on the base of his grandfather's statue. A pulse of magic released the wards, and he watched in approval as the stone slab slid aside as smoothly as it had done a thousand years ago. The passage was dark and smelled strongly of damp, but a Lumos and Bubble-Head Charm dealt with that. A minute later he emerged into a much larger cavern, and he stopped short.

Issa had grown. Salazar had expected that. Herpo the Foul's Basilisk had lived for hundreds of years, and had continued to grow fairly steadily all that time.

Seeing it in person was something else.

Harry rested a trembling hand against the green scales. Issa had to be at least sixty feet long. Her eyes were closed, and judging by the layer of dust coating her coils it had been some time since she was last out and about. Harry could hardly blame her. For one thing, it was hard to imagine the amount she would have to eat to remain as active as she had been when she was the size of his arm.

Harry sighed, and stepped back. Issa would wake in time. She was alive and well, and ready to be called upon to defend Hogwarts. That was enough for now.

It didn't matter that the ache in his chest was growing more painful. Harry took a deep breath. He needed to talk to Cedric, but Cedric was in class, and Harry had to do something, anything, to keep his mind off how much of a mess he was. He started to retrace his steps through to the main chamber, then paused.

The rest of the side passages were free of dust.

Harry frowned. He had set various spells to try to keep this place in an acceptable creation, but not even his spellwork should have lasted for hundreds of years. Someone had cast new ones, and fairly recently.

Harry bit his lip. He had shown Murtagh the Chamber, and his nephew had sworn to make sure it was maintained, but there were items in here that had the power to cause unimaginable amounts of harm. They had been locked away behind the strongest wards he could create, but if that magic had degraded too...

At least he had something to keep him occupied until Cedric finished classes.

It took all of Remus Lupin's considerable self-control to contain his fury until after Petunia shut the door. He hadn't known Lily's sister well, for some strange reason Lily had been reluctant to let them spend much time with her, but he had expected better than this.

How bad must things have been for Harry to have run away?

Petunia had told him everything. Remus had even detected a trace of guilt in her eyes, despite her clipped tones, but he couldn't find it in him to have much sympathy for her. It had been an effort just to control his temper, but getting sent to Azkaban for hexing Muggles would hardly help Harry.

Remus' steps faltered. From what little he'd been able to get out of Albus he knew that Harry wasn't with any of James or Lily's other friends. But there was one person that Albus might have missed.

Even after eight years, thinking of Sirius Black was enough to make Remus' vision tint red. He hadn't been able to see Black after his arrest for fear of murdering him on the spot. The very thought that their oldest friend could betray them like that...

With an effort, Remus forced his mind back to the matter at hand. Black had been Voldemort's right-hand man, but Remus knew him. Sirius had always been impetuous and headstrong, but he had never been stupid. He must have known that there was a possibility that Voldemort could be defeated. There was a chance that he had laid contingency plans.

Remus let out a long breath. It was a long shot. Black almost certainly knew nothing. It still had to be worth a try.

And maybe Remus would finally get some answers.

There were a lot of frustrating things about being eleven again. Knowing the curriculum inside out. Being summarily dismissed whenever he tried to take an interest in anything outside of school and sports. Being short.

One thing Cedric had forgotten was how easily distracted children he were. He knew he was supposed to be listening to Professor McGonagall, but he honestly couldn't care less about Switching Spells. Not even the advanced versions that McGonagall had set him working on after he completed the set work in ten minutes in an effort to keep him busy.

Cedric hated fighting with his friends. He might have bickered with Salazar and the others constantly, but proper fights were rare. And now, after spending years living without Salazar only to find him again like this...

Cedric's forehead hit the desk with a thud. This wasn't easy for him, and he had grown up with a loving magical family. Salazar was Harry Potter, and Cedric was the only person he had. The only living person anyway.

Cedric had to talk to him. He had to make things right.

""Mister Diggory.""

Cedric jerked up in time to find McGonagall looming over his desk. Her lips were pinched, and the look she gave him was so reminiscent of Rowena that Cedric had to swallow down the lump in his throat.

""Yes, Professor?""

McGonagall's eyes narrowed. ""Is something the matter, Mister Diggory? I only ask because we are forty minutes into class, and your matchbox and quill remain quite unswitched.""

Cedric felt his cheeks heat up, and he ducked his head. ""Sorry, Professor, I've been distracted."" He waved his wand, remembering at the last moment to actually verbalise the incantation, and watched as the quill gained matchstick strands.

McGonagall's eyebrows shot up. ""Very impressive, Mister Diggory. Five points to Hufflepuff.""

Cedric spotted his housemates exchange grins out of the corner of his eye, but it failed to lift his spirits. ""Thank you, Professor.""

McGonagall held his gaze for a long moment, then nodded to herself. ""See me after class, Mister Diggory. And in the meantime, perhaps you wouldn't mind assisting Mister Summerby?""

Cedric blinked, his eggs and toast suddenly sitting very heavily in his stomach. The last thing he needed was for people to get suspicious in his very first term. Hopefully he hadn't done anything that would seem beyond the capabilities of a gifted eleven year old.

At least he finally had something to keep him distracted. He had really missed teaching. Summerby gave him a bright, relieved smile, and Cedric forced his own problems to one side. He had work to do.

By the time class finished, Cedric had secured Summerby's everlasting gratitude, and twenty more points for Hufflepuff. More than one person patted him on the back as they left the room, and as little as Cedric cared about the competition it was nice to see his friends in good spirits. It wasn't enough to make him forget his worries though, and his stomach was a ball of nerves as he stepped up to McGonagall's desk.

""You wanted to speak to me, Professor?""

""Yes, Mister Diggory."" She placed a stack of papers to one side, and peered at him over her glasses. ""I hope you understand that while Professor Sprout is your Head of House, you may come to any teacher, should you require assistance. Including myself.""

Cedric blinked. That had not been what he was expecting. Warmth flooded his chest, and he smiled. ""Thank you, Professor. I'm sorry I was a bit distracted before."" He hesitated, then realised he didn't actually need to lie. ""I got into a fight with a friend, but I'm going to fix it.""

McGonagall studied him for a long minute, and then to Cedric's surprise her stern face relaxed into a smile. ""That is a very mature attitude, Mister Diggory. See that you do.""

Cedric recognised the dismissal, and gave her a respectful nod before leaving the room. At least he knew that his House was in good hands.

Now all he had to do was talk to Harry.

Easier said than done, especially when he caught a flash of bright red hair in the corridor. Cedric swore under his breath, and ducked in between a pair of older students. He was going to be in for it the next time he saw the twins, but he couldn't find it in him to care. Right now, Salazar was more important. He ducked into a secret passage he was sure Fred and George didn't know about, and closed his eyes.

'Hogwarts?'

The familiar warmth enveloped his mind and soul, and despite his rising stress levels, Cedric had to smile. It was good to be home. 'Yes, Godric?'

'Where is he? The Chamber?'

'Of course. You'll no doubt be pleased to hear that Issa is asleep.'

Cedric shuddered. 'Thank you.'

There was no point in wasting time. Classes were done for the day, and he couldn't think of eating when things were so unsettled. He also knew better than to let Salazar spend too much time brooding.

Cedric sighed, and willed himself to the Chamber.

The place was...not how he remembered it. Salazar must have been apoplectic. Godric cleared the dingy water from the path with a wave of his wand, and squinted round.

""Salazar? Are you here?""

He was disappointed, but not particularly surprised when he didn't receive a reply. There was no sign of anyone in the main chamber, and he changed direction to head for the side passages.

""Salazar, I'm sorry,"" he tried again. ""Can you come out? We need to talk.""

There was a faint crash, and Cedric broke into a run. ""Salazar?""

He dashed around the corner fast enough that he skidded on the damp stone, and had to catch the wall to stay upright. ""Damn it!""

There was another crash, and then a head of messy black hair appeared round the nearest doorway. ""Cedric? What are you doing down here?""

""There you are!"" He straightened his robes with a frown. ""What do you think? I came to apologise.""

Harry bit his lip. ""Cedric-""

""Please, Harry, let me finish. I shouldn't have lost my temper.""

""Neither should I,"" Harry pointed out. He looked away, eyes falling to the floor. ""I was jealous and stupid, and I never should have gotten so upset about your other friends.""

""No,"" Cedric agreed. He crossed the room to grip Harry's shoulder. ""But I understand. I know...I know things haven't been easy for you. Even more so this time round. But I'm here now, and no matter what happens I'm staying. Nothing, and no one, can change that.""

Harry stared up at him, his green eyes impossibly large in his thin face, and Cedric pulled him in for a hug.

""You're my brother, Salazar. I've known you for decades."" He felt Harry twitch in his arms, and hugged him tighter. ""I know you,"" he whispered. ""I didn't go anywhere back then, and I'm not going anywhere now.""

Slowly, Harry's arms wrapped around Cedric's waist and he hugged back, tentatively at first but then so hard it was almost painful. ""I'm sorry,"" he whispered.

Cedric closed his eyes. They would be fine, just like they always were. He would get better at making time for Harry, and Harry would stop being quite so possessive. They only had to do this for two years, and then they could forget about the secrecy. They would be fine.

Harry let out a shaky breath and stepped back.

""I'm glad you came down here.""

Cedric ruffled his hair. ""Me too.""

""Not because of this,"" said Harry quickly. ""Well, not just because of it anyway.""

Unease started to coil in Cedric's stomach. ""What are you talking about?""

Harry looked around, his face as grim as Cedric had ever seen it. ""Someone has been down here. Recently.""

Cedric felt the blood drain from his face. Only someone of Salazar's blood could enter here, and considering what they had been able to trace of his family, and what was generally assumed of Slytherins in this time...

Harry caught his eye and nodded. ""We have to work out what they did.""

Dinner could wait. If Cedric's suspicions were correct, neither of them would be feeling much like eating.

The Chamber of Secrets used to be one of Salazar's favourite places in Hogwarts. The other Founders had contributed to its construction of course, but Salazar had designed it and placed the wards that would keep it secure, and it was his, just like the Room was Rowena's. The others were welcome, and always would be, but the Chamber was his.

After the past couple of weeks, Harry was beginning to wish that he never had to set foot in there again.

The place had been ransacked. All the cursed weapons and objects that he had Godric had spent so long hunting down were gone. Admittedly, some of them were more like trinkets that Rowena had asked them to keep away from their students, but too many could cause serious harm. There was a reason Salazar had made these wards so powerful.

Worse still, the books were gone.

A hand came to rest on his shoulder, and Harry was tired enough to lean into the touch.

""Have you been down here all night?""

Harry shrugged. ""If it's morning, then yes. Shouldn't you be in class?""

""Not yet, and we were worried about you,"" said Cedric gently. He settled down on the floor next to Harry and stretched his legs out. ""You can't keep brooding down here.""

""I know,"" Harry muttered. ""But I can't be out searching for whoever was stupid enough to take those books either. I can't do anything.""

Objectively he knew he was being ridiculous. There was no way of telling when the Chamber had been raided, or what had happened to everything that had been taken, but Harry couldn't help it. The rituals in those books were dangerous. They had been dangerous a thousand years ago, and with the advances that had been made since...

Cedric sighed. ""I know. It's maddening. But we just can't do anything yet."" He looped an arm round Harry's shoulders. ""And remember that this time its not just people like us dealing with such threats. There's an entire branch of the government dedicated to protecting people. We have to trust them until we're older.""

Harry scowled. Trust had never been one of his strong points, but Cedric was right. There simply wasn't anything they could do. Maybe when Helga and Rowena arrived...

""At least it'll be Christmas soon,"" said Cedric. ""We'll have to work out what we're going to do.""

Harry raised an eyebrow. Thanks to the Dursleys he cared for Christmas even less than he had in his first life. ""We're only two weeks into November,"" he pointed out. ""We've got more pressing matters to worry about.""

""Actually, we don't,"" said Cedric gently. ""We're children, remember? We've dealt with Binns, Bagshott has settled down and is an excellent teacher, our students are safe, and this is our first Christmas in centuries. We need a break.""

Harry just scowled at the floor. Cedric sighed, and disentangled himself from Harry and stood up. ""Look, I've got class, but this isn't over. Also, Helena wants to talk to you.""

That was enough to break Harry's attention from his bad mood. ""What? Why?""

""How about you ask her, and find out."" He reached down to pull Harry to his feet, but didn't let go straight away. ""I know how important this is to you,"" he said softly, ""but you can't spend the next two years dwelling on things you can't change.""

Harry let out a soft snort. ""Of course I could. Dwelling on things I can't change is one of my specialities.""

Cedric rolled his eyes. ""Why did I miss him?"" he asked, and Harry felt Hogwarts' amusement echo in his own mind. He aimed a half-hearted kick that his friend dodged easily. ""See? You've spent so long brooding that you're getting slow.""

""All right, all right,"" Harry grumbled. ""You've made your point. I'll stop coming down here as much.""

That didn't mean he would stop thinking about it, and judging from the gleam in Cedric's eyes the older boy knew it, but it was a start. Harry closed his eyes and willed himself back to the Room of Requirement. The piles of rubbish didn't do much to improve his mood.

The was a faint crack as Cedric appeared next to him. The older boy sighed.

""I've got to get to Herbology, but please try to stop obsessing. Go and find Helena, that'll cheer you up.""

Harry wasn't sure seeing the ghost of his surrogate niece would do much to cheer up him up, but he managed to refrain from saying so. Cedric squeezed his shoulder. ""I'll see you this evening, all right?""

""Thanks,"" Harry mumbled.

Cedric clapped him on the back and headed off, though not without a worried backward look. Harry sighed. He had caused Godric enough stress in his first life. He forced his own frustrations to the side and headed out after his friend. Time to see what Helena needed.

Alastor Moody wasn't one to dwell on the past. He was an Auror, and knew damn well that regrets were a waste of time. Far better to focus on the task at hand.

That didn't stop him occasionally cursing the Death Eaters that had cost him his leg. He kicked aside the chair that had threatened to entangle his prosthesis, and rapped on the office doorframe.

""Got a minute?""

Scrimgeour snorted. ""But, Alastor, don't you know how much I love reviewing Ministerial audits?"" He shoved the papers aside with a contemptuous flick of his hand, and waved Alastor to a chair. ""Paper-pushing imbeciles.""

Alastor smirked as he eased his aching body into the proffered seat. ""Told you taking that job was a mistake.""

""So you did,"" Scrimgeour grumbled. ""And every other day since."" He looked at the papers like he wanted to incinerate them, before reluctantly shaking his head and glancing back at Alastor. ""Anyway. What do you need?""

Alastor hesitated. He had served alongside Scrimgeour for years, and considered the younger wizard a friend as well as a comrade, but this was tricky. Scrimgeour, like Amelia Bones, had made his views on independent action very clear during the War. There was a good chance of this sparking old arguments.

But then, Scrimgeour had also understood what had to be done, and despite refusing to align with Dumbledore and the Order, he had turned a blind eye to others doing so. He had even passed along key information at times, though always with the proviso that no one else should know how a humble Auror came by such details.

When it came down to it, Alastor trusted Scrimgeour, and that wasn't something to be taken lightly.

""I've just had an interesting conversation,"" he began, ""with Remus Lupin.""

Scrimgeour cocked his head to one side, but he said nothing and Alastor continued, ""He is requesting a visit with Sirius Black.""

Scrimgeour's amber eyes narrowed. ""I see.""

Alastor grunted. It had been nearly seven years since Black's incarceration, and in all that time the Death Eater had never had a single visitor. Alastor himself had never even considered the idea, partly, he had to admit, out of wounded pride. He had badly misjudged Black, and the Potters had paid the price. He should have known better.

""Did Lupin give a reason?""

Alastor pulled himself back to the present, and shook his head. ""Just that he wanted an explanation.""

""Wouldn't we all?"" Scrimgeour muttered. He ran a hand through his hair and scowled at Alastor. ""You knew them. What do you think?""

Alastor scratched at his mutilated nose. ""He was telling the truth."" All the young ones had quickly learned better than to try lying to him, and Lupin had always had the most common sense of his friends. ""But he was hiding something. He was worried.""

He didn't say anything else. He didn't need to. Scrimgeour met his eyes, and nodded. ""The visit is approved. You will supervise.""

Alastor nodded, but a glance from Scrimgeour kept him in his seat. The Head Auror's face was as grim as Alastor had ever seen it. ""Black was You-Know-Who's right hand man,"" he said quietly. ""If there is anyone who might have knowledge of any other plans, it's Black.""

Alastor just nodded again. They had fought one war. They would do whatever it took to avoid a second.

Tracking down a ghost wasn't as difficult as it sounded. At least not if one was intimately connected to Hogwarts' wards, and had the full cooperation of the castle itself. It also helped when one had known the ghost in question since she was born, and knew every one of her favourite hiding spots.

Harry weaved in and out of the crowds of students, easily going unnoticed in the chaos. The crowds made his skin itch, but he couldn't deny that the anonymity was a welcome change. It probably wouldn't last long once he officially arrived and everyone knew who he was, and Harry fully intended to make the most of it until then.

It didn't take long to leave the students behind. Harry ducked down secret passages and climbed hidden staircases that had long lain undisturbed, judging from the thick layers of dust, until he finally emerged onto a small balcony overlooking the northernmost staircase.

The torches were lit as always, but Helena's shimmering form still drew Harry's eye. Her face was still set in the mask of grim sadness that Harry had become so familiar with over the past few months, and the sight made his chest ache. What had happened to the laughing child who had clung to his ankles and helped him throw snowballs at Godric? He shook the thought away and stepped forward.

""Helena?""

Ghosts couldn't exactly jump, but Helena did turn to him. ""Uncle.""

""You wanted to see me?"" said Harry slowly. There was something wrong here. Helena was avoiding his gaze in the exact same way she used to when she had been hiding something from him as a child. ""What's wrong?""

The faintest trace of a smile touched Helena's face. ""I never could get anything past you."" She sighed, and looked him straight in the eye. ""The last boy who opened your Chamber.""

Harry froze. ""What of him?""

""I...I spoke to him once. About who I am. And about Edmund.""

Harry stared at her. Over the last couple of months he had watched Helena interact with the students. Though always polite and helpful, at least to the Ravenclaws, she kept everyone at a distance. Even with Professor Flitwick, she remained cordial at best.

He couldn't imagine her telling anyone about her death.

And if the one person he had told had also had the ability to enter the Chamber of Secrets...

""He was interested in you,"" Helena said softly. ""All four of you. What descendants you had, what magic you created, the items you made, he wanted to know everything."" She looked away. ""He was very charming, and it...it had been a long time.""

Harry closed his eyes. ""I understand."" If he had been on his own for a thousand years, he might want to talk to someone now and then too. He forced the thought away and looked back at her. ""What else can you tell me about him?""

Helena frowned. ""Very little. He was a Slytherin. He was particularly interested in you. He applied for the post of Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher after leaving, but Headmaster Dumbledore refused.""

""Why?"" Harry asked.

""I do not know,"" said Helena. ""I don't think he trusted him."" She hesitated. ""There is something else, Salazar. It...you will not like to hear this.""

""What else is new?"" Harry muttered. ""Tell me.""

Helena bit her lip. ""He didn't just open the Chamber.""

Harry stared at her, and then everything fell into place with horrifying clarity. ""He believed what they say about me. He believed what they say the Chamber was built for.""

Nausea swirled in his gut, and he sat down before his knees gave out. The pounding of blood in his ears was deafening, and every breath burned in his lungs. What had Selene's descendent done? How had everything gone so wrong?

Then he barely choked back a cry as something icy cold touched the back of his neck. He jerked away, and only then became aware of Helena's voice, shrill with barely-contained panic.

""-for me, Salazar, you have to breathe. You need to calm down.""

He was scaring her. Harry sucked in a desperate gasp of air, and was rewarded with a relieved prayer. ""That's it, Salazar. Everything is all right.""

""No,"" Harry whispered. ""No, it isn't.""

His Chamber had been opened and used for the opposite of its intended purpose. Harry had read enough to know what scholars had assumed Issa was for. The lump in his throat threatened to choke off his speech, but he had to know. ""Was...was anyone hurt?""

Helena's silence was all the answer he needed. Harry buried his face in his arms. ""He hurt my students.""

Worse still, he had used Issa to hurt students. Harry tasted bile in the back of his throat, and concentrated on the pain of his nails digging into his palms to keep from throwing up. Everything good thing he had tried to do for the school had gone wrong.

""This wasn't your fault, Salazar,"" Helena whispered.

""I was the one who hid a Basilisk in my school,"" Harry growled. ""I should have known better. Rowena and Godric were right.""

""You couldn't have known that your family would become so twisted,"" said Helena firmly. Harry glared at her, but Helena didn't give him a chance to interrupt, ""And it was not always this way. Many of Selene's line found the Chamber, and not one of them betrayed your trust. If not for Issa, this school would have fallen in the thirteenth century.""

Harry finally looked up at that. Helena gave him a small smile. ""All you wanted was to protect the school, and you did.""

Harry took a deep breath, then another. ""Issa is my responsibility,"" he said quietly. ""When did this happen?""

There was definite wariness in Helena's eyes as she looked at him. ""About fifty years ago.""

Harry's jaw tightened. Fifty years was nothing to wizards. If he was still alive, then Harry would find him. ""What was his name?""

Helena's whisper sounded like a thunderstorm in the silence, ""Tom Riddle.""

Cedric was worried.

This was in no way an unusual occurrence when Salazar was concerned. Godric had spent most of his life worrying about his friend. He had known from the start that things would be no different with Harry.

Things would be much easier when Rowena and Helga were back.

For now though it was just Cedric, and if there was one thing he was good at it was managing Salazar's moods. Admittedly, he had never had to deal with a Salazar that had found out that one of his distant relatives had released a Basilisk into the castle and killed a student and whose reputation was in ruins, but Cedric was never one to back down from a challenge.

This time he didn't need to ask where Harry was. He started for the seventh floor, performing the usual detour into one of the more obscure secret passages in order to avoid the Weasley twins. The pair were really starting to get on his nerves.

He arrived at the Room of Requirement a few minutes later, only slightly out of breath, and slipped inside before anyone could interrupt. He was met by the now familiar sight of towering piles of rubbish.

""Harry? Where are you?""

There was no reply. Cedric sighed, and started to pick his way through the stacks. ""Come on, Harry. We need to talk.""

There was a faint crash, and Cedric changed direction slightly. He squeezed in between a broken cabinet and a gargoyle, to find Harry digging through a trunk. The younger boy spared him only a brief scowl.

""Don't you have class?""

""Maybe I need to give you a copy of my timetable,"" Cedric muttered under his breath. ""They finished an hour ago, and I've eaten. Unlike you.""

It was a guess, but a very reasonable one based on experience. The snort he received confirmed it. ""I can eat later.""

Cedric rubbed his eyes. ""Really? Because you said that yesterday, and Teaky told me you didn't touch anything.""

Harry muttered something under his breath. Cedric sighed, and knelt next to him. ""Harry, you do realise that you haven't left this room in nearly a week, don't you?""

Harry blinked, then dismissed the information with a scowl. ""This is more important. Helena said Riddle brought back Rowena's Diadem, and she is convinced that he hid it here. I have to find it. I have to find out what he was up to.""

Cedric sighed, and reached out to grip Harry's shoulders. The younger boy resisted, but Cedric forced him to look round. ""Yes, we do,"" he said grimly. ""But you don't have to do it right now."" Harry's collarbones were worryingly sharp under his hands, and Cedric had to fight the urge to shake some sense into him. ""Whatever Riddle did, it was over fifty years ago, and it hasn't caused any damage. You don't have to kill yourself trying to find it right away.""

""You don't know that,"" Harry snapped. He rubbed angrily at his scar. ""I'm sure that he is linked to the Dark magic here, and Dark magic is harmful by its very definition. I have to find it.""

Cedric sighed. ""We will,"" he repeated. ""But right now, you're getting some fresh air.""

That did the trick. Harry's gaze finally shifted from the surrounding rubbish, and he looked at Godric in outright horror. ""Outside?"" he repeated. ""It's November! There's already snow! And you're already past your curfew.""

""Yes, Salazar, I really care about curfew,"" said Cedric dryly. ""And don't start about snow, your leg doesn't hurt any more. Besides,"" he said, when Harry tried to open his mouth, ""I've got something special planned.""

Harry eyed him. ""When you say special-""

""No, it has nothing to do with dragons,"" Cedric snapped. ""You're not Helga.""

""Are you sure? Because I remember the last special adventure you took me on very vividly, and I do not need another practical lesson on our school motto.""

Cedric couldn't help a snort of laughter, and felt a warm glow when the corner of Harry's mouth twitched. ""It has nothing to do with dragons, or any other dangerous beasts,"" he promised. ""It'll be fun, I swear.""

Harry still looked sceptical, but Cedric was used to that. He knew exactly what he was doing.

""He dodged us again.""

""I know,"" Fred snapped. ""I was there."" George rolled his eyes, and Fred sighed. ""Sorry. I just don't get what's going on with him.""

George grunted an acknowledgement. Fred slumped back into the armchair, letting his gaze drift around the Common Room. ""This would have been so much easier if he had ended up in Gryffindor too.""

Honestly, he had been convinced that their friend would be joining them. Cedric had always been up for adventures for as long as they had known him, and he never backed down from a challenge.

George, though, was shaking his head. ""I don't know. I thought he was going to be a Ravenclaw, what with all the time he spent talking about school with Bill and Percy.""

""Nah, he's too much fun for a Ravenclaw,"" said Fred.

""They're not actually that bad,"" George pointed out. ""Have you seen that third year who can make a light show when she plays violin?""

""Okay yeah, that is cool,"" Fred admitted, ""but Cedric still should be with us!""

Someone cleared their throat behind them. ""If I might interrupt for a moment?""

""Why ask when you're going to do it anyway?"" Fred muttered. George elbowed him, and he pulled a face. ""What do you want, Percy?""

Percy cleared his throat again and pushed his glasses further up his nose. ""I just wanted to point out that Cedric being in a different house doesn't mean he's not your friend any more. I have plenty of friends in other houses.""

Fred opened his mouth, then closed it again when George kicked him. Percy eyed them both until George sighed. ""We know, and we've been trying, but it's hard. Especially when he's avoiding us.""

Percy sniffed. ""I highly doubt he's ignoring you. Just because he's in a different house-""

""But that's not the problem!"" Fred exploded. He pushed himself to his feet and started pacing in front of the fire. ""He never waits for us after class, he always tries to dodge us in the corridors, half of the time we don't even see him at meals! There's something wrong, and we're going to find out what.""

Because at the end of the day Cedric was their friend, and Fred knew there was something wrong and so nothing was going to stop him from helping. George's eyes met his in perfect understanding and agreement, and Fred felt his frustration cool to a steady glow. Cedric was smart and good at keeping secrets, but they were Weasleys. Nothing could stop them from helping a friend.

Although Percy might be a problem. Fred glared at his older brother, but before he could say anything Percy nodded.

""That doesn't sound like him at all. Is there anything I can do?""

Fred felt a rare surge of affection for the stuffiest member of the family, but then found himself hesitating. The only real clue they had about Cedric's behaviour was the boy they had seen him with that one time, and that wasn't much to go on. They hadn't even been able to get a good look at him. George caught his eye and coughed.

""Not really. We're just going to keep an eye on him and see if we can figure it out.""

Percy sighed. ""Or you could just talk to him?""

Twin snorts met his words. Percy rolled his eyes. ""He's your friend. Why can't you talk to him?""

""Have you tried getting anything out of Cedric when he doesn't want to tell you?"" Fred demanded. ""He's impossible!""

George nodded. ""It's been three years and we still don't know how he speaks Mandarin.""

""Exactly."" Fred dropped back into the armchair and folded his arms. ""He's not going to tell us anything. We've got to be more sneaky.""

""Merlin help us,"" Percy muttered.

Fred glanced at George, and saw his own mischief mirrored in his twin's eyes. As one they turned to Percy.

""Hey, Perce, you still interested in helping us out?""

The alarm that lit Percy's eyes was almost enough to make Fred forget his frustration. They would find out what Cedric was hiding eventually. It would probably end up being a disappointment, but they would have fun trying. If they could get Percy to loosen up too, that was just a nice bonus.

""It really shouldn't be this easy to sneak out of the school.""

Harry didn't need to look to know that Cedric was rolling his eyes. ""The students don't have our advantages. And they definitely don't know about some of these passages.""

""Not even the Weasleys?"" Harry asked.

This time Cedric did glance back long enough to scowl at him. ""Stop it. They've only been here a couple of months."" He paused. ""And even they won't find this one. Now hurry up.""

Harry grinned, but stepped up his pace. He had no intention of admitting it, but he had needed to get out of the Room of Requirement. He needed to keep working, to find out what Riddle had done to their school, but Cedric was right. Burning out wouldn't do anyone any good. He knew that from experience.

Harry had always loved Hogwarts at night. Without the crowds of students he was free to soak in the ambient magic of the castle, and all without having to worry about hiding from the rest of its inhabitants. He followed Cedric through the familiar passages, neither of them bothering with a light. Cedric had refused to tell him what they were doing, but just the idea of getting some fresh air was looking more and more appealing. Maybe he had spent too much time inside over the last couple of weeks.

""Hopefully the caretaker doesn't know about this one,"" Cedric murmured. ""Charlie said he can be a pain to dodge.""

""I think we'll manage,"" said Harry dryly.

Even without Hogwarts keeping an eye out for them, no one knew the castle better than they did. Cedric grinned back at him, then held up a hand as they reached the exit. For a minute they both froze, then Cedric relaxed.

""All right, everything's good. Come with me.""

Harry followed close on his heels, tugging his cloak more tightly around himself. They had been lucky enough to avoid any heavy snowfalls so far, but the November night was still bitterly cold. He pushed himself into a jog, enjoying the lack of pain shooting through his leg.

""Are you going to tell me where we're going yet?""

Cedric shook his head. ""Still not a fan of surprises, I see."" He tapped Harry's shoulder to direct him through the grounds towards a set of small huts. ""Down there.""

Harry frowned. He'd seen the buildings from a distance when he went running in the mornings, but he hadn't gotten round to investigating further. He let Cedric pass him, and followed his friend down until they came to a stop. The door was sealed with a simple locking charm that Cedric disposed of with embarrassingly little effort before turning to grin at Harry.

""You'll enjoy this.""

Harry quirked an eyebrow, but one look inside left him gaping. ""You have got to be joking.""

Cedric burst out laughing. ""I'm serious, Harry.""

""I am not going flying! You do remember how awful they are, don't you?""

He tried to back away, but Cedric threw an arm around his shoulders. ""Of course I do. It was like sitting on a stick."" He grinned. ""However, everyone else agreed and someone invented a wonderful spell known as the Cushioning Charm.""

Harry hesitated. Cedric didn't waste the chance, ""And there have been so many other developments. You know how even the best made brooms could barely go faster than a horse? Well, the latest Cleansweep can do nought to sixty in ten seconds! And you have got to see a professional Quidditch match, you have no idea what sort of things they can do nowadays-""

""All right,"" Harry interrupted. ""I'll give it a try.""

Cedric's smile was dazzling in the moonlight. ""Thank you, Harry. I promise you won't regret it.""

Harry scowled, but it was half-hearted at best. He was never able to say no to Godric when he got so excited about something. Not that much had changed. He sighed, and followed Cedric into the hut. ""Let's get on with this.""

He reached for the nearest broom, only for Cedric to grab his wrist. ""Not that one! Look at the tail twigs, it'll be constantly drifting to the left! And not that one either,"" he added, when Harry changed direction. ""See how the wood is warped? That will make it more unpredictable and harder to control.""

Harry folded his arms. ""I thought you said these things were good.""

""They are,"" said Cedric. ""But these are ancient because the governors won't pay for new ones. Bill and Charlie have been complaining about them for years."" His expression turned thoughtful. ""You know, these brooms really aren't safe for our students-""

""You are not setting them on fire,"" Harry interrupted. ""Just show me which one is the best for a beginner.""

Cedric pouted, an expression that did not work nearly as well as Helga's did, but walked up and down the racks studying the brooms and muttering under his breath. Harry waited as patiently as he could, until finally Cedric sighed and selected one of the brooms.

""Try this one. It's missing a lot of twigs so it won't accelerate properly, but that's probably for the best as it's your first time.""

""Thanks,"" said Harry dryly.

At least the thing looked better than they used to. He could feel the spells holding it together, as well as many more that he couldn't identify but which felt like speed and flight. The magic soothed the knot of anxiety in the pit of his stomach, and Cedric clapped him on the shoulder. ""Ready?""

Harry took a deep breath, and followed him back out into the open. Cedric led them a little way across the lawn before he stopped and turned back to Harry. ""This will be all right for now,"" he said. ""Maybe if we do this again we'll try out the Quidditch stadium.""

Harry bit back what he really wanted to say, but something must have shown on his face because Cedric rolled his eyes. ""Anyway, this is how you mount a broom.""

Godric had always been a good teacher, and a few minutes later found Harry seated far more comfortably than he had expected and ready to go. Cedric had mounted his own broom and manoeuvred it round so that was facing Harry.

""All right, so now we're going to kick off gently.""

Harry nodded stiffly. His hands were beginning to shake from the cold, and he gripped the broom tighter. Cedric caught his eye. ""I'll be right here,"" he promised. ""The second I think something's going wrong I can take control of your broom and guide it back down.""

Harry's trembling eased. He let out a long breath, and kicked off.

Flying was nothing like he remembered. Flying a thousand years ago had been painful and uncomfortable and terrifying.

Flying now was wonderful.

Harry had intended to go slowly. He knew his limits, and he wasn't going to do anything that Cedric hadn't shown him how to do, but flying wasn't difficult, flying was easy and instinctive and Harry couldn't help himself. For the first time in a long time all his worries fell away and he lost himself in the sheer thrill of flight.

""Harry!""

He had also completely forgotten about Cedric. Harry spun the broom round to hover in midair, and a moment later Cedric came to a halt in front of him. The older boy's eyes were very wide.

""Where did you learn how do to that?""

Harry laughed. ""I don't know,"" he said breathlessly, ""but this is incredible. Race you to the lake!""

He didn't give Cedric a chance to argue, but he heard laughter echo through the night sky and gave in to his own grin. The was the best thing he had done in months.

They spent longer than they should have testing out the brooms. Cedric showed Harry some of the tips and tricks he had learned from Charlie Weasley, and Harry let himself forget the stresses of the last few weeks. This was something new and something he could do well and Harry revelled in it.

Eventually though Cedric turned his broom towards the ground. Harry followed, taking the last opportunity to get as much speed out of the broom as possible, and landed lightly on the grass. Cedric quirked an eyebrow at him, and Harry was too flushed with exhilaration to care.

""Yes, you were right. That was fun.""

Cedric threw an arm round his shoulders. ""I'm glad you liked it. Though if Ro and Helga ask, you didn't do any of those stunts on your very first flight, okay?""

Harry ducked his head. He hadn't been able to resist. Cedric gave him a light shake. ""We can do this again tomorrow night. I'll see if I can sneak out some Quidditch balls too. There's no way you won't make the house team if you can fly like that now.""

""Thank you,"" said Harry quietly.

Cedric had always known what he needed. Cedric's arm tightened around his shoulders. ""You're allowed to be a kid for a few years, Sal.""

Harry wanted to argue, but with his heart still racing and the thrill of flight was still humming through his mind and he just couldn't find the words. Cedric just smiled, and pulled him into a quick hug, and under the starlit sky in the presence of his best friend, Harry finally let himself relax.

""You know,"" said Cedric, ""new brooms really are a lot better. As well as safer.""

Harry stared at him, but the combination of more speed, more comfort, and more manoeuvrability, was incredibly tempting. And it would be harder for Muggle-borns to learn on these ancient brooms. Flying was tricky enough without having to control a misbehaving broom, and the last thing first years needed was to get hurt during a lesson...

Cedric's grin was bigger than ever, and Harry rolled his eyes. ""Fine. But at least try to keep it inconspicuous.""

""Of course,"" said Cedric gravely. His eyes were gleaming. ""I found the best book of fire spells in the library, and I've been waiting to try them out.""

Harry couldn't help it. He burst out laughing.

Alastor knocked brusquely on the door to Scrimgeour's office and pushed it open without waiting for a response. Scrimgeour raised an eyebrow, but had known him long enough to just wave him to a seat. Alastor did so, but not before kicking the door shut. They were the only ones still working, but there was no point in taking chances. He added the usual secrecy spells, and waited for Scrimgeour to add his own before he started to speak.

""I can't find the transcripts from Sirius Black's trial.""

Scrimgeour's amber eyes narrowed, and he leaned back in his chair. ""There's no shortage of people who could have accessed them.""

That had been Alastor's first thought too. ""Tried all the usual places. And the unusual ones. There's nothing except the records of his apprehension and transfer to Azkaban.""

Scrimgeour stilled completely. ""Can you think of any reason why someone would tamper with the trial records, and yet leave those?""

""No,"" Alastor growled. ""Which leaves one possibility.""

Scrimgeour's hand clenched on his cane. Alastor didn't even try to hide his own contempt. Neither of them had been on active duty at the time of Voldemort's defeat; Alastor due to having his leg blown off, while Scrimgeour had still been recovering from a particularly vicious curse to his knee that had refused to stop bleeding until what seemed like half of St Mungo's and Albus Dumbledore himself had joined forces on the problem. That didn't mean they were unaware of the chaos that had followed Voldemort's defeat.

Too few Aurors and too many convicts were no excuse for not giving proper trials.

Alastor could see the anger building in his boss' eyes, but Scrimgeour's voice remained quiet.

""The visit has been authorised for three days from now. Take note of whatever Black says. Find out what happened.""

Alastor raised an eyebrow. ""Shouldn't there be more than one Auror in attendance for that?""

""There should have been a trial,"" Scrimgeour snarled. He took a moment to collect himself, the frustration vanishing under his usual languid calm, before continuing, ""I'll talk to Amelia, but going through the proper channels will take too long. We might as well get a head start.""

Alastor nodded. He had no problem with that. No matter what Black had done, everyone deserved a fair trial. They would get to the truth, one way or another.

Remus Lupin had been terrified of Azkaban for as long as he could remember. As a child his grandmother had told him stories that had given him nightmares for months. After he became a werewolf, after he became dangerous, the fear had only increased. Even now, as a fully trained wizard capable of producing a perfectly adequate Patronus, just thinking about Dementors was enough to make him break out in a sweat.

Sirius had been in Azkaban for eight years.

He deserved it. He had betrayed Lily and James to Voldemort, he had got them killed, he had murdered Peter. If anyone deserved imprisonment in that hell it was Sirius Black.

Or so Remus had spent eight years trying to tell himself.

The boat lurched, and Remus grabbed hold of the side before he took an unwelcome dip in the North Sea. The spells propelling the boat were perfectly adequate, but not exactly designed with passenger comfort in mind.

""Careful, Lupin,"" came a gravelly voice. ""The boat won't stop for you.""

Remus glanced round. Alastor's magical eye was spinning in every direction, but there was a definite glint in his real one. Remus snorted. ""You tried that one on us during the war, Alastor, and we didn't believe it then.""

""Pettigrew did,"" Alastor shot back. ""So did Potter, for that matter.""

Despite the awful circumstances, Remus had to smile at the memory. For one of the most brilliant people Remus had ever known, James had had his moments of being remarkably trusting. Remus and Peter had taken full advantage of his lack of knowledge about the Muggle world, and the older members of the Order had seized on the rare moments of levity.

The smile died though as Alastor nodded past him.

""There we are, lad. Hell on earth.""

Remus swallowed. It had been a bright winter morning when they left. Now the sky was thick was grey clouds, and the high walls of Azkaban seemed to suck out what little light remained. A shiver wracked his body. They were too far for the Dementors to be affecting him, but just the thought...

""Lupin. Focus.""

""Yes, sir,"" said Remus automatically, before remembering that he wasn't in the Order any more and flushing. Alastor just rolled his eyes.

""Mind the bump as we dock. And let me do that talking.""

""That's fine by me,"" said Remus. He had no intention of going anywhere near the guards. He braced himself against the side of the boat as they drew alongside the pier, and watched as the ropes uncoiled themselves and secured the vessel.

Alastor hopped ashore with far more agility than would be expected of a man with a wooden leg. Remus followed more reluctantly. Thick fog was rolling down from the tower, and he shivered. Already he could feel the presence of the Dementors bearing down on him, bringing all the thoughts of his losses and failures bubbling to the surface of his mind...

""Focus, Lupin,"" Alastor snapped. ""Or stay in the boat.""

Lupin shook his head. ""Yes, sorry. I'll be fine.""

He would have been insulted by the scepticism in Alastor's eye if he wasn't feeling so awful. Alastor jabbed his wand, and a brilliant silver badger burst into life at his feet. Immediately the growing feelings of despair faded, and Remus took a shaky breath. He fumbled for his own wand, a moment later his wolf joined Alastor's badger. Alastor quirked an eyebrow, and Remus flushed.

""I can make it noncoporeal,"" he muttered.

Alastor's other eyebrow shot up. ""Impressive control, but stick to that one for now. Come on."" He started down the path to the prison, then paused, and glanced back. ""Concentrate on your Patronus, or whatever memory is sustaining it. Keep that at full power. Don't look at the Dementors, don't look at the prisoners, and don't wander off.""

Remus swallowed. ""Don't worry about that.""

He stuck a bit closer to Alastor than was strictly necessary as they made their way along the path, but the Auror didn't say anything. Two Dementors were stationed at the entrance, but Alastor's stride didn't falter as he stomped forward.

""Alastor Moody, Auror, with Remus Lupin. We are here on the authorisation of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.""

For a moment neither Dementor moved, but Alastor held firm and they finally moved aside. Remus took a deep breath, pushed more power into his wolf, and followed Alastor into Azkaban. The cold increased as he passed the Dementors, but the wolf pressed close against his side and Remus forced himself to keep looking straight ahead. He wasn't a criminal. He was allowed to be here. He had nothing to be afraid of.

""He's in cell 39,"" Alastor muttered. ""Let's get this over with.""

Several corridors and three flights of stairs later, Remus was all but ready to flee back to the boat. The stench of the Dementors was making his nose burn, and even with the two Patronuses it was a struggle to keep his worst memories from overwhelming him.

It was small consolation that Alastor was also looking pale by the time they reached the right floor.

""Not going to miss this part of the job,"" he grunted. The badger nosed at his knee, and he straightened. ""That way.""

""You're retiring?"" Remus asked. He'd thought the older man would die at his post.

""Focus, Lupin.""

Remus suppressed a sigh, and followed. Maybe he was too easily distracted. Now that he was there though, there was no hiding from the fact that was about to come face to face with his only surviving friend. One of the people who had made his school years bearable, and had gone on to murder three of their friends.

For once, Alastor didn't prompt him into action. In fact his dark eye was surprisingly gentle. Remus took a deep breath, and stepped in front of the bars.

He had to squint to see anything. The only light came from a flickering torch by the stairs, and Sirius' cell was one of the furthest along. All he could make out was a misshapen lump hidden in the shadows, and after a moment's hesitation Remus waved his wolf closer to the bars.

""Sirius?""

In the silver light of the Patronus the lump coalesced into a mound of tattered blankets. Remus' stomach lurched as he took in the grimy cell, with the stained stone floor and the streaks of mould on the walls. Sirius had spent the last eight years here, in a cell that was barely five paces long.

""Sirius?""

There was still no answer. Alastor rolled his eyes and stomped forward. ""Black,"" he barked. ""On your feet. We're here to talk to you.""

For a minute there was no reply, then the blankets shifted. A head of matted black hair, so different from the shining waves Remus remembered, appeared, and then Remus found himself frozen in place at the sight of his best friend.

Sirius looked...insane. His skin was waxy, and so stretched over his bones that he could have been a corpse. The wild hair, beard, and moustache only added to the impression, but worse still were the eyes. In Remus' memories they sparkled with fire and mischief. Now they burned with an obsession bordering on the deranged. It took a moment for them to focus on Remus, then the cracked lips drew up in a slash of a smile.

""Hello, Moony,"" he rasped. ""It's been a while.""

""Hello, Sirius,"" said Remus quietly.

He was amazed by how steady his voice was. He had known that Azkaban was a terrible place, but this...

""Black,"" Alastor snapped. ""We're here to talk to you.""

Sirius' eyes finally left Remus'. ""Moody. Nice eye. Eyepatch might have been less traumatic for the kids, y'know. You'd have made an awesome pirate too.""

Despite himself, the corner of Remus' mouth twitched before he quickly suppressed it. It had been a long time. Alastor just grunted.

""Enough chatter. We're here to talk about you.""

The awful smile widened. ""You know everything about me. Sirius Black, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, the man who couldn't protect his brother, and who got his best friends killed, and who couldn't avenge them-""

""Black!"" Alastor snapped, cutting off the increasingly hysterical ranting, but Remus' mind had already locked on his words.

""Avenge them? How could you avenge them, you betrayed them!""

Sirius moved faster than Remus had thought possible. He lunged forward to seize the cell bars. ""I never betrayed them! I would have died before betraying them! I failed and I got them killed but I never betrayed them!""

""You're not making any sense!"" Remus snarled. ""You were the Secret-Keeper! You were the only one who could have told Voldemort-""

""I wasn't the Secret-Keeper!""

Remus jerked back. ""W-what?""

Next to him, Alastor had gone very still. Sirius' eyes didn't leave Remus'. ""James asked me,"" he said, and his voice had fallen to a scratchy whisper. ""He trusted me. But I had to be clever, I thought it would be safer if they used someone they'd never suspect...""

Everything fell into place, and the wolf Patronus vanished at the same moment Remus' knees buckled. ""Peter. They...they used Peter.""

""Hold on,"" Alastor interrupted. ""How do we know you're telling the truth?""

Sirius let out a hollow laugh, so different from the joyful sound of their Hogwarts years. ""Look around. Being innocent is the only thing that's kept me sane. It's the only thing the Dementors can't take from me.""

Alastor's scowl deepened, but he said nothing. Remus stared from him to Black. ""Could that be true?""

Sirius did seem different from the other inmates. They were either talking nonsense, or barely conscious lumps. Sirius though... The obsession was there, but Sirius had always been intense, and after eight years with just one thing to focus on...

""Of course it's true!"" Sirius screamed. ""I would have died before betraying James! I would have died for any of you! But no one asked! They locked me up and let Peter get away with murdering all those people and no one ever cared about the truth because of course Sirius Black was evil and deranged like all the rest of his psycho family-""

""Wait,"" Remus interrupted. ""What do you mean no one asked?""

Next to him Alastor tensed, but Remus couldn't tear his eyes from Sirius'. Sirius, who had gone very still. ""No,"" he said, and this time his voice was very soft. ""No one asked.""

""But at the trial-""

""What trial?"" Sirius laughed again. ""That bastard Crouch found a Black and some dead bodies, that was all he needed.""

Remus had to lean against the wall to keep from collapsing. ""You...you didn't have a trial.""

How was that even possible? Yes, things had been chaotic after Voldemort's fall, but they weren't savages. Everyone was entitled to a trial. Bellatrix Lestrange and her accomplices had had a trial.

Then he realised that Alastor had yet to say a word, and whirled on the Auror.

""You knew.""

""Not until two days ago,"" sad Alastor quietly. Neither of his eyes were meeting Remus'. ""Things would be different if I had.""

""You were the most successful Auror in the country,"" Remus snarled. ""How could you not know?""

""Because I was either in St. Mungo's or on the streets,"" Alastor snapped. ""Along with all the others who actually did our jobs in that time."" He scrubbed a hand over his worn features, and when he looked back his eyes were flashing. ""We spent months tracking those bastards down, and we did our jobs right, damn it. Everything we had we handed over, then we went back and started after the next maniac. Everyone was supposed to get a trial!""

Remus glared at him, but there was no lie in Alastor's face. He remembered the chaos of those days and weeks; no one had known what had happened or what was going to happen next. It had taken months for everything to return to normal.

Maybe it wasn't so surprising that trials had been neglected, especially for such a seemingly clear-cut case as Sirius'.

Sirius gripped the bars, his burning gaze locking into Remus.

""I never betrayed them,"" he croaked. ""I would have died first.""

Sirius had never been able to lie to his friends. Remus looked at him, at the desperation in his face, and finally believed him.

But even as relief left his knees shaking, the revelation sent a spike of ice through his stomach. If Sirius had never been a Death Eater, if he had no knowledge of any plans they might have had in the event if Voldemort's defeat...

""Oh no.""

Sirius drew back, expression closing off, and Remus was quick to clarify. ""Not you! If you're innocent..."" He couldn't let himself think about that, and forged on, ""But you don't know anything about what the Death Eaters were doing? Or planning?""

""Of course not,"" Sirius insisted. ""How could I? And no one talks in here, they're all crazy."" His eyes bored into Remus'. ""Why? What's going on?""

Remus bit his lip hard enough to draw blood. He had no idea what telling Sirius about Harry might do, and then there was Alastor. Albus had clearly been trying to keep Harry's disappearance quiet, and it wasn't the kind of thing Alastor could or would keep from his superiors. Telling them would be a terrible mistake.

Harry was missing, and Remus didn't care.

""I hoped you might,"" he said quietly, ""because Harry is missing.""

""What?"" Alastor demanded.

""Missing?"" hissed Sirius at the same moment. His knuckles turned white on the bars. ""When? How? He was supposed to be safe, Hagrid promised me that he was going to his family-""

""He did,"" said Remus quickly. He ran a hand through his hair. ""He disappeared at the start of the summer.""

Alastor's magical eye was spinning fast enough to make Remus feel slightly queasy. ""And were only finding out now?"" he snarled. ""It's our job to find missing persons, especially if they're children. Does Albus know?"" He interrupted himself with a harsh laugh. ""Of course he does. Albus has to keep his secrets."" He turned away for a moment, and when he looked back both eyes fixed on Remus. ""You know I have to tell Scrimgeour about this.""

""I don't care,"" said Remus. ""I just want Harry found before anything happens.""

Alastor nodded shortly. ""We'll need to know everything you do. We'll keep it strictly need to know, the last thing we need is this getting out, but if Albus hasn't found him yet...""

He didn't need to finish the sentence. Remus nodded. He trusted the Headmaster with his life, but this visit had only confirmed that the old wizard wasn't perfect. He had made mistakes with Sirius, and Sirius had spent nearly a decade paying the price. They couldn't let anything happen to Harry.

Speaking of Sirius, he had been far too quiet since hearing about Harry, and that was never a good sound. Remus glanced round and found him staring straight ahead. His hands were still clenched around the bars, but his face held absolutely no expression.

The sight made Remus' stomach clench. Sirius was brilliant and passionate and a hundred other things, but never unemotional. Never like this.

""Sirius?""

Sirius didn't move. Remus took a step closer, and still not even a flicker.

""Black,"" Alastor barked. ""You in there?""

A low rattle of a breath escaped Sirius' lips. ""Harry's missing?""

Remus exchanged a look with Alastor, and saw his own wariness echoed in the Auror's scarred face. ""Albus thinks he's fine,"" he said. ""Just...lost.""

Sirius' jaw clenched until Remus could hear his teeth grinding, but he said nothing. Alastor folded his arms. ""We'll find him,"" he said gruffly. ""In the meantime, I'll talk to the boss and get a trial sorted.""

Something flickered in Sirius' eyes, something that made Remus stiffen. ""Sirius, we can't get you out without a trial. I'll keep looking for Harry, but you can't do anything until then."" He hesitated, asking Sirius to stay out of trouble was like asking the sun to stop, but it wasn't like Sirius could do anything. ""Don't panic,"" he settled on, finally. ""We'll get you out of here as soon as you can.""

Sirius nodded tightly, but otherwise didn't respond. Remus bit his lip hard enough to draw blood, and stepped up to the bars. ""I'll find Harry,"" he said fiercely. ""I swear it.""

The look in Sirius' eyes was really starting to scare him. Remus was just drawing in breath to try again when Alastor caught his shoulder.

""Think that's enough for one day,"" he said. Under the harsh tones was an unmistakeable undercurrent of concern. ""Being in here affects their ability to concentrate. Best leave him be.""

""Best to leave him with Dementors?"" Remus repeated.

Even with Alastor's Patronus, he could feel the foul things pressing at the edges of his mind. It had been hard enough to imagine Sirius in here when Remus was convinced he was a mass-murderer and traitor. Now it went against every fibre of his being to leave an innocent man here.

""I know, lad,"" Alastor growled. ""Believe me, I know. Which is why the sooner we get back and get things in motion the better."" His voice dropped further. ""And we need to start looking for Potter.""

Still Remus hesitated, torn between his loyalty his friend and to Harry, but before he could wrestle too much with the problem a harsh rattle interrupted him.

""Go, Moony,"" Sirius rasped. ""Find Harry. Find him. Find Harry, you hear me? Find him!""

""I will,"" Remus promised. ""I swear, I will.""

But Sirius barely seemed to hear him. He continued to thrash against the bars, his voice rising in a barely-human howl that made Remus flinch away. He didn't protest when Alastor nudged him back in the direction of the entrance, but his need to find Harry crystallised into something much fiercer.

He would find Harry. He would get Sirius out. Then there would be hell to pay.

For eight years, Sirius Black had been able to think of nothing but his own innocence. His own survival. It was the only thing he could do. The Dementors had sucked him dry of happy memories. All there was was the crushing knowledge that he had failed, that James and Lily had died because of his arrogance, that Peter had betrayed them...

But then Remus was there, and Moody, and they were talking about a trial but Sirius stopped caring about that the moment he mentioned Harry.

Harry was supposed to be with Petunia. Harry was supposed to be safe.

Harry wasn't with Petunia. Harry wasn't safe.

For the first time in eight years, Sirius Black focused on more than just survival. James had trusted him, and he had failed. He wouldn't fail again. Remus and Moody believed him, but Sirius knew better than anyone how useless the Ministry was. He couldn't rely on them. And no matter how hard he tried he couldn't remember if he had actually told them that Peter was still alive.

He would just have to take matters into his own hands.

Albus was seriously beginning to wonder if Hogwarts had gained a second poltergeist.

The explosion over the summer. The exorcism of Professor Binns. Now, he could add the destruction of the broom shed to his list. Once again there hadn't been the slightest tremor from the wards, and the perpetrator had left no clues as to their identity. Whoever was responsible for this was growing to be a serious threat to his school.

And yet...

No one had been harmed. Binns had left of his own volition. The fire that had consumed the broom shed had been set in the dead of night, and hadn't even scorched the grass. In both cases, things had actually turned to the students' benefit. Binns had been a loyal friend, but there was no denying that young Belinda was a far superior teacher. Students were even staying awake in class now. And Rolanda had been ecstatic over the opportunity to get the students decent brooms. Poppy had been equally delighted; the number of first years due to visiting the Hospital Wing due to accidents caused by faulty brooms had already dropped dramatically.

Albus removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. What they were dealing with wasn't a poltergeist. If anything it was the complete opposite. Something that was breaking both rules and laws with equal abandon, but always in ways that benefitted the students of Hogwarts.

After spending decades as a teacher, Albus had thought that nothing could surprise him. Hogwarts clearly loved proving him wrong. Fawkes let out a gentle trill, and Albus reached up to stroke his feathers. His friend dipped his head to nuzzle his cheek, and Albus let the song soothe his nerves.

""What are we going to do, Fawkes?""

Fawkes hummed again, and at the same moment the fireplace flared green. Albus rose to his feet, Fawkes hopping to his shoulder as he did so, and as he crossed the room Fudge's panicked voice rang through the room.

""Albus, are you there? I need you here as soon as possible! Something terrible has happened!""

""How did they turn only their skin pink?""

Cedric laughed. ""No idea, but I suspect it involved getting on the house elves' good side."" He shook his head. ""They'd better not make a habit of it, or Helga will kill them.""

Harry had to smile. As much as the twins' antics got on his nerves, he couldn't deny that they had a talent for pranks. ""I doubt she'll be too impressed,"" he agreed. ""She wasn't when I gave them that potion to make your hair stand on end.""

""I knew that was you!""

Dodging hexes was tricky when one was laughing their head off, but Harry managed. Cedric glowered at him. ""You're a menace. Still.""

'I am sorry to interrupt,' said Hogwarts gently. ""But something has happened.'

The laughter died immediately. ""What's wrong?"" Harry demanded. ""Is there danger?""

'No, or at least no immediate danger. The Headmaster has been summoned to the Ministry of Magic. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban.'

Harry frowned, but it was Cedric who voiced the question on both their minds. ""Who the hell is Sirius Black?""


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

Cedric loved the ceiling of the Great Hall. It had taken the four of them nearly two years to perfect, but the effort was well worth it. Even now, centuries later, the magic blazed as brightly as it had when Hogwarts first opened, and Cedric could quite happily spend hours just watching the results of their hard work.

He was rather less happy to do so when he was desperately awaiting a letter, and the post was late. He had garnered a few curious looks from his friends over the course of the meal, but for once Cedric was too impatient to do more than nibble on an apple. He needed that letter. He had to know what was going on.

Someone clapped him on the shoulder, and Cedric's wand was in his hand before he knew what was happening.

""Woah, easy there! No enemies here!""

Cedric's cheeks burned, and he stuffed his wand back in his robes. ""Sorry,"" he said. He was on the verge of offering an excuse, but at that moment he happened to glance up and what came out his mouth was, ""Did the Weasley twins get you?""

The girl blinked, then burst out laughing. ""No, this is all me. I'm a Metamorphagus.""

Cedric watched in fascination as her hair cycled through a startling range of lengths and colours before finally returning to shoulder-length emerald green. She grinned and stuck out a hand. ""I'm Tonks.""

""Cedric,"" said Cedric, shaking it. The name rang a bell, and he placed it a moment later. ""Do you know Charlie Weasley?""

""Ever since first year,"" said Tonks, with a nod. She cocked her head to one side. ""Cedric...Yeah, he's mentioned you. Actually, I think I've heard Runcorn talking about you, and now I get why. Those are some good reflexes you've got.""

Cedric rubbed the back of his head. ""We can thank Fred and George for that.""

It wasn't a complete lie. The twins did provide a certain challenge. Tonks just snorted. ""Yeah, I can imagine. So what had you so distracted anyway? Everything okay?""

Cedric smiled. Tonks was far from the first older Hufflepuff to check in on the younger ones. ""I'm fine thanks, just waiting for a letter from my dad.""

Tonks nodded, her hair darkening slightly. ""If you say so. If you ever want to chat or anything, you know where to find me."" She grinned suddenly. ""And if you ever need a break, I do a mean Snape impression.""

""Pun intended?"" Cedric asked.

That earned him another explosive snort. ""Happy accident."" Her currently violet eyes flickered up, and she nudged him. ""And it looks like you're in luck.""

Cedric followed her gaze, and brightened at the sight of the owls soaring into the Great Hall. It was impossible to pick out a single owl among the hundreds of birds overhead, but a moment later Athena swooped down to land next to him. Cedric stroked her speckled plumage.

""Hi, girl,"" he said softly. ""Are you all right?""

He held up a piece of bacon, which she accepted with a grateful hoot. Tonks leaned forwards. ""She's beautiful. Is she yours or the family's?""

""Family,"" Cedric told her. ""We've had her for nearly three years now."" Athena hooted again and nibbled gently at his fingers before extending her leg to let Cedric untie the reassuringly thick letter. ""Thanks,"" he said. He passed her another piece of bacon, and gave her final scratch. ""Go and get a good rest.""

Athena needed no further encouragement. Cedric turned his attention to the letter, his heart racing at the sight of his father's elegant cursive. This might be exactly what they needed, and he had to show Harry as soon as possible. He shoved the letter into his pocket and swung his legs over the bench, only for Tonks to catch his arm.

""Hey, hold up,"" she said. ""What about breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day, you know.""

Cedric fought back the retort that sprang to his lips, and grabbed a piece of toast from the table. ""I know, but I have to check this. Thanks, Tonks.""

He was off and running before she had a chance to protest. A couple of his friends called out questions, but Cedric ignored them. He squeezed through the groups of students talking in the Entrance Hall, but before he could take refuge in one of the secret passages a lanky form planted itself in his path.

""There you are, Cedric. I've been looking for you.""

Cedric had to bite his cheek to keep from cursing. Percy pushed his glasses up his nose, his brow furrowing into a frown. ""Are you all right?""

""I'm fine, Percy,"" said Cedric quickly. He offered the older boy a smile. ""Just wanted to answer a letter before Transfiguration.""

Percy nodded, but his blue eyes didn't leave Cedric's and Cedric had to fight the urge to fidget. He knew how smart Percy was, and he also knew that he was far more perceptive than the twins gave him credit for. Cedric forced his best innocent look to his face.

""Is something wrong?""

""Why don't you tell me?"" said Percy.

Cedric bit his lip. He should have known that Fred and George would call in reinforcements. Percy sighed, and gestured for him to move over to the wall, away from curious ears. ""I know you're excited to be here,"" he said. ""And you've got your own friends, and you're doing your own thing, but Fred and George seem to think that you're trying to ignore them.""

""I'm not,"" Cedric insisted. ""Well, not really,"" he amended, when Percy raised an eyebrow at him. ""We just seem to keep missing each other.""

The lies sat uneasily on his lips, but there wasn't much he could do about it. It wasn't like he didn't want to spend time with his friends, but they were annoyingly sneaky and they knew him well. They would be able to tell he was hiding something, and then it would only be harder to spend time with Harry. After all the years apart, Cedric didn't want to risk that.

But he also couldn't keep avoiding Fred and George. His new friends deserved better than that.

""I'll try and catch up with them later,"" he said finally. He ran a hand through his hair, and offered Percy a sheepish smile. ""I guess I got a bit caught up in being here.""

Percy's somewhat severe expression softened. ""That's understandable. I was the same way when I first got here. And don't worry about Fred and George. They just miss you.""

Cedric could only nod. Percy clapped him on the shoulder. ""Well, good. And if you ever need anything, you know where I am."" He started to turn away, then paused. ""Oh, Cedric, you haven't seen Scabbers around, have you?""

""Scabbers?"" Cedric repeated. ""No, sorry. Has he gone missing?""

Percy nodded, his face falling. ""I'm afraid so. I haven't seen him since Monday.""

Cedric frowned. He knew the Weasleys' situation, and for all that Scabbers was just an old rat the whole family was very fond of him. ""I'll keep an eye out,"" he promised. ""I'm sure he'll turn up.""

""Thank you,"" said Percy, with a sigh. ""And you'll remember what I said, won't you?""

""Yes, Percy,"" said Cedric quietly.

""All right then. Now hurry up and see to that letter. You don't want to be late for McGonagall.""

Cedric gave an exaggerated shudder at the thought, and dashed off with the sound of Percy's laughter ringing in his ears.

Cedric's own spirits weren't quite as high. Maybe he had spent so much time trying not to neglect Harry that he had ended up neglecting his friends. It wasn't a feeling he liked. He would have to find a way to do better.

Cedric shook his head sharply. He could work things out with Fred and George later. Right now, he and Harry had other work to do.

His lungs were burning by the time he reached the seventh floor, but Cedric didn't care. He and Harry had done what investigating they could, but neither Hogwarts nor the ghosts had been unable to tell them much. Just the fact that Black had been best friends with James Potter had been enough to get them invested though, and Cedric had reached out to the best source he knew. Hopefully it would be enough to keep Harry from doing something rash.

For once the piles of rubbish were nowhere to be seen. Instead, there were the remains of several wooden training dummies, and a Harry that was unable to sit still.

""I tried to talking to Helena again, and Edmund,"" he said, as soon as Cedric entered, ""but they couldn't tell me much else."" He shook his head. ""This would be much easier if they weren't so isolated from even their own houses.""

Cedric grimaced, but he could see why the two ghosts would value their privacy so highly. He held up the letter. ""Hopefully we'll get something here.""

Harry brightened and shot to Cedric's side so they could read it together. He let out a low whistle at the multiple sheets that spilled out. ""How did they get all this information?""

""My dad hears everything,"" said Cedric, with a smirk. ""Everyone trusts Hufflepuffs."" Harry snorted, and Cedric continued, ""and he's been working there for years and knows where to get the best gossip.""

Harry grinned, but it quickly faded as he scanned the letter. ""They're reopening the case, they're advocating for a trial, and he still escaped? Why?""

Cedric shook his head. It didn't make much sense to him either. Harry swore under his breath in Arabic and started pacing.

""Do you think he did it?""

""Murder a dozen Muggles? No,"" said Cedric. He plucked the letter from Harry's hands, and glanced over it. ""And common consensus in the Ministry seems to be that it was this Pettigrew as well.""

That raised even more questions, considering Pettigrew had also been a friend, but Black was the priority and Cedric kept reading, ""Moody is the driving force behind the re-examination, and he's one of the best Aurora in the country, and the other friend, Lupin, is convinced that Black is innocent...""

His voice trailed off as he reached the last page of the letter, ice spiking through his stomach, but Harry was still preoccupied.

""Then why was he in Azkaban? With Dementors? I know things must have been chaos, but it's bad enough that criminals are sent there, let alone innocents! How was this not discovered sooner?""

Cedric said nothing. Harry spun back, eyes narrowing, and Cedric sighed.

""There's something else,"" he said quietly. He handed over the last page. Harry glanced at it, then the temperature in the room suddenly dropped. His hands clenched into fists, and Cedric rescued the letter before Harry crushed it.

Harry barely noticed. ""Godfather. He's my godfather.""

Cedric set the letter down, and wrapped Harry in a tight hug. He said nothing, but he could feel Harry trembling against him and ran a hand through his friend's messy hair.

""He was innocent,"" Harry hissed against his chest. ""He was innocent, and he spent eight years with Dementors, and no one cared. And I was stuck with..."" He trailed off with an incoherent snarl.

Cedric hugged him tighter. ""A lot of people care now,"" he murmured. ""Even if people are offended by his escape, he's already spent eight years in there for a crime he didn't commit. Of course if he handed himself in he could prove his innocence and be cleared faster, but-""

""But that would take time, and he's already spent years there,"" said Harry bitterly. He shifted, and when Cedric let him go he immediately started pacing again. ""How did this happen? We were both...None of this should have happened!""

Cedric said nothing. All the anger that had been building over Black's false imprisonment had doubled at the revelation that he was Harry's godfather. Harry could have had had a safe, happy childhood with someone who loved him. Instead they had both been alone.

Judging from the faint breeze tugging at his hair, Harry was all too aware of that. When he finally turned back, his green eyes were flashing. ""If I broke out of prison, the first thing I'd do would be to find someone who could help. Someone I trusted.""

Despite the situation, Cedric couldn't help a grin. ""If? That's exactly what you did do.""

Harry rolled his eyes, but a smile twitched his lips at the memory. ""And I was perfectly correct to do so, wasn't I?"" He shook his head, smile fading. ""The point is, if I were Sirius Black, and the one friend I had left had recently visited me in prison and believed my story, I know what I would do.""

""Agreed,"" said Cedric, with a nod. ""And it would be perfectly reasonable for you to write to a close friend of your parents asking for information about your newly-discovered godfather.""

Harry blinked. ""Write? Don't I need an address? I know nothing about Lupin.""

Cedric shook his head. ""I asked my Mum about it ages ago. They used to use loads of spells to make it easier for post birds to find recipients, and over time the magic just got bred into them. A name is all they need."" He crossed the room to clap Harry on the shoulder. ""And Hogwarts has a lot of owls for any student to use.""

It sounded like a perfect plan to him, but Harry hesitated. ""Wouldn't that be strange? For them to just hear from me out of the blue?""

""I suppose so,"" Cedric allowed. ""But do we have any better ideas?""

Harry scowled, But said nothing. Cedric glanced at his watch and winced. ""McGonagall's gonna kill me. Look, they won't be able to track you, especially not here. It might be worth a try. I've really got to run, but think about it, all right?""

""Fine,"" Harry muttered.

Cedric hesitated. Something was wrong here, but even as he opened his mouth Harry shook his head. ""I'll think about it. Now go on, before you're late.""

There was no arguing with that expression. Cedric gave him another quick hug, then ran for the door. He really hoped McGonagall was in a good mood. Between Harry, the twins, and Sirius Black Transfiguration was going to be a nightmare.

But despite himself, Cedric was in good spirits as he took the steps three at a time. Harry had a godfather. He had people that knew his father, and wanted the best for him. There was a chance for him to have a happy home, and if Black really was innocent then Cedric would do everything in his power to see them reunited.

They both deserved it.

Amelia Bones was one of the most formidable witches of her time. Albus had been aware if that ever since she passed every one of her first year exams with the highest marks seen in years. The rest of her time at Hogwarts, and her later career as an Auror and Head of the DMLE, had only cemented her reputation as a witch who was not to be crossed.

This wasn't the first time Albus had ended up in her bad books, but he had never seen her look quite this furious.

""July.""

Albus nodded. Amelia's lips were a thin line. ""A boy has been missing for five months,"" she said, and the ice in her voice made a winter at Hogwarts seem mild. ""Were you ever planning on informing us?""

Albus sighed. ""The particular circumstances-""

""Damn the circumstances,"" Amelia snapped. ""I don't care if it's the Boy Who Lived or the Queen of Sheba, if a child is missing you don't spend months trying to investigate discreetly at the cost of the child's safety!""

Albus opened his mouth, then closed it again. There was very little he could say to that. Scrimgeour pushed himself off from the wall and limped forward.

""Do you have any leads?""

His amber gaze was just as intense as Amelia's. Albus sighed. ""I'm afraid not. None of my suspects even knew Harry was missing.""

Scrimgeour exchanged a grim look with Amelia, but before either of them could say anything Alastor cleared his throat. ""And now Sirius Black does too.""

Albus closed his eyes for a moment. One more mistake to add to a lifetime of them. He looked up in time to see Scrimgeour scowl. ""Just what we needed,"" he muttered. ""But you can hardly blame the man.""

""Certainly not,"" said Albus quietly. Sirius would never abandon James' son, not even if the cost was his own freedom.

Amelia straightened, and all eyes returned to her. Her sharp gaze travelled round the room, before finally settling in Albus. ""We are going to find both of them,"" she said grimly. ""Potter and Black. And you, Albus, are going to tell us everything you know.""

Instincts born of a lifetime of discretion blazed up, but Albus forced them down. Harry was more important. Alastor grunted approval, but Scrimgeour quirked an eyebrow. ""And what are we going to tell the Minister?""

Alastor's face creased into a fierce scowl. ""We tell him and we tell Malfoy,"" he spat. ""And all the rest of his Death Eater chums.""

""We are fortunate that the information is currently contained,"" said Albus. If the revelation had been made anywhere other than Azkaban then they might have been in serious trouble, but as it was he was reasonably confident that they were the only people in the Ministry who knew that Harry Potter was missing.

Of course, that state of affairs was not going to last. Not with the sheer number of Death Eaters and sympathisers in the Ministry. All they could do was try to minimise the damage, and find Harry as soon as possible. Albus could only pray that they wouldn't be too late.

""That looks painful, Uncle.""

Harry spared his niece a small smile. ""I think I'd rather face a troll.""

One didn't have to talk to trolls. Honestly though, Harry would take anything over this. He had already spent most of the morning staring at the piece of blank parchment Cedric had left him, and he was still no closer to working out how to begin.

Helena floated down next to him.

""Would you like some help? I didn't really know any of them, but they were somewhat noticeable over the seven years they were here.""

She had told them as much earlier, and Harry certainly wasn't going to turn down any help. ""Thank you."" He sighed, twirling his quill between his fingers. ""I don't even know where to start.""

Helena raised an eyebrow. ""You could introduce yourself?""

Harry snorted. ""I wouldn't believe that.""

""You're the most paranoid person in history,"" said Helena dryly. She shifted so that she was sat perfectly poised in midair. ""I expect simply telling the truth about what living with your relatives was like would be sufficient. Lupin and Black must have met them at some point.""

Harry nodded, but didn't move. Helena cocked her head to one side, then her eyes suddenly widened. ""Uncle...""

""Never mind,"" Harry muttered.

It came out a little more curt than he had intended, but Helena didn't move. She started to reach for him, before breaking off with a frustrated huff and shaking her head.

""Uncle, those four were inseparable,"" she said gently. ""Black is your godfather. You know they would want to hear from you. No, they will be desperate to hear from you.""

Harry's throat was too tight to answer. Helena touched his arm, scowling when her hand passed straight through. ""Uncle...""

""The Dursleys hate me.""

The words stung, but Harry couldn't hide from them. They were his family, and they had never wanted him. Maybe it was irrational, but even the thought that his godfather might react the same way...

""Black won't,"" said Helena fiercely. ""He doesn't, and Lupin doesn't.""

""Helena-""

Then he broke off with a hiss as Helena shoved her whole hand through his chest. The icy cold left him gasping, and Helena glared at him.

""The Dursleys are nothing,"" she spat. ""Don't you dare try to deny yourself happiness because of them."" Her voice softened slightly. ""Please, Uncle. You know better than this.""

Harry stared at her, then at the quill he had crushed in his hand. She was right. Cedric was right. Black and Lupin had cared about his father. They had to care about him too.

He took a deep breath, and repaired the quill with a thought. He had to try. He dipped the tip in the ink, forced himself to ignore the way it was shaking, and started to write.

Remus sat in what passed for a park in central Birmingham. The moon hung in the night sky, close enough to full that Remus couldn't ignore the deep itch beneath his skin but he remained still. A few Muggle teens hovered by the entrance, but some primal instinct made them keep walking. Remus settled back against the bench and waited.

Hours passed. Remus burrowed deeper into his threadbare coat, but otherwise didn't move. If he had learned anything over the years it was patience. It wasn't the first night he had waited out here. If it wasn't the last, then so be it.

Then something moved in the shadows.

Remus rested his hand on his wand, but otherwise didn't move. The shape coalesced into an enormous black dog which padded forward and came to a stop just out of arm's reach. Clear grey eyes met Remus', and for the first time in a long time Remus let himself relax.

""You got my message then.""

The dog cocked his head to one side, tongue lolling out happily as he nudged Remus' knee with his nose. For a moment it was almost like they were teenagers again, and Remus was watching his friends mess around with their Animagus forms. He smiled, and pushed himself to his feet.

""My flat isn't far. We've got a lot to talk about.""

Sirius gambolled around like a puppy as they made their way through the silent streets. Remus couldn't blame him. He got restless enough if he stayed inside for a few days, let alone...

Remus shook himself. If he started thinking about what his friend had endured then he wouldn't get anything done. Sirius paused, ears twitching in his direction, and Remus forced a smile.

""It's nothing. Not far now.""

Sirius gave a soft huff, and stuck close to his side for the rest of the way.

It was late enough that even the student that lived above him were quiet. Remus locked the door, and by the time he turned back Sirius was standing in his human form. For a long moment they stared at each other, then Sirius gave a crooked smile.

""Good to see you without bars in the way, Moony.""

And in an instant it was like nothing had changed and Remus pulled his friend into a tight hug

Finally, Sirius drew back, and though he was smiling there was a fierce glint in his eye.

""Now,"" he said. ""How are we going to find Harry?""

Remus had expected nothing else, but he had to ask, ""Are you sure you don't want to prove your innocence first? If you turn yourself in now-""

""I'll spend weeks stuck in a holding cell while they re-examine all the evidence and argue about whose fault it is that I never got a trial before,"" Sirius interrupted. ""Hell no. They don't need me for that. Harry does.""

He looked at Remus although daring him to argue, but Remus just smiled. ""I couldn't agree more. Come on, I've got Firewhiskey waiting."" He paused. ""Perhaps a bath first though.""

Sirius barked a laugh, and Remus' smile widened as the world seemed to settle back into place. They would find Harry. Merlin help anyone who got in their way.

Thanks for reading! Any feedback would make an awesome birthday present! ;)

A stuffed head went flying through the air, and Cedric lowered his aching arms.

""All right,"" he gasped. ""That's enough for now.""

Harry nodded equally breathlessly, and set his own sword down to go and retrieve his knives. There was a deep scowl on his face. ""I am so out of shape.""

A house-elf appeared with a jug of water and glasses, and vanished before Cedric could do more than nod at them. He poured himself a drink, and handed another to Harry. ""You're nine,"" he said. ""No one's expecting you to be in shape.""

Harry's scowl deepened. Cedric couldn't exactly blame him. He used to be able to fight for hours, and now a short spar was enough to leave him out of breath. He put that thought from his mind with a shake of his head. Times had changed, and they were in perfectly adequate condition for their age. They had time to get stronger.

Harry still looked furious with himself, and Cedric bit back a sigh with an effort. Salazar had always expected too much of himself. This time though, Cedric suspected that more than his physical capabilities were bothering him.

""You'll hear from Remus soon.""

Harry went perfectly still. Cedric set his glass aside to squeeze his shoulder. ""You will,"" he repeated. ""They care about you.""

""You don't know that,"" Harry muttered, but he leaned into Cedric's touch. ""They might have more important things to worry about. Black has been in Azkaban for years, he's going to need a long time to recover, and they're good friends so he'll need Lupin to help him...""

""Harry,"" Cedric interrupted gently. ""Please. They will be glad to hear from you. I know it.""

Harry's face clearly betrayed his skepticism, but he said nothing. Cedric glanced at the clock and sighed. He would have to come back to this later. ""I'm sorry, but I need to go. I need to talk to the twins at breakfast.""

He had spent the night thinking about what Percy had said, and had come to the inescapable conclusion that the older boy was right. Fred and George deserved an apology, if not an explanation. It wasn't their fault that Cedric was still working out how to balance his past and present lives.

Harry just nodded. ""It's about time."" He hesitated, eyes dropping to his knives with studied fascination. ""I promise I'll be better about it this time.""

Cedric crossed the distance in two quick strides and drew him into a hug. ""We'll both be better,"" he corrected.

Harry didn't even pretend to fight against his grip. Cedric took a deep breath, letting his friend's presence soothe his nerves, and finally straightened. Before he could move away though, Harry caught his shoulder.

""Fred and George will understand,"" he said softly. ""They've known you for years. You'd have to do more than avoid them for a few weeks for anyone to give up on you.""

Warmth flooded Cedric's chest. He didn't have the words, but Harry's face twitched into the soft, genuine smile that only a few ever had the privilege of seeing, and Cedric knew he understood. Harry nudged him. ""Go on. You're supposed to be the brave one here.""

""Thanks,"" said Cedric dryly. ""I'll see you later.""

""This evening,"" Harry clarified. ""You need to spend lunch with people your own age."" His green eyes glinted mischievously. ""All you old people need to stick together.""

""Cheeky sod,"" said Cedric, through a laugh.

He was still smiling when he entered the Great Hall. For all that Godric had made it his mission to keep Salazar from the darkness, Salazar had been just as determined to look after Godric. It was good to know that nothing had changed.

For now though, Cedric had other friendships to work on. He saw two heads of bright red hair bent together at the far end of the table, and redirected his steps. A couple of his Hufflepuff classmates called out greetings, but while Cedric waved back he kept on track. He could catch up with his housemates after he had fixed things with Fred and George.

George was the first to notice him, and nudged his twin, but neither said anything. Cedric came to a stop opposite them.

""Good morning.""

Fred scowled. ""Sorry, do we know you?""

That was fair enough. Cedric sighed. ""I'm sorry. Can we talk?""

The twins exchanged a look, then George's frown relaxed ever so slightly and he kicked the bench out. ""It's about time.""

It was more of an opening than Cedric had expected. He sat down, and took a deep breath. ""I'm sorry I've been so distant,"" he began, but that was as far as he got before a snort interrupted.

""You've not been distant,"" Fred snapped. ""You've been avoiding us.""

Cedric bit his lip. ""I had some stuff to deal with. Stuff I had to deal with on my own."" He looked down. ""I know I should have been more open about it, and avoiding you both wasn't the right way to deal with it-""

""Of course it wasn't,"" George interrupted. ""If you were having problems then we would have helped!""

Fred was nodding. ""You should have just talked to us.""

""I know,"" said Cedric. ""And next time I will.""

The twins exchanged one of their long, inscrutable looks, but just as Cedric was starting to get restless their faces split into identical grins. ""Okay then.""

Cedric blinked. ""I'm sorry?""

He was used to apologies being a lot more complicated than that. Rowena was prickly, Salazar could be an absolute nightmare, and even Helga knew how to hold a grudge. There was always a fair amount of debate required for anything beyond a minor dispute.

But maybe he shouldn't be surprised. They were talking about eleven year old Weasleys, Weasleys that Cedric had known for most of his life. Maybe things didn't always have to be complicated. Fred rolled his eyes.

""You were a git, you know it, you're not going to do it again, we're all good.""

""Anyway,"" said George. ""We've got bigger problems, and you're just the wizard we've been looking for.""

Cedric frowned at the pair of them. ""What's going on?""

The twins exchanged another look. Fred looked one way, George the other, then both of them leaned in towards Cedric, grins nowhere in sight. ""We need to do something about Snape,"" said Fred.

Cedric blinked, then nodded. ""He has been a bit harsh lately.""

The twins snorted, and Cedric grimaced at his own words. Harsh was the understatement of the century. Snape had always been unnecessarily sharp, but over the last week or so he had become downright brutal. Potions was becoming universally hated amongst the student population; Cedric's fellow Hufflepuffs dreaded Snape's classes, and he had heard even sixth and seventh year students stressing out about Potions in the Common Room.

""He made Alicia cry the other day,"" said George. There was no trace of his usual good humour to be seen in his face. He nodded down the table to where a group of first years were huddled over homework. ""She didn't do anything wrong, she was just smiling, and he went mental. It's not right.""

""Percy's complained to McGonagall,"" Fred growled. ""So did Charlie, and the other prefects, and no one's doing anything! So we're going to instead.""

Cedric sat back and looked at them. He recognised the set of their jaws, and the gleam in their eyes. They were going to do this with or without him.

Godric had spent his life fighting people who hurt others. Cedric couldn't do that yet, but he was very capable of helping his friends mess with a bully. He smiled at the twins.

""What did you have in mind?""

Harry didn't even try to stay in the Room of Requirement. He didn't have the fresh ingredients he needed to make really interesting potions, and digging through piles of rubbish wouldn't be enough to distract him. For a moment he considered taking one of the new school brooms for a test flight, but reluctantly dismissed that idea, at least until later that night.

Physical activity was good though. Cedric's words from the morning rang in Harry's ears as he slipped the best of the knives into his robes, but he squashed them down. He wasn't going to over-exert himself, but a change of scenery would do him good. Avoiding attention, and anything that wanted to eat him, while training would just make things more interesting.

Anything to stop himself from dwelling on the letter he had sent.

Getting out of the castle was insultingly easy. If not for his unique skill set, Harry would be seriously worried about their students. He was annoyed to find that the tunnel that came out closest to the Forbidden Forest had collapsed at some point in the last centuries, but at least it would give him and Godric something to do if they ever got bored. Not today though. Harry had a desperate need to throw sharp things around.

A Disillusionment spell got him safely to the forest, but Harry found himself pausing as he stepped beneath the trees. The forest had always been dangerous, they had placed it out of bounds for a reason, but now it felt different. There was a darkness here that he hadn't felt before. He reached for his wand, and grabbed a knife in his other hand. For a moment he reconsidered this plan, but stubbornness kept him in place. There was no concrete danger, and he could Apparate back to the castle whenever he wished.

Well, he had wished for a good distraction.

Mind made up, Harry started to make his way deeper into the forest. He kept his wand in his hand and his senses stretched as far as he could manage, but he found himself missing the further reach of the wards. They really had degenerated terribly over the years. As soon as he was stronger, and he had a properly matched wand, he was doing something about that.

Harry finally came to a halt in a small clearing about half an hour's walk from the castle. It was far enough that he shouldn't be disturbed by anyone from the castle, but not deep enough in for the Dark creatures Harry knew lurked in the forest to be disturbed by him. He swapped his wand for another knife, took a deep breath, and sprang into action.

Remus had always prided himself on the speed of his reading. He might not have had the raw genius of James and Sirius, but he had gone through books the way his friends went through Chocolate Frogs. By the time he got to seventh year Madame Pince had actually stopped glaring whenever he visited the library.

He had been staring at the letter in his hand for most of the morning.


Remus Lupin,



My name is Harry Potter. I've heard that you were friends with both my father and Sirius Black. Sirius Black, who I've just found out is my godfather.



If this is the case, then I want to know why he spent eight years in Azkaban for a crime that he may not have committed, leaving me stuck with my Muggle relatives.



I should say at this point that I am no longer living with the Dursleys. They didn't love, like, or want me, and so I left. You don't need to worry about me, I'm in a safe place, but I am not going back there. All I want now is to understand why all this happened.



I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this letter. I am not going back to the Dursleys.



Harry Potter


Remus didn't know what to think. He had spent so many weeks going out of his mind looking for Harry, spent so many sleepless nights imagining what could happen to a lost child, let alone the Boy Who Lived...

He was barely aware of the door being thrown open and slammed shut, but Sirius' strident tones were impossible to ignore.

""Hallo, Moony! I found these in the corner shop. Not Firewhiskey, of course, but it'll smooth the way-""

""Sirius!""

Remus didn't often raise his voice. There was a crash of cider bottles being dropped, and the alacrity with which Sirius appeared would have been gratifying on any other day. He appeared in the doorway a moment later, eyes flashing with worry in his gaunt face.

""Remus, what-""

""Read it,"" Remus growled.

He thrust the letter into Sirius' hands, and stalked to the window. He had to get control over his emotions. If he couldn't then Sirius...

""What the fuck?""

Remus' hands clenched on the windowsill. He could feel the wood splintering under his grip, but even over the blood pounding in his ears he could hear Sirius' voice growing louder and more strident.

""He left? He ran away? He's nine, where the fuck could he have gone? We have to find him Moony-""

""We're going to,"" Remus bit out, but Sirius was still in full swing.

""He says he's safe, but how can we know that?"" He was stalking up and down the room now, kicking aside any chairs unfortunate enough to be in his path. ""He must be somewhere in the magical world if he knows what's going on with me-""

""Except there's a serious problem with that,"" said Remus quietly. ""Harry doesn't know anything about magic.""

Petunia had admitted to keeping his heritage a secret from him. In any other circumstances Remus would have had something to say about that. Sirius spun back, eyes blazing, then his cheeks flushed as he understood.

""Why was he left with those bastards in the first place?""

""Someone,"" Remus bit out, ""thought it was a good idea."" He looked up, and from the way Sirius' eyes widened guessed that the wolf was showing. ""And there's only one person with that kind of faith in people.""

Sirius went perfectly still, and then it wasn't just Remus' magic filling the air. His hands clenched into fists. ""Dumbledore.""

It came out more as a growl than any human noise. Not that Remus was one to talk. He thought of Dumbledore leaving Harry alone with Petunia, a family who hated him so much that he had run away from home, and his vision went red. He doubled over, years of self-control warring with pure rage, and couldn't suppress an incoherent snarl.

""Remus?""

The back of the chair split under Remus' grip. Splinters dug into his fingers, and the sharp stinging was enough to break him from his haze. Anger wasn't doing them any good here.

""Sorry,"" he managed. ""I'm fine.""

""I'm not,"" Sirius shot back. ""What the hell was Dumbledore thinking?""

Hearing the Headmaster's name made Remus want to break another chair, but he forced the impulse down. ""We've got to stop this,"" he forced out. ""Getting angry isn't going to help Harry.""

Sirius' aura of murder faded slightly, but he was still fuming. ""I know, but how could he leave him with that old hag? No, fuck it, that's an insult to hags!"" He ran a hand through his shaggy hair. His cheeks were still flushed, but even as he looked down at the crumpled letter in his hand his scowl faltered.

""Fine. You're right. But they're going to pay for what they did. And someone's going to answer for Harry being there.""

Remus nodded curtly. He was hardly going to argue with that. Sirius took a deep breath, and smoothed the letter out.

""So if Harry doesn't know about magic, then how did he write this?""

There was a long silence. The air was still charged with magic and emotion and it was suffocating. Remus kept thinking about Harry, had to keep thinking about Harry to keep rage from overwhelming him, but that only led to more questions. He rubbed a shaking hand over his eyes.

""He could have found some of Lily's old things,"" he began, but Sirius was already shaking his head.

""You think Dursley would leave anything like that in the house? No, someone must have gotten to him.""

Remus eyed him. ""Sirius...""

""A Death Eater,"" Sirius growled. The crazed light was back in his eyes. ""One of those scumbags must have found out where he was staying, they got into his head, they took him-""

""Sirius,"" said Remus sharply. ""We don't know that.""

""What else could it be?""

""I don't know!""

That admission left the two of them staring at each other, until Remus finally looked away. ""He says that he's safe. And he wants to know the truth about you. I think that's a good sign.""

Sirius cocked his head to one side. ""Death Eaters would know that I wasn't one of them,"" he said. ""But they haven't told Harry. They must still be working on him.""

Remus raised his eyes to the ceiling. Azkaban had done nothing for his friend's ability to leap to conclusions. Or to think rationally. ""Why don't we assume, for now, that Harry is, as he has said, safe and well and not under Death Eater influence? I'm not saying we just leave it,"" he added, when Sirius opened his mouth, ""but we shouldn't jump to the worst conclusions with no evidence.""

Sirius snorted. ""Why not? Everyone else does."" He folded his arms, scowl deepening. ""So what do you propose we do?""

Remus gave him a grim smile. ""What do you think? We write back.""

It was only when he missed his target completely that Harry finally came to a halt. It was far sooner than he had planned, but he was shaking with exhaustion and he had to sit down before his knees buckled. Maybe he had pushed himself too far. Not that he would ever admit it to Cedric. He sagged back against a tree trunk, throat burning as he sucked in breath. Next time he would have to bring water. And think everything through a bit better.

Harry let his head fall back against the tree with a thud. Physical exhaustion lent a curious mental clarity. He didn't have the energy left to worry about what Lupin and Black thought of him. He had done what he could, just as he was doing everything he could to get into fighting shape. That would have to be enough.

Harry took a deep breath, and pushed himself to his feet. Everything ached, and his throat was dry and scratchy, but he felt better. He would be doing this again, albeit with a little more planning. Maybe he would bring Cedric with him too next time. His senses prickled, and Harry shivered. Bringing Cedric was sounding like an increasingly good idea. There was something in the forest, something Harry had never experienced before, and he didn't think he wanted to meet it alone.

That thought was enough to have Harry moving back towards the castle as fast as he could manage. He wasn't scared exactly, but he wasn't in any condition for a proper fight.

Fortunately, Harry arrived back at Hogwarts without further incident. Unfortunately, his journey to the kitchens was interrupted by a commotion in the Entrance Hall. Harry ducked into one of the secret passages to get a better viewpoint, wary of the number of students gathering, but the screeched insults that came to his ears froze him in place.

""-slimy Slytherin scum!""

Harry's heart dropped into his stomach, but the Slytherins were already on the offensive, ""Look at that, more Gryffindors who can't tell us apart.""

""What's to tell? You're all Muggle-born hating gits! Gonna join your dad in Azkaban, Travers?""

""Don't talk down to me you arrogant Mud-""

""Rictasempra!""

The slur was lost in a burst of forced laughter, and any further comment was drowned out by the sound of more hexes being thrown. Feeling sick to his stomach, Harry sagged against the wall.

He had known things at Hogwarts were bad. He had heard as much wandering the castle, and Godric had confirmed it, but to hear the hatred in the students' voices, their inability to see the other as anything more than a mortal enemy...

This wasn't what they had wanted. Hogwarts was a sanctuary, a family, somewhere people could come and be themselves and feel safe. This wasn't that. Hogwarts was divided, at war within itself, and if children couldn't contain their hatred then Harry dreaded to think of what the rest of the wizarding world must be like.

After a minute's stewing, Harry risked a glance out the passage. Teachers had arrived to break up the fight and the crowds were already dissipating, but one lingered. Cedric was staring after the two culprits as Flitwick led them away, and the expression on his face made him look far older than his years. One of his friends called and he turned away, determination smoothing into an age-appropriate grin, but Harry had seen it and his own resolve hardened.

They would fix this. They had to.

 

Cedric shook his head, and grabbed the scrap of parchment.

""No no, a potion wouldn't be any good. He's a Potions Master, if he's going to be on guard for anything it's that, and he'd probably be able to taste anything different straight away.""

George's eyebrows shot up. ""You think he can do that?""

Cedric, who had watched Salazar identify minuscule amounts of poison hidden in even the strongest wines, nodded. ""No point risking it, is there?""

""It would be a waste if he realised straight away,"" Fred agreed ruefully. ""Shame, we found some great stuff in Bill's old books.""

Cedric shook his head. For all that the twins didn't seem to give a toss about their classes they didn't express even the slightest uncertainty about attempting advanced level potions. He couldn't wait to introduce them to Harry properly.

""Keep those in reserve,"" he said. ""Snape isn't the only one we might need to go after.""

The confrontation he had witnessed in the Entrance Hall was still fresh in his mind. It was deplorable behaviour from all involved, and Cedric had a strong suspicion that more than a few students would need a little extra incentive to change their ways. At least they would be easier to get to than Snape.

In the meantime, Snape was still a problem. George scratched the back of his head with his quill.

""Getting to him at all is gonna be the tricky bit,"" he said. ""You know what he's like in class, he sees everything.""

Fred scowled. ""We're going to need a distraction. A big one.""

""That's easy enough,"" said Cedric. If nothing else he knew how to cause chaos. He could be sneaky when he needed to be, long association with Salazar had taught him that much, but big and loud was much more in character for an eleven year old. The twins were no slouch in that department either. ""We need to think of something to actually do.""

""Something embarrassing,"" said Fred fiercely. ""Something that'll make him feel as rubbish as he made Alicia feel.""

George was nodding. ""Something that will show everyone just what a colossal git he is.""

Inspiration struck. ""Why don't we do just that?""

The twins exchanged a long look, then cocked their heads in unison. ""'I am a colossal git',"" said Fred, rolling the words around in his mouth. ""That has a nice ring to it.""

""Not that everyone doesn't already know, but they should at least be able to see him coming,"" George agreed. ""Bit of colour would make a change.""

Fred had snatched the parchment back and was scribbling away. ""Can't forget the glitter. Wonder if we can add sound effects?""

Cedric had to laugh at the image. When it came to causing mischief, the twins were in a league of their own. ""I'll look into it. I know a few older students, and people will be less suspicious of me asking than you two.""

Fred and George snorted in unison. ""Yeah, make the most of that while you can,"" said Fred. ""They'll soon see your true colours.""

Cedric certainly hoped not, but he kept smiling. ""Dunno what you're talking about."" He glanced at his watch. ""Speaking of which, I should go. It's group study night with the sixth year prefects tonight, and I want to check some Transfiguration stuff with them.""

George raised an eyebrow. ""Would this be the third year Transfiguration that McGonagall gave you 'cause you'd finished everything else?""

""How-""

""We overheard her gloating about you in the staff room,"" said Fred, with a wicked grin. ""I reckon she's gonna propose soon.""

Cedric's cheeks burned, and he kicked at Fred's chair. ""Shut up. She's a good teacher.""

""Yeah, yeah, we know. Just saying, we're not the only ones who wish you were in Gryffindor.""

Cedric smiled. At times he missed his house, but every time he saw how surprised people were when they realised he was a Hufflepuff he knew he had made the right choice. He was where he was needed. He pushed himself up, and nodded to the twins.

""Well, I'm happy where I am. And I've got Tonks in my house, and if anyone knows how to really annoy Snape it'll be her.""

Both Fred and George lit up at the thought. Cedric started to leave, then paused. ""Has Percy found Scabbers yet, by the way?""

George shook his head, smile fading. ""No sign of him. It's really weird. He was fine last year, and first year.""

""Percy's pretty upset about it,"" said Fred. ""We've even stopped teasing him about it.""

Cedric sighed. ""Sorry to hear that. I'll keep an eye out.""

He might be just a rat, but Percy really cared about him, and the rest of the Weasleys would miss him too. It was a pity Hogwarts wasn't actually omniscient. They would just have to keep an eye out. Cedric shook himself, waved goodbye to his friends, and headed back out into the school.

Alastor had rolled his eyes so many times in the last hour that he was giving himself eye strain. For a wanted man, Black was doing a terrible job of staying out of sight. Alastor had arrived intending to quiz Lupin on Black's whereabouts, but after seeing the man stroll out of the door bold as brass he had decided a sharp warning was in order.

After all, not all Aurors would be content with a friendly chat with a wanted criminal.

If he was being honest with himself, Alastor would rather hand Black over to the Ministry himself. Enough evidence, and public outcry, had arisen to get him a trial, and Alastor was confident that Black would be acquitted.

But there was the matter of Harry Potter. If his disappearance was what had inspired Black's breakout, and Alastor couldn't think of anything else that would inspire such a reckless action, then his own freedom would be the last thing on Black's mind. Talking to him before contacting the Ministry was the least Alastor could do.

Off-tune whistling announced Black's return. Alastor checked the surroundings out of habit, but kept his normal eye focused on Black. The man still looked terrible, not that Alastor was really one to talk, but he had put on a little weight and his hair had been trimmed to fall about his shoulders. Living with Lupin had done some good, even if the two of them were still idiots.

Alastor gave them another couple of minutes to get comfortable, then stomped across the road. He released his wand from its holster and flicked it at the door, which promptly exploded inwards. Startled shouts met his ears, and he allowed himself a grin before raising his wand.

For all that neither of them had seen combat in years, Lupin and Black both reacted promptly. That wasn't good enough. Two Full-Body Bind curses hit their targets, two wands flew to Alastor's hand, and two bodies hit the floor with a crash. Alastor stomped over to glower down at them.

""Constant vigilance!""

If looks could kill, Black would have accomplished what many Death Eaters had tried and failed to do. Lupin looked equally outraged, but when Alastor relaxed the spell enough for them to speak he held his tongue.

""What the hell, Moody?"" Black demanded. ""Are you trying to kill us?""

""Try the opposite,"" Alastor growled. He released the pair of them with a wave of his hand and folded his arms. ""For an escaped convict, you're terrible fugitive.""

Black staggered to his feet. ""No wonder they call you Mad-Eye now,"" he growled. ""Don't you know how to knock?""

""Don't you know that wanted men don't go wandering around Birmingham?"" Alastor shot back. ""I thought you at least had more sense,"" he added, switching his glare to Lupin, who had the grace to look slightly abashed, but it was Black who snorted.

""Sit in a cell for eight years and then see how much you want to stay inside.""

Alastor rolled both eyes as far as they would go, which was considerable. Azkaban had done nothing for Black's self-control. Lupin somehow managed to stamp on his foot while maintaining an expression of perfect apologetic innocence.

""We will be more careful,"" he said, over Black's splutters.

""No one noticed,"" Black muttered. ""You're just paranoid.""

""It's not paranoia if it's justified,"" Alastor snapped. ""If I can notice, then Death Eaters can too, and they won't restrict themselves to Body-Bind Curses. You've got to get a grip.""

Black's eyes flashed, but a warning look from Lupin kept him quiet. Lupin turned back to Alastor. ""Can we assume, from the lack of any other Aurors, that you are not going to be turning us in?""

Black's hand twitched in the way that would have made any Auror jumpy, and Alastor tightened his grip on their wands. ""No,"" he said curtly. He hesitated, but he needed their assistance and he wasn't going to get that without some display of trust. He set the wands on the table, and nodded approvingly when both wizards summoned them without taking their eyes from him.

""Why not?"" Black asked. ""What do you want?""

""The same thing you do,"" said Alastor quietly.

He didn't need to say anything else. Both Lupin and Black tensed, and exchanged a series of increasingly complicated looks before Alastor snapped his fingers in front of them.

""Yes, I'm talking about Potter,"" he growled. ""Far as I can tell, he's the only reason you wouldn't wait for us to go through the proper channels.""

Black glared at him. ""Of course I couldn't wait, Harry's gone! He could be anywhere, anyone could have him-""

""Sirius,"" said Lupin. ""Stop it. We're going to find him.""

Alastor studied them. Black was beginning to look as crazed as he had in Azkaban. Lupin was steadier, but there was something in his eyes, a sharpness to his movements that made all of Alastor's instincts flare.

""You know something,"" he said.

Black flinched, but Lupin's eyes narrowed. Neither of them spoke, and Alastor's own irritation spiked. He folded his arms, and focused both eyes on the pair of them. ""You're both terrible at hiding things,"" he said flatly. ""Remember that there is a child's safety at stake, and tell me what you know.""

""And then you finish with a a flick to the side, like this.""

Aldane Summerby looked doubtful, but he watched Cedric's movements closely. The fireplace burst into flame, and Cedric let it burn for a minute before extinguishing it. ""Go on, give it a try.""

Al half-heartedly copied the action, and Cedric wasn't surprised when nothing happened. He nudged his friend. ""It's not gonna work if you give up before you start.""

""Easy for you to say,"" Al muttered. ""You're great at this. You're great at everything.""

Cedric bit his lip. He could hardly say that he had a full lifetime of experience behind him. He scratched his head. ""No I'm not, I just like Charms. You'll get it, I know you will. Just try it one more time.""

Al sighed, but raised his wand again. He opened his mouth, and Cedric quickly added, ""And this time, really believe you can do it. Think of the best fire you've ever seen, think of how it feels and smells, concentrate just on that, and then breathe it out.""

Al eyes him, then closed his eyes. He was silent for a moment, brow furrowed in concentration, and he took a deep breath. ""Incendio.""

Sparks shot from the tip of his wand, and flames burst into life. Cedric let out a delighted laugh and clapped him on the back. ""See? I knew you could do it!""

Al stared at the flames, then at Cedric, a brilliant smile spreading across his face. ""I did it.""

In the warmth of the fire and Al's achievement, Cedric let his worries about Harry and the twins and Snape fall away. This was the moment he had loved most when teaching, and he had missed it. ""That was great,"" he said. ""You just need to have more confidence in yourself.""

Al ducked his head. ""I guess so. Thanks, Ced."" He looked back at the fire, and shook his head. ""I can't wait to show this to my cousins. They don't start school 'til next year, and they're gonna be so jealous.""

Cedric laughed. ""Probably. Are you seeing them over the holidays then?""

""Yep,"" said Al, with a nod. ""We're all heading back to Trinidad for Christmas. It's going to be great, even if there's no snow there."" He glanced back at Cedric. ""What about you? Are you going home for Christmas?""

Cedric opened his mouth, then hesitated. As much as he wanted to see his family, leaving Hogwarts meant leaving Harry to yet another lonely Christmas. He couldn't do that, but his parents would want to see him, and he didn't have any good reasons to stay at Hogwarts...

""Cedric? Are you okay?""

Cedric shook himself, and summoned back his grin. ""Yeah, course. Just started thinking about Christmas dinners. I've missed Dad's cooking.""

Al hummed. ""Tell me about it. The house-elves are great, but I don't think they've ever heard of doubles."" At Cedric's confusion he waved a hand. ""I'll ask Mum to send some. And some chutney. Maybe some kachori too."" He turned mournful eyes on Cedric. ""It's been months. I miss home cooking.""

Cedric studied him. Al had always been quiet, but Cedric hadn't realised he was homesick. He should have known better. He had always been better at looking after his students before. Being distracted by Harry and the twins was no excuse.

""You'll be back in a couple of weeks,"" he said. ""Have you been writing to them?""

The flames were dying in the grate as Al shrugged. ""Yeah, but it's not the same. I just, I haven't been away from home for this long before.""

Cedric chewed on his lip for a moment, but before he could say anything Al shook his head. ""But I'll be seeing them soon, and it'll probably get better. Anyway, thanks for your help, Cedric.""

There was an uncomfortable feeling in Cedric's stomach as he watched watched Al gather up his books and vanish down the passage to the dormitories. He should be better than this. He was one of the Founders of Hogwarts, and being a student himself didn't mean he could ignore his responsibilities. He would have to do more.

""You did well there.""

Cedric looked up in time for Tonks to drop onto the sofa next to him. Her hair was bright turquoise today and tumbled down her back in messy curls. Cedric rubbed the back of his neck. ""I didn't really do anything.""

""Don't sell yourself short,"" said Tonks. ""Teaching is way harder than doing it yourself, and I've done enough tutoring to know that for certain."" She cocked her head to one side. ""You seem to have a knack for it though. Have you ever considered teaching?""

Cedric couldn't help smiling. ""A bit. It's really nice seeing other people get it.""

Tonks grinned back. ""I know what you mean. If I hadn't got the Herbology grades for the Aurors then I was thinking about it myself.""

""You're applying for the Aurors?""

Cedric didn't know why he was so surprised. Then again, the whole concept of having a branch of the government dedicated to defending people was still something of a novelty. He thought about it a bit more and nodded. ""Being a Metamorphagus won't hurt your chances.""

""Definitely not,"" Tonks agreed, and there was a flicker of approval in her voice s she looked at him. ""Most people have said I'm crazy for going for it.""

""Some people say the same thing about wanting to teach,"" said Cedric with a grin. He opened his mouth to start to lead into the spells he'd need to teach Snape, but then he caught a glimpse of the clock and had to abruptly change track. ""Um, I need to meet someone, but are you busy over the weekend? I've got a couple of questions about stuff.""

Tonks' eyebrows shot up. ""Have they given you third year work to do or something? 'Cause I can't imagine you needing help with anything below that.""

Cedric hesitated, but she was going to find out sooner or later. ""No, it's not for school. It's for a project. With Fred and George.""

Tonks' eyes lit up. ""Say no more. I've got a study group in the morning, but grab me after lunch on Saturday, okay?""

""Perfect. Thanks, Tonks.""

""Any time. Don't do anything I wouldn't do til then!""

Cedric laughed, and darted out of the Common Room before Gabriel Truman could notice him. It was technically before curfew, but the prefects were protective of the first years. He had to dodge a few more of them on the way to the seventh floor, but that was something he could do in his sleep.

It wasn't enough of a challenge to keep his mind from drifting. He had no idea what he was going to do about Harry over Christmas, he had Snape to deal with, he was still furious with himself for not noticing that Al was struggling, and they still hadn't heard anything from Lupin and Black...

Harry took one look at him and shook his head.

""What's the matter now?""

""Nothing,"" said Cedric automatically, then winced when Harry's eyes narrowed. ""Everything's fine, I promise.""

""If that's true, then you wouldn't look that stressed,"" Harry shot back. He set his book aside, and crossed the room to take Cedric's shoulders. ""Let me help.""

Godric had never been able to keep anything from Salazar. Nothing had changed. ""It's nothing important,"" he mumbled.

""If it's worrying you, then it's important.""

Cedric hesitated, but he knew better than to assume Harry would drop the subject. He settled on the first topic that came to mind. ""It's one of my housemates,"" he said. ""He's been getting really homesick.""

Harry cocked his head to one side. ""Understandable, but I don't see why-""

""I should have noticed, and helped him out!""

""You did notice,"" said Harry dryly.

""Only when he came out and told me!"" He broke away from Harry's grip and started pacing. ""What kind of teacher doesn't recognise when one of their students is that miserable?""

""The kind that is an eleven year old student himself.""

Cedric opened his mouth, but Harry didn't give him a chance to say anything, ""You're not a teacher, Cedric. You're not even an adult. You're a first year student, and you're already dealing with more than any of them realise.""

That was true, but it also didn't change anything. Once again though, Harry got there first, ""And if I'm not allowed to take responsibility for what Dark wizards have done in my name then you aren't allowed to take personal responsibility for every child in this school. At least not yet."" He caught Cedric's arm, green eyes softening. ""You're only a child yourself. You can't keep going like this.""

Cedric wanted to argue. He wasn't only a child, he was one of the reincarnated Founders of Hogwarts. He should be better than this.

And yet, Cedric couldn't deny that he was exhausted. Juggling his new life, Harry, and maintaining his secrets had been difficult. Adding anything else would be a lot. Godric had never been one to shy away from a challenge, but there was only so much one person could do, and no matter how much he knew there was a limit to what an eleven year body could handle.

Some of his thoughts must have shown on his face, for Harry gave him a small smile.

""We will make things better,"" he said. ""But we will do it together. I promise.""

Cedric said nothing, but allowed himself to be guided over to the sofa. ""All right. I'll try to remember. But there's something else I wanted to talk to you about.""

Harry nodded, then paused, eyes narrowing. ""Would this have anything to do with the fact that the holidays start in three weeks?""

""How did you-""

""You're not the only person I talk to, you know. I think Helena's learned the school sessions by now.""

Cedric snorted. ""I should think so."" He hesitated, amusement fading. ""Harry-""

""You need to go back to your parents.""

Cedric stared at him, but Harry met his gaze steadily. ""It's too early to make them suspicious. I can't go there, even under a false name it would make things complicated later on. I'll be fine, it's not like I've ever done much for Christmas.""

""We used to,"" said Cedric quietly. They hadn't had many traditions, but they were cherished ones and he had missed them.

Harry's smile faltered for a split-second before he shook his head. ""One day. When Helga and Rowena are here, and I've 'reappeared'. We can work something out then. For now...""

His words made sense, but Cedric hated it. Harry deserved a decent Christmas. There had to be something he could do...

""Anyway, I can give you your present before you go.""

Cedric blinked, then smiled. ""It won't be the same, but fine. But we will have a proper Christmas as soon as we can.""

Harry just leaned into him a little. Cedric wrapped an arm around him, his heart feeling slightly lighter. Salazar had always been good at putting things into perspective for him. He glanced round the room, lingering on the pile of things Harry had deemed useful. It was considerably larger than it had been that morning, and Cedric frowned at it.

""Nothing from Lupin then?""

Harry stiffened slightly, and he gave a half-hearted shrug. ""If I got a letter like that I'd want to think about it too.""

Cedric just hugged him tighter. Harry didn't make a single noise of protest. Knowing it was time to change the subject, Cedric settled on something a bit lighter.

""Snape is still being a pain in the neck. I've been talking with the twins, but if you've got any ideas...""

He refused to flinch when an unholy gleam lit Harry's eyes. Salazar had never tolerated cruelty to children, especially coming from someone who was supposed to be protecting them. That person also being the head of Slytherin only added fuel to the fire.

""I could fill his office with acid,"" Harry mused. ""Guaranteed to eat through his furnishings, and resist basic and advanced cleaning charms for at least a week. I can even make it smell like dragon dung.""

Cedric smothered a laugh with a cough. ""Just his office?""

""I'm not going to subject our students to that,"" said Harry indignantly. ""Leave his classroom out of whatever you're planning.""

""I don't know, a couple of days off from lessons won't do anyone any harm. Honestly, we could use a break.""

He meant it. Half his housemates were on the brink of a nervous collapse, and Snape's temper was only going to get worse after they started their campaign. A few days break would do everyone good. Harry hesitated, scowl slipping into understanding.

""I suppose some of it could get in the classroom,"" he said. ""But not while there are students there.""

Cedric just about resisted the urge to roll his eyes. ""Of course not.""

Harry nodded, and continued to mumble increasingly unpleasant potion effects under his breath. Cedric leaned back on the sofa. He might have unleashed a monster, but it was better than thinking about Lupin and Black.

Alastor hadn't moved since reading Harry's letter. Even his magical eye was fixed on the piece of parchment. He also hadn't said a word, and Remus' anxiety was rising with every passing minute.

He didn't know what he would do if Alastor decided to interfere. The old Auror was brilliant, and had already demonstrated the ability to withstand both Remus and Sirius. If he did decide to go to the Aurors, or Dumbledore, then their chances of stopping him were slim to none.

But that wouldn't stop them from trying. Harry had reached out to them, and only them, and Remus would die before betraying that trust. Sirius was a coiled spring next to him, his magic humming in the air, and Remus could smell his rising agitation. Alastor had fought alongside them during the war, had saved both their lives, but Harry was family. Harry came first.

Alastor huffed out a sigh, and Remus' grip tightened on his wand. The magical eye spun round to glare at them.

""You two don't do things by halves.""

Remus didn't move. Alastor's voice gave nothing away, and his scarred face was impossible to read. Sirius let out a low growl.

""Harry's in trouble, damn it!"" he snarled. ""Are you going to help us or go running back to Dumbledore?""

""Sirius,"" Remus hissed. There was nothing to be gained from antagonising an Auror. Both of Alastor's eyes were locked on Sirius now.

""Watch your mouth, lad,"" he growled. ""If I didn't care about the boy you'd be in front of Amelia Bones right now.""

Sirius' breath hitched, and Remus caught his arm before he could do something stupid. He ignored the betrayed look that earned him, and focused on Alastor. ""Does that mean you're not going to tell them?""

Alastor gave a low, rumbling sigh. ""I should. The more of us working on this, the better."" Sirius twitched, but Alastor silenced him with a scowl, ""And more of us will put Potter in danger. It's a miracle the news isn't out already.""

""What are you suggesting?"" said Remus quietly.

Alastor didn't reply straight away. His magical eye spun back to the letter in his hand. ""Do you think this is genuine?""

Remus' heart skipped a beat. ""I think so. Petunia... Well, I wouldn't blame him for running.""

""I still think it's a Death Eater trick,"" Sirius muttered.

""We've already talked about why that makes sense,"" Remus shot back, without looking at him. ""I think it's real,"" he continued, keeping his eyes on Alastor. ""I don't know where he is, or how he got away, but the only way we're going to find out is by making him trust us.""

""And you're not going to manage that with the Aurors involved,"" Alastor finished.

Remus just nodded. Sirius was still fuming next to him, but it was silent sulking and Remus would take it. Their immediate priority was keeping Harry's contact secret. They could argue about the rest later.

Finally, after several long minutes, Alastor shook his head.

""Albus isn't going to like it.""

""Serves him right,"" Sirius growled.

Alastor snorted, and refocused on Remus. ""Keep me informed. And be careful.""

Remus closed his eyes in relief. It wasn't much, but it was a start.

Harry stood at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. He had given in to the demands of the season and was wrapped in two of the warmest and least moth-eaten cloaks he could find in the Room, but the Scottish winds still left his teeth chattering. He took a moment to erase the last of the tracks he had left in the snow, squared his shoulders, and set off into the trees.

Ten minutes in, Harry suspected that he had made a mistake. The same feeling of menace that had dogged his earlier visit was back. All Harry's instincts urged him to turn back, to get to Cedric, to get somewhere safe, but the moment he thought of that the ever-burning resentment flared up brighter than ever.

Lupin and Black should have written back by now. It had been nearly two weeks. It didn't take that long to write one letter. Basic etiquette hadn't changed that much. They should have written back.

Part of Harry's mind, the part that his old masters had created and the Dursleys had nourished, asked why would they want to? They had their own lives, and Black certainly had his own problems. Harry knew Dementors, and he could hardly blame Black for not feeling able to deal with his dead friend's son.

He still could have written.

Harry kicked a frozen branch out of the way with a scowl. Stewing inside the castle had been unbearable, but the cold wasn't doing much for his mood either. What he really wanted to do was fly, but he would be far too conspicuous in the daylight. Exploring the forest, and trying to work out exactly what was wrong, was the next best option.

He hadn't told Cedric. They had planned to do this together. With the wards in the state they were, if there was something dangerous in the forest then they needed to identify and neutralise it as soon as possible, and considering neither of them were older than thirteen trying to do it alone would be completely stupid.

Harry wasn't stupid, but he did need to do something. If nothing else, a little reconnaissance couldn't hurt.

Snow crunched behind him and Harry spun round, wand raised, only to freeze in place.

""Peace, young one. We mean you no harm.""

Harry relaxed immediately, pocketing his wand and bowing low. ""Forgive me. I did not know that I was trespassing on your lands.""

The larger of the two centaurs snorted, one hoof pawing the ground, but the one who had spoken continued to watch him. Her grey eyes, the same shade as her hair, were completely unreadable. ""You should not be here.""

Her words resonated on so many levels that Harry had to take a moment to respond. ""I apologise. I...I felt something."" He shook his head. ""I will not trouble you again.""

""Good,"" the black-haired centaur rumbled, but the other held up a hand.

""Enough, Bane. There is more at stake here then some petty trespasses."" The corner of her mouth twitched. ""We have a distinguished visitor with us after all.""

Harry's heartrate tripled. ""I-I'm just a student,"" he began, but the words trailed off when the centaur raised an eyebrow.

""You are not.""

Harry swallowed. The centaurs of his time had always known far more than they should, and said even less. It seemed that nothing had changed. He knew better than to try to lie, and instead changed the subject, ""There is something else in here. I felt it. Do you know what it is?""

""That is none of your concern,"" Bane snapped. He drew closer to the female centaur. ""This is a waste of time.""

Harry tried not to bristle. ""I know there's something dangerous in here.""

""That is why they call it the Forbidden Forest, is it not?"" the female centaur murmured.

""That's not good enough,"" Harry insisted. ""I know I'm not the first student to find their way in here."" His hands clenched into fists. ""Hogwarts is supposed to be safe. Why hasn't anything been done about this?""

""As if they could,"" Bane muttered. He looked Harry up and down and snorted. ""And you came in here alone? Humans grow more arrogant every year.""

""No,"" said the other centaur, before Harry could respond. The odd glint, almost amusement, was back in her eyes. ""The outcome would be less than certain.""

Harry's stomach was bubbling with nerves. He swallowed hard, and the centaur took pity on him. ""No one should be in this forest alone, even one such as you.""

Harry nodded jerkily. All desire for a fight had fled. The centaur took a step forward and gave a slight bow.

""I am Aeldra. We will meet again, Harry Potter.""

Harry's jaw dropped, and by the time he recovered Aeldra and Bane had vanished back into the forest gloom.

For a minute, Harry could only stand there. He knew how powerful Divination was, one couldn't live with Rowena for decades and not know that, but it had been a long time since he had seen anything that precise. Knowing his name was one thing, knowing that he wasn't the apparently-normal student he appeared to be... They even seemed to know that he wasn't the only one.

Harry sucked in a shaky breath. The centaurs knew too much, but he also knew them. They had barely trusted humans in the past, and judging from Bane's hostility things had only gotten worse. They weren't going to tell anybody else. Not yet anyway.

Still, Cedric deserved to know. Harry turned on his heels and started making his way back towards the castle as fast as he could. Aeldra's words about the danger in the forest rang in his ears, and pushed him on. He had been right, there was danger here, more than there should be, but if Aeldra was right then he couldn't handle it alone. It stung, but he needed help.

Either that or wait until he was older and stronger, but that wasn't an option when there was a danger to their students so close at hand.

Harry shook his head. He was in danger of doing exactly what he had warned Cedric against, taking too much responsibility upon his own shoulders. For now, he would talk to Cedric about the centaurs, and they would work out what to do together.

Getting back into Hogwarts was easy. He scrambled out of the passage and dropped to the floor, but as he turned to make his way back up to the seventh floor a commotion around the corner made him pause. Unable to resist, he made his way down the corridor and peeked over the bannister. A gaggle of students were passing on the stairs below him, and he caught snatches of conversations.

""-you see him?""

""Hard to miss the sparkly pink robes!""

""And they sing!""

""I was there, he was right in the middle of screaming at this little Ravenclaw when it happened. You should have seen his face, it was awesome!""

Harry withdrew. Apparently the first part of the twins' assault had been a rousing success. Some of the amusement was a touch mean-spirited, but after everything Cedric had told him of Snape's teaching methods Harry couldn't bring himself to care. Someone who had spent years tormenting their students could deal with a bit of payback.

Of course, now that the first stage of the prank was in place, it was time for Harry to do his part. He turned back to the Room, a smirk spreading across his face. This was going to be fun.

It wasn't unusual for Severus Snape to be in a bad mood. It was far more unusual, in fact, to find him content with life in any way shape or form. Albus was used to that, and could even understand it to a certain degree. Unfortunately, recent circumstances had left his Potions Master in an even more destructive temper than usual. Albus had fielded complaints from prefects of all four houses, but by the time he found time to speak to Severus their students had taken matters into their own hands.

Albus knew better than to admit it to anybody, but the discordant screeching woven into the spellwork had been very neatly done. The whole ensemble was impressive, and certainly more creative than anything he had seen in some time. He suspected that some of their new arrivals had been involved. It had also proven surprisingly difficult to dispel, requiring not only Albus' input but that of Filius as well.

Needless to say, Severus had not been in the mood to appreciate their students' ingenuity. The chaos later discovered in his office had not helped. Nor had having to use Bubble-Head Charms until they were finally able to remove the worst of the mess.

Albus was expecting explosions as he entered the dungeons. At the very least there would be demands for expulsions, probably mixed in with a few demands to let Filch deal with the culprits as he saw fit. And Severus certainly was furious, Albus could see it in the flash of his black eyes and the bitter tang of magic in the air, but there was something in the way he stood that made Albus pause just inside the doorway.

""Severus? Is everything all right?""

The look Severus gave him could have melted a dragon's hide, and Albus quickly amended his statement, ""Besides the obvious?""

Severus' lip curled, but he jabbed a hand at the congealed mess. ""I have been analysing this...concoction.""

""Ah. And your conclusions?""

Severus didn't reply immediately. Instead he waved his wand and a small beaker floated across the room. Albus took it, and a closer examination confirmed his initial suspicions.

""This is liverwort. Not an ingredient usually found in these sorts of potions.""

""Precisely,"" Severus bit out. ""Liverwort hasn't been used like this for centuries, not since some North American species of hornwort were proven to have greater efficacy with far fewer complicating effects. I have never seen a potion of this composition.""

""And you would not have taught anyone to do so,"" said Albus quietly.

Severus jerked his head. There was a muscle twitching in his jaw, and for once Albus had to admit that his agitation was quite justified. None of their students could have made this. The only instructions Albus could think of that called for this type of liverwort were found in a book dating back to the 1200s that he had seen in Nicholas' collection. Even a particularly enterprising student would have difficulty accessing that.

""It is possible that some of them did extensive research,"" he began, but Severus interrupted with a snort.

""Headmaster, I am aware of the capabilities of every potions student in this school. While there are a select few that might have the forethought to use an uncommon catalyst, this potion is beyond anything that any of them could have accomplished."" Black eyes bored into Albus. ""And may I remind you that it is not the first time that magic beyond the capabilities of any student has been performed within these walls.""

The whole situation suddenly became far less amusing. Albus remembered the explosion of magic over the summer, the exorcism of Binns, the destruction of the broom shed, and took a deliberately slow breath.

""It does bear a certain resemblance to previous attempts,"" he said quietly.

The other incidents, bar the first, had seemed to benefit the students. Considering the foul mood Severus had been in, and the fact that this prank had both amused the students and granted them a brief reprieve, Albus was willing to concede that it may be the same culprit. The why, and more importantly the who, remained frustratingly elusive.

""What is going on, Headmaster?"" Severus demanded. ""Who is doing this?""

""I do not know,"" said Albus quietly. ""But it cannot continue.""

This person might be working on behalf of the students, but their actions were raising questions that Albus could not answer. The one thing he did know for certain was that they were powerful and intelligent and appeared to have free access to Hogwarts. They threatened the wellbeing of everyone in his school, and Albus could not stand by any longer.

Harry was bored. Brewing Snape's potion had been a good distraction, but with that done and the Forest currently out of bounds he was beginning to get restless. Cedric had had to skip their early morning training session thanks to a double-length Astronomy class, and Harry was still waiting for a chance to tell him about the meeting with Aeldra. He was not looking forward to it.

That left Harry with nothing to do except tidying, which he was running out of patience for, and he was getting incredibly fed up with the preponderance of Christmas decorations. He had no objections to the holiday in principle, but the festive atmosphere only served to remind him that he would be spending yet another Christmas alone. He had done his best to make light of it, not wanting to burden Cedric any more than he had, but he couldn't say he was looking forward to the coming two weeks.

It might have been different if Lupin and Black had replied, but he didn't let himself dwell on that.

""Knut for your thoughts, Uncle?""

Harry forced a smile. ""I'll spare you them, Helena. What did the students think of the pranks?""

Helena eyed him, but accepted the subject change with good grace. ""They loved it. Some are worried that Snape will get even worse in retribution. I doubt it though,"" she added quickly, when Harry frowned. ""The Headmaster usually steps in when he gets this many complaints, and enough prefects have spoken to him that he's aware of the matter.""

""Then he should have done something about it,"" Harry muttered.

Helena gave a slight shrug. ""Don't look at me, I agree with you. I've seen too many Ravenclaws dreading Potions lately. As far as I'm concerned, Snape deserved everything he got.""

Harry smiled, but the approval didn't do much do lift his mood. They were sequestered at the back of the library, away from prying eyes, and he plucked a book from the shelves at random. ""I hope he's learned his lesson.""

Helena said nothing, and instead continued to watch him. Harry attempted to focus on the book but couldn't get past the first few pages before his attention started drifting. He hated feeling this way.

""You know you didn't do anything wrong, don't you?""

Harry's head snapped up. Helena met his gaze steadily, and he had to clear his throat before he could reply, ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Ghosts didn't need to sigh, but Helena did so anyway. ""I know you, Uncle, and I've looked after students here for nearly a thousand years. You are not the only one to wonder why a loved one never reached out.""

""Lupin and Black aren't loved ones,"" Harry snapped. ""I don't even know them.""

""But you could have,"" said Helena gently. ""And they could have been. And it's all right to be angry that they haven't tried.""

Harry's eyes burned. The words in front of him blurred, and he had to swallow down a lump in his throat before he could reply, ""They should have.""

""They should,"" Helena agreed. ""They still might.""

An icy hand touched his shoulder and it took all of Harry's willpower not to flinch. Helena floated closer to him. ""Don't give up yet, Uncle.""

Harry managed a weak smile, but let it fade quickly. At least he had Helena and Godric, and hopefully Helga and Rowena as well. He sighed and straightened up. In the meantime, dwelling on things that he couldn't change wouldn't help. He looked down at the book in his hands, and huffed.

""Please tell me there has been some improvements in literature over the past centuries.""

Helena rolled her eyes and drifted upwards. ""Try some Shakespeare. Not one of the tragedies, that's the last thing you need right now.""

Harry couldn't argue with that. He shoved his book back on the shelf, and pulled down one of the collections of sonnets at random. Helga had always enjoyed poetry. Helena nodded. ""That will do. Let me know what you think, I want to show them to Mother when...when she gets back.""

The hope in her voice was painful. Harry stared down at the book. ""Do you have any favourites?""

The poetry helped. So did the lack of people, thanks to the subtle repelling charm Harry had woven around their little corner. The peace did wonders for Harry's mood, and by the time it came for them to light the candles he was feeling far calmer.

That sense of calm was promptly shattered when Pento the house-elf appeared before them. A letter was in his hand, and Harry froze in the act of reaching for his wand. Pento offered it to him with a bow.

""For you, Master.""

It was several seconds before Harry could bring himself to take the envelope. It shook when he turned it over and he saw his name printed neatly on the front. He had to swallow before he could reply. ""Thank you, Pento.""

The house-elf bowed again and vanished with a faint crack. Harry stared at the letter. He knew who it was from. There weren't many options, and even fewer that Hogwarts would let reach him. What it contained though...

Helena touched his arm, and the cold was enough to bring him to his senses.

""I'll be in the Room.""

He Apparated before she could say anything.

Harry stumbled as he reappeared. The waves of emotion were physically painful, and even as he hunched over Hogwarts' consciousness wrapped around his in a wordless embrace. For a moment Harry allowed himself to bask in her comfort, but the letter was fairly burning in his hands and he had to pull himself away.

All he had to was open the letter. Once he did that then at least he would know, whatever Black and Lupin said. Even a rejection was better than not knowing. Harry could deal with rejection, but not knowing...Salazar had never been very good at that.

And yet his fingers wouldn't move.

Harry forced himself to take a deep, slow breath and then release it equally slowly. His fear was logical. These people were the most personal links he had to his father. As much as he hated to admit it, their opinion mattered. As long as he didn't open it, he didn't have to know that they didn't want him.

A hand rested on his shoulder and only knowing that there was only one person it could possibly be kept Harry from hexing them.

""You haven't opened it yet?""

The letter was still crumpled in his hand. Harry's eyes burned, and he turned to bury himself in Cedric's chest. Cedric's arms came around him immediately, and Harry closed his eyes.

""Did Helena tell you?""

""Actually, Hogwarts did,"" said Cedric. ""I said I wasn't feeling well, no one will notice."" His fingers brushed through Harry's hair. ""How long have you been sitting here?""

Harry managed an awkward shrug. Clearly too long if Cedric had had time to come all the way up here. Cedric sighed. ""You don't have to open it if you don't want to.""

Harry closed his eyes. Cedric's arms tightened around him, but he didn't say anything. For a moment Harry let himself wish that he could let go. Spare himself the pain of yet another rejection.

But Godric had rubbed off on him. Harry took a deep breath and drew back.

""Yes, I do.""

Cedric smiled. He guided them over to a low sofa, keeping one arm around Harry's shoulders the whole time. Harry smoothed out the letter with trembling hands. He allowed himself one more breath, then ripped the envelope open. Two different types of handwriting met his gaze, and he started to read.


Harry,



My name is Remus Lupin. I don't know how you were able to contact me, but I am so, so glad that you did. Your father was one of my dearest friends, and I miss him and your mother every day. 



You asked why you were left with the Dursleys. It's true that Sirius is your godfather, but he was framed by Peter Pettigrew for the murder of twelve Muggles and imprisoned in Azkaban. It was Peter who betrayed your parents to Voldemort. I only learned the truth when I went to ask him if he was responsible for your disappearance. He told me what happened then broke out to find you. He will be getting a trial to prove his innocence, but you are our priority.



I wish I could have taken you in myself, I wanted to more than anything, but I have a condition that renders me an unfit guardian in the eyes of the Ministry. I wish things were otherwise, I wish you had never had to live with those people, but you wouldn't be safe with me.



We are glad you are safe, and understand your caution, but can you tell us anything about where you are and who is looking after you? There are still Death Eaters out there who hate you for what you did to their master, and they will be keen to get revenge. They are everywhere, including the highest levels of the Ministry. Be very careful who you trust.



I'm so sorry for what has happened to you, Harry, but you are not alone. Please remember that. If you ever need us, send word and we will come as soon as we can.



Remus Lupin


Harry had to pause after finishing Lupin's part of the letter. They didn't hate him. They had been worried about him. They wanted him to be safe. Relief left him light-headed, and for a moment he could only sag against Cedric.

""See?"" said Cedric. ""How could anyone not want you?""

Harry shook his head. His vision blurred, and he had to blink several times before he could keep reading. Black's writing was sharper and more angry, and in several places his quill had nearly torn through the parchment.


I'm sorry, Harry, I'm so so sorry. It was my idea to make Peter the Secret-Keeper, I thought it would be the perfect diversion. Peter was weak and everyone knew James was my best friend, and I thought I was so clever but I was wrong. I got your parents killed, and I will never forgive myself.



I'm your godfather. I've been a terrible one so far, but if you ever need me I'll be there. And whatever happens, you will never go back to the Dursleys. I swear it. I know you don't trust me yet, but I will do whatever it takes. You're my godson. I promised Lily and James that I would take care of you, and I'm going to keep that promise.


Harry swallowed. The self-blame and loathing practically poured off the page. He only realised his hands were shaking when Cedric gripped them tight.

""Harry? Are you all right?""

Harry had to choke down the lump in his throat before he could speak, ""He spent eight years in Azkaban. Eight years surrounded by Dementors, believing that he caused the deaths of his best friends.""

Cedric flinched. ""I know.""

""How did this happen?""

Cedric was quiet for a minute. ""It appears this Pettigrew is more intelligent than anyone realised. And wizards...we do like easy solutions.""

Harry looked away. This never should have happened. Black should have had a trial, he should have been freed sooner, he should have been able to look after Harry...

But there was no changing the past. Black was free, the authorities were finally working on getting him a pardon, and Harry was out of the Dursleys' hands. They could only move forwards.

Harry read the letter again. Warmth bubbled up in his chest and he found himself smiling. Black and Lupin cared about him. They were worried about him. The relief was great enough that he could almost forgive them for taking so long to reply. He didn't fully trust them yet, certainly not enough to tell them where he was, but they were trying. It was a start.

Cedric nudged him, and Harry looked up to find a warm smile on his face.

""Feeling better?""

""What do you think?"" Harry muttered, but he relaxed into Cedric's side. Cedric wrapped an arm round his shoulders.

""They sound like good people.""

Harry just nodded. Cedric's grip tightened. ""You deserve that, Harry. More than anyone, you deserve it.""

Harry hesitated, but knew better than to argue. He had Cedric, one day he would have Helga and Rowena, and that was all he needed, but he wouldn't say no to Lupin and Black.

Maybe this would be the last Christmas he spent alone.

Many thanks to mystrangecollectionmaker for all their help with Cedric and his family.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""Are you sure you'll be all right?""

Normally Harry would have rolled his eyes. They had had this conversation far too many times over the last week. Today though, he could only shrug. Cedric ran a hand through his hair.

""It's not too late for me to stay-""

""No,"" Harry interrupted. ""You need to see your parents. I know you miss them, and they'll be missing you too."" He reached up to squeeze Cedric's shoulders. ""It's two weeks. I'll be fine. You go and enjoy yourself.""

Still Cedric hesitated. ""I'll write. And I'll work out a way to visit. I haven't tried Apparating that far, but I can do it in stages."" He nodded to himself. ""Yeah, I'll do that.""

Harry didn't even try to hide the warmth that flooded his body. He couldn't begrudge Cedric the time with his family, but it was good to know that he wouldn't be forgotten. Not that Cedric ever would. Cedric smiled at him, but it soon faded.

""You'll remember what we talked about, won't you?""

Harry sighed. ""I promise I won't go into the Forest.""

Cedric had not been pleased to hear about his adventures. Not because of the encounter with the centaurs, he had been surprised by the accuracy of their Divination but agreed that they wouldn't say anything about it, but he was concerned by the danger that Harry had felt and been warned about. He relaxed slightly at Harry's words.

""We will deal with it,"" he said. ""Together.""

Harry just nodded. He would keep himself busy somehow. Cedric studied him for a moment, then pulled him into a hug.

""It'll be okay,"" he whispered. ""I'll be back in two weeks.""

Harry hugged him back. Cedric was warm and solid in his arms, and Harry breathed in his familiar scent and blinked back his tears. It wouldn't be long. Cedric would write and he would visit and he would be back soon. Cedric's arms tightened around him, but he said nothing and after a long minute Harry pulled back.

""You should go. You'll miss the carriages.""

He was proud to hear that his voice didn't shake. Cedric ruffled his hair. ""Take care of yourself. Keep an eye on Helena and Edmund. You're not alone.""

Harry managed a weak smile. Cedric gave him a final fierce hug and slipped from the room. Harry sank onto the sofa with a sigh. It was going to be a long two weeks.

""Knut for your thoughts?""

Cedric tore his eyes from the rolling countryside. ""I'm sorry?""

Fred nudged his brother. ""Not sure they're worth a knut.""

""Sorry,"" Cedric repeated. He sat up straighter and forced Harry from his mind. ""What were you saying?""

George eyed him for a moment before shrugging. ""Not much. Just wondering if you were planning on gracing us with your presence over the holidays?""

Cedric felt his cheeks warm up. The twins had accepted his apology, but he wasn't expecting them to forget about it any time soon. In fairness, he hadn't been paying attention for most of the journey home.

""Don't worry,"" Fred added. ""We'll stop Ron from pestering you.""

Cedric frowned at them. ""Ron doesn't pester me. And he's the only one of you who can give me a decent chess game, so don't you dare say anything to him.""

The twins rolled their eyes, but Cedric meant it. Ron was a good lad, with an mind for chess that was really remarkable in a boy of nine, and Cedric didn't like how Fred and George could get with him. He scowled at the pair of them until George raised his hands.

""Fine. It'll stop him bothering us anyway.""

Fred said nothing, but there was a glint in his eye that Cedric didn't like the look of. Making a silent promise to keep an eye on Ron over the holiday, he changed the subject.

""Reckon Charlie will be up for a pick-up Quidditch game over the holiday?""

""Definitely,"" said George. ""He says everyone's given him an insane amount of homework because of the NEWTs, but that just means he'll want to get outside more.""

Cedric laughed. Charlie was a good student, but there was a reason he was Quidditch Captain and not a Prefect.

The rest of the journey passed in a blur of jokes and laughter. Some of Cedric's friends from Hufflepuff stopped by, and Fred and George's friend Lee Jordan came by to hang out for a few hours. Cedric threw himself into the conversation and the experience of meeting new friends, but as hard as he tried he couldn't help worrying about Harry. By the time they reached London, he was more determined than ever to find a way to meet up with his friend over the holiday.

""Looks like Ron and Ginny came to meet us,"" said George. He jumped up to wave his siblings at the same moment Fred started to drag his trunk down. They collided with identical indignant squawks, and Cedric caught the trunk with a quick spell before it could squash Lee. Lee let out an explosive huff.

""Thanks, mate.""

Cedric waved off the thanks. Fred and George untangled themselves with sheepish looks and mumbled apologies, and George leaned out the window. ""Can you see your parents?""

Cedric took a quick look around him, then shook his head. ""Dad's probably at work, and Mum doesn't like crowds. She'll be over by the fireplaces.""

""I can see mine,"" Lee exclaimed. He squeezed his way past George to wave, and Cedric stepped back to give them more space. He had to smile at his friend's' excitement. He missed his own parents fiercely, having an adult's memories didn't change the fact that he had the physical body and brain of a child, but he had forgotten what it felt like to be away from family for the first time.

By the time the train finally came to a halt all four boys were ready and waiting by the doors. Cedric actually had to stop Fred from jumping out while they were still moving, something which earned him multiple eye rolls.

""You used to be fun,"" Fred grumbled, but the scowl vanished when two redheads bounded out of the crowd. ""Ginny! Ron!""

Cedric stepped aside to let the twins join their younger siblings. Ginny was picked up and spun around, squealing with laughter, while George grabbed Ron into a rough hug, all four talking at the tops of their voices. Lee grinned as he watched them.

""Wish I had siblings.""

Cedric thought of Harry and Helga and smiled. He nodded past the Weasleys. ""There's your dad.""

Lee was out the train before Cedric could even finish the sentence. Cedric cast a quick glance round, and seeing no one paying any attention to him levitated all four trunks out onto the platform with a silent spell. Being eleven and small and skinny again was a pain. He jumped out of the carriage and immediately felt a tug at his sleeve.

""Cedric, lift me!""

Cedric laughed, and swung Ginny up on to his back. Even as a weedy eleven year old he could manage that. She shrieked with glee, and he laughed. ""Miss me, Gin?""

""More than I missed those two,"" she said impishly, earning indignant snorts from the twins. Cedric grinned, then spotted Ron standing slightly shyly off to the side.

""Ron! Been practicing?""

Ron lit up at being noticed. ""Yeah, when I can! Can we play again soon?""

""I've been looking forward to it,"" said Cedric, and Ron's ears blazed bright red with pleasure. Cedric smiled at him. ""I haven't had a good match in weeks.""

None of his housemates were really into chess, and Harry had had other things on his mind. Ron beamed at him, thankfully not seeing Fred roll his eyes behind him, then further conversation was forestalled by the arrival of a redheaded hurricane.

""Ron! How many times have I told you not to run off? And you too, Ginny? I was worried sick! Oh, Fred, George, its so good to see you!""

The twins were pulled into hugs they didn't even try to escape from. Percy and Charlie had already been collected, and at Ginny's cry of delight Cedric let her down so that she could run to her other brothers. Ron, though, lingered.

""You'll come over next week, won't you?""

""Monday,"" Cedric promised. ""We'll have a game and then go flying.""

Ron gave him a brilliant smile, and Cedric couldn't help ruffling his hair. The youngest Weasley boy's lack of self-esteem reminded him horribly of Salazar sometimes. Unlike Salazar Ron didn't protest, just smiled even brighter before going to see his brothers. Cedric watched him go with a smile, then heard his name being called and turned to be enveloped in a fierce embrace.

""And Cedric, it's lovely to have you back. You've grown so much!""

""Thanks, Mrs Weasley,"" said Cedric. ""It's good to be back.""

Mrs Weasley patted him fondly on the cheek. ""And thank you for keeping an eye on these two. Merlin knows what kind of trouble they would have got into without you!""

Cedric grinned. The twins had been so busy investigating him that they had appeared almost well behaved this first term. That wouldn't last long. Fred caught his eye and snorted, quickly hiding it in a cough when Mrs Weasley glared round. ""What was that?""

""Nothing,"" said Cedric. ""There was a cold starting to go round last week.""

Fred and George grinned at him, and Mrs Weasley pursed her lips. ""Oh dear. I do hope neither of you come down with something. Pepper-Up Potions for all of you when we get home, I think.""

Her children exchanged looks, and Cedric decided it was time he excused himself. ""I should find my mum. Is it all right if I come over next week, Mrs Weasley?""

""Of course, dear! You know you never have to ask.""

""Lee's gonna visit sometime too,"" said George. ""This holiday is gonna be great!""

""Lee?"" said Mrs Weasley, and that was all she had to say before Fred and George were dragging her over to meet Lee and his dad. Cedric waved them goodbye, and Ginny ran over to hug him again.

""I saw your mum over there,"" she said, pointing in the direction of the Floo fireplaces.

""Thanks, Ginny,"" said Cedric. ""See you next week, everyone!""

He left with a chorus of farewells ringing in his ears. He weaved through the crowd, the charms he had placed on his trunk making it manageable even for him, and finally made his way over to the fireplaces.

""Mum! And Dad? I thought you had work?""

Dad laughed and caught him into a hug. ""As if I'd miss picking you up from your first term,"" he said.

Cedric grinned and hugged him tight, then shifted so that he could hug his mother too. Her hand came up to brush the back of his neck. ""It's so good to see you, bubbele.""

Cedric felt his cheeks heat up at the old endearment, but after so long away he just relaxed into her embrace. ""Its really good to see you too, Mum,"" he mumbled, into her shoulder, and felt her chuckle.

""My clever boy still needs me,"" she teased. She drew back to look at him, dark eyes studying him closely before she finally nodded. ""Hogwarts is treating you well.""

Dad clapped him on the back. ""It certainly is. He'll be as tall as me soon.""

Cedric couldn't help straightening, then blushed as his parents chuckled. Dad bent to pick up his trunk and blinked when he lifted it with no effort. ""Did you bring anything home with you?""

Cedric had meant to take the charms off before he got home, but seeing his father had distracted him. At least had learned enough from Salazar to be able to cover with a sheepish smile. ""I got one of the seventh years to charm it for me."" He grinned at them. ""Then I didn't tell Charlie and he nearly threw it across the hall when he picked it up.""

It had been a while since the older boy had looked that startled. His dad's loud guffaws drew startled looks, but Cedric was too busy soaking in his parents' presence to care. He had missed them. Mum wrapped an arm around him again.

""We'll get you home and catch up properly. I hope you didn't bring home too much washing.""

Ten minutes later found Cedric dumping his trunk in his room and bounding back downstairs. The whole house smelled like cholent, and it soothed the tension he hadn't realised he had been holding onto. Godric hadn't been particularly religious in his first life, and so growing up in a Jewish family, even one that followed Reform Judaism, had been something of a revelation. Going to Hogwarts and getting caught up in the chaos of the legacies of his life had left him neglecting the laws and traditions he followed now, and being back with his family brought home just how much he had missed it.

It wouldn't happen again, he vowed. For now, he would celebrate what left of Shabbat and be with his family and let himself be at peace.

Remus had been getting worried about Sirius. With no further information on where to start looking for Harry, and being restricted to the house thanks to his fugitive status and Moody's dire warnings about being more discreet, his friend had been growing steadily more agitated with every passing day.

Harry's second letter had only aimed that frenzied energy in another direction.

""Oh, and we have to tell him about the time Lily called out half the seventh year Ravenclaws for bullying that first year."" He sniggered at the memory. ""James was so starry-eyed he walked into a statue.""

Remus looked at the table. It was covered in half-written notes and discarded pieces of parchment. ""We're sending him a letter, not a book,"" he said. ""And I thought you were supposed to be writing a statement to give to Moody.""

The sooner the Ministry had some sort of statement about what had happened all those years ago the sooner they could get on with proving that Pettigrew had been the culprit. Moody had already found Sirius' wand somewhere in the depths of the Ministry and it was being tested, but Sirius' own account would help.

Sirius though, just glared at him.

""I don't give a damn about my innocence,"" he growled. He rummaged around in the chaos and shoved a piece of parchment against Remus' chest. ""Harry is more important.""

Remus didn't need to read the letter again. The words were burned into his brain. Harry had been understandably cautious, but one passage in particular had spoken of something deeper


Could you tell me about my parents? The Dursleys never talked about them.


Sirius' grey eyes were flashing with barely suppressed rage.

""He doesn't know anything. He doesn't know that James used to sing in the shower, or that Lily followed Muggle football from Hogwarts. He doesn't know that James asked her out fifty-seven times, or that he took her to that stupid tea shop for their first date and she hated it and he was convinced he had screwed everything up until she told him to stop being a prat and they went for ice cream instead. He doesn't know that James would do anything for his friends and Lily would never stay silent if she saw something wrong, and he has no idea how much they loved him.""

""Stop it,"" Remus whispered. His vision was blurring, and he had to take a moment to wipe away tears. Sirius suddenly paled.

""Fuck, does he even know that James was Tamil?""

Remus swallowed. Somehow he doubted that Petunia Dursley had ever bothered to think of James as anything more than that foreign boy. Vernon was no better. He had to swallow again before he could reply, ""Probably not.""

Sirius slammed a fist down on the table, sending parchment flying over the floor, but tears were gleaming in his own eyes. ""Fuck,"" he repeated. ""Fuck them, and fuck everyone who left him with them.""

Remus could feel the magic building in the room, not all of it from Sirius, and crossed the room to grip his friend's shoulder. ""We will tell him,"" he said fiercely. ""We'll teach him about his family and his heritage. We'll teach him everything James ever taught us. We will fix this.""

James had been fiercely proud of his heritage. They couldn't do anything about Harry's childhood, about how he had grown up knowing nothing about where his family came from, but they could change things now. Sirius rubbed a hand roughly across his eyes and sat up.

""You kept our notes from when James was teaching us Tamil?"" Remus nodded, and he gave a grim smile. ""That's a start. We'll work on it more when we can teach him in person.""

Remus glanced up at him. Did that mean... Sirius pulled a fresh roll of parchment towards himself. ""You come up with some more good stories, Remus. I've got a statement to write.""

Relief flooded Remus' body. He had always known Sirius would make an amazing godfather. This would be the last time Harry spent Christmas away from his family.

Then Remus sat bolt upright.

""Sirius. It's nearly Christmas.""

Sirius stilled, grey eyes going distant. ""Lily loved Christmas."" His grip tightened on the quill until Remus thought he would break it. ""He should be celebrating with us.""

""I know,"" said Remus. ""He deserves better."" Sirius frowned, and Remus let his grin appear. ""I think we can manage a bit more than just a few stories. Don't you?""

Cedric came down for breakfast refreshed and full of energy after a night spent in his own bed. He could hear his dad humming in the kitchen as he made scrambled eggs on toast, and when he poked his head into the living room he found his mother sat on the carpet surrounded by potions notes that would have turned Harry green with jealousy. It was a wonderful return to what passed for normality in their family.

Breakfast brought another surprise. Dad waited until they had finished eating before clearing his throat.

""Now, Cedric, I've got some exciting news.""

Cedric brightened. ""Did the Harpies qualify for Europe?""

""What? Oh yes, they passed with flying colours. Spectacular game actually, I've got the Prophet report somewhere-""

""Amos,"" said Mum gently. ""The other exciting news?""

Dad coughed. ""Ah, yes, of course. Thank you, dear.""

The look the two of them shared reminded Cedric far too much of how he used to look at Rowena. The resulting ache in his chest was far too familiar, and he leaned forward. ""Dad? What is it?""

Dad tore his eyes away to smile at him. ""Oh, yes. "" He puffed himself up. ""I've been promoted! You are looking at the Head of the Spirit Division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.""

""Congratulations!"" Cedric exclaimed. He stood up to give his father a hug. ""That's great!""

""Isn't it?"" said Dad proudly. ""And I already know what my first order of business will be."" He didn't wait for Cedric to voice the question. ""It's about time we found out what really happened to Professor Binns.""

Only decades of practice kept Cedric's grin on his face. ""Binns? I thought the Aurors already looked into that.""

Hogwarts had passed on the results of the investigation as soon as they made their report to Dumbledore, but neither Cedric nor Harry had been particularly worried. Harry's spell had been an old and highly effective one that left no traces. Dad frowned.

""They did, but to find no evidence whatsoever? It's a disgrace!"" He paused. ""Of course I'm sure that Rufus managed the whole affair correctly, but the Aurors don't have our specialist knowledge after all. I'm confident that we can find something they missed.""

Cedric rather doubted that, especially after two months, but he just shrugged. ""Okay, but they did say that Binns went voluntarily. Professor Bagshott is brilliant anyway.""

The young woman taught stuff that had happened in the last century for a start. Dad chuckled. ""I'm sure, but it's the principle of the thing. In fact, I was planning on having a word with Rufus at the works do.""

""Works do?""

It was Mum that answered, ""Amelia Bones is hosting this year's Ministry party. We have been invited.""

She didn't look too happy at the prospect, she liked large gatherings about as much as Harry did, but Dad was beaming at the perceived honour. ""It's about time! It'll be a fine evening."" He slung an arm around Cedric's shoulders. ""And I've told them all about you. Top of your year already! They're keen to meet you.""

Cedric nodded, then blinked. ""I'm invited?""

He couldn't imagine why anyone would want a bunch of children running around at a party, but Dad was nodding. ""It's tradition to bring children of a suitable age, or so I'm told. A chance for you to expand your horizons a bit.""

Cedric couldn't help the face he pulled. He loved meeting new people, but not like this. Dad was looking so proud though that he summoned a smile. ""Sounds like it'll be interesting.""

Dad beamed at him, and Cedric exchanged a resigned look with his mother as he was pulled into another hug. The things they did for family.

Harry stared out of the window at the stormy sky. The bad weather tugged at his magic, making him feel itchy and restless, and he tossed aside the battered cauldron he had been examining.

""No.""

Harry blinked up at his niece. ""You don't even know what I was going to say.""

Helena arched an elegant eyebrow. ""I know you, Uncle,"" she said, and her tone was scarily reminiscent of her mother. ""And I know you have more sense than to go flying in a storm.""

""I wouldn't get hurt,"" Harry muttered. Even without full control over his abilities, lightning had always been kind to him.

""No,"" Helena repeated. ""If Cedric gets back and you've flow into the Whomping Willow he'll murder me. And I've already been murdered once, and I doubt it will get any more pleasant with repeated experiences.""

Harry flinched, and she had the grace to look apologetic. ""Sorry. Force of habit.""

Harry managed a small smile. Thinking about his own murder was difficult, and he had only been aware of it for nine years. He couldn't imagine having a thousand years to dwell on it, but he could understand developing a somewhat dark sense of humour, if only to stay sane.

Instead, he focused on the less morbid part of her statement.

""What's the Whomping Willow?""

Helena waved a hand. ""I'll tell you about it in the morning. Not that I think you'd go out investigating it now...""

Harry felt his cheeks heat up and looked away. ""I promised Cedric I would stay out of trouble.""

Helena's expression spoke volumes. Harry scowled and slumped back into the sofa. ""I am, I'm just bored!""

Helena shook her head fondly. She floated down until she was closer to Harry's level. ""Remember how scared I used to be of storms?""

Harry blinked, then smiled at the memory. ""It's hard to forget. You always used to come to me.""

""You felt safe,"" said Helena softly. She met his gaze and smiled. ""You always did, but especially then.""

Harry's hand moved of its own accord before he realised he couldn't touch her. Helena reached for him at the same moment, and Harry couldn't quite suppress a hiss at the icy cold. For a moment he remembered how she used to scramble into his arms and throat her arms round his neck and it was a physical ache in his chest. Helena's own smile had turned bittersweet.

""Look how far we've come,"" she murmured.

Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. It did hurt, but he had Helena, even if it wasn't in a way either of them had ever thought possible. He looked back at his niece and smiled.

""Remember when Godric had too much of Hengist's ale and thought the thunder was a giant attacking?""

Helena snorted. ""Its hard to forget, he nearly blew the main doors off!"" She grinned. ""That was a good one. Though not as funny as the time the older students got hold of the really good stuff and threw a party.""

Harry groaned at the memory, but there was no heat in it. ""It was the first time I saw Rowena completely speechless.""

Helena laughed, bright and clear, and Harry smiled. There were worse ways to spend a holiday.

""Are you both ready to go?""

Cedric tore his gaze from the first flickering candle on the menorah and pushed himself to his feet. ""Have been for an hour,"" he called.

He tried to inject some enthusiasm into his voice, but knew he hadn't succeeded when his father sighed. ""I know this isn't how you wanted to spend the evening, Ced, but this is important to me.""

He slung an arm around Cedric's shoulders, and Cedric leaned into the embrace. ""Yeah, I know it is. I'll be more excited when I get there.""

""That's my boy."" He raised his voice. ""Naomi? Are you ready?""

""We don't have to leave for another ten minutes,"" Mum called down, and Cedric covered a smile with his hand. His mother had never been late for anything in her life. Dad sighed and brushed some fluff off of Cedric's dark blue dress robes.

""Am I being too eager?""

""Maybe just a little,"" said Cedric dryly. He glanced up at his dad. ""We are really proud of you, but you don't need to worry about impressing them. You're good at your job and that's what matters.""

Dad blinked, then smiled and patted him on the back. ""It's nice that you think so, but Ministry politics is a bit more complicated. You won't get anywhere in life if you don't play the game, my boy.""

Cedric suppressed a sigh with an effort. This was the most frustrating thing about being eleven again. Being considered mature for his age wasn't enough to get even his parents to take him seriously. About the only people older than him who didn't treat him like a little kid were Bill, Charlie, and Percy Weasley.

He closed his eyes and breathed out his annoyance. It wasn't just his dad that was the problem. The last thing he wanted to do was go to a boring party when there were so many better things he could be doing. In particular, he still hadn't been able to sneak away long enough to see Harry. He couldn't vanish for that long during the day without his mum getting suspicious, and she was good enough friends with the Weasleys and Lovegoods that he couldn't pretend to be seeing them. A party would have been the perfect opportunity.

""Ced?""

Cedric shook his head. ""Just thinking."" Maybe he would just pretend to sleep in in the morning and Apparate up to Hogwarts. It might end up taking two jumps, but he was pretty sure he could do it. He stepped away. ""I'll go and see how Mum's getting on.""

He took the stairs two at a time and nearly walked into his mum when she came out the bedroom.

""No running in the house,"" she said automatically, and Cedric gave her a sheepish smile.

""Sorry, Mum. You look great!""

She did, in traditional robes of a blue that matched Cedric's, and she straightened his outer robe with a smile. ""Thank you, and so do you."" She brushed a lock of hair back from his forehead. ""I know you don't want to do this,"" she said softly. ""But it does mean a lot to your father.""

Cedric leaned into the hug she offered. ""I know,"" he murmured. ""But I get to go flying all day tomorrow, right?""

She laughed and hugged him tight before letting him go. ""While it's light,"" she amended.

Cedric grinned. That was good enough. Mum tidied his hair one more time then sighed. ""All right, we should get going,"" she said. ""Don't worry, we won't be staying long.""

Cedric's grin widened. ""I can say I'm sick and need to go home whenever you want.""

Mum laughed and pushed him gently in the direction of the stairs. ""Come on.""

She hadn't actually said no, and Cedric was still grinning as he made his way downstairs. Dad was pacing back and forth in front of the fireplace and he brightened when he caught sight of them.

""You look lovely, darling. Now, are you both ready to go?""

""Yes, dear,"" said Mum patiently. ""As long as you're sure we won't be too early.""

""Of course not! Come on, I've already called ahead, and Madam Bones is expecting us.""

Mum quirked an eyebrow, and Cedric covered a smile with a hand. His dad was enthusiastic and passionate and that wasn't a bad thing, but he could get carried away. Dad clapped his hands. ""You first, dear?""

Mum sighed, but took a handful of Floo Powder and stepped into the flames with a grace that Cedric didn't have a chance of imitating. Dad waved him forward. ""You next, Ced. Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.""

Cedric smiled and stepped into the Floo. He still couldn't decide if it was more or less disorientating than Apparating, but at least it took less effort. He still staggered as he stepped out onto the carpet, but his mum was there to catch him and he gave her a grateful smile before straightening. The amount of magic in the house made his skin tingle, but he collected himself and turned to their hostess.

""Madam Bones. It's a pleasure to meet you.""

Madam Bones smiled down at him. ""And you. Your father has told me a great deal about you, Cedric.""

Cedric smiled, but before he could reply his father stepped smartly out of the fireplace. He straightened his robes and immediately held out a hand to Madam Bones.

""Madam Bones! Once again, thank you so much for inviting us. It really is a great honour.""

""It's a pleasure to have you, Amos,"" said Madam Bones. ""And you are right on time.""

Dad puffed himself up, but Cedric caught the glint of amusement in Madam Bones' eyes. Her long braids brushed against her robes as she turned to him. ""You are the first ones to arrive, but my niece, Susan, is upstairs.""

Cedric could take a hint, even if he would rather stay with the adults. He thanked Madam Bones, waved to his parents, and headed for the stairs. Somehow he wasn't at all surprised that they were the only ones there.

Cedric could feel the magic in the house as he made his way upstairs. The Bones were an old magical family and generations of witches and wizards had left an imprint that prickled at his skin. It seemed to get even stronger as he climbed the stairs, and without realising it Cedric quickened his pace. There was something here, something important, and he had to find out what. He moved along the corridor on silent feet until he came to the final room and opened the door.

He saw a girl around Harry's age, her yellow robes glowing against her dark skin, but all physical senses paled into insignificance next to the overwhelming rush of his magic meeting hers. Her eyes widened, at the same moment Cedric's jaw dropped.

""Helga?""

Thanks for reading! 

Also, I am not Jewish, Tamil, or Black, and while I'm trying to research as best I can I am going to make mistakes. Please do tell me when I do so that I can correct it, and any other feedback and advice would be very much appreciated.

Many thanks to TharAmira for their help with this chapter.

Cedric had spent years praying that his three dearest friends had been reincarnated alongside him. Finding Salazar in Hogwarts had given him hope, but still the fear of losing Rowena and Helga had lingered. More than one nightmare had featured a future without his two dear friends.

Now Helga was standing right in front of him and Cedric moved without thinking. He closed the gap between them in two long steps and pulled her into a fierce hug.

""Oh, Helga, I am so glad you're here.""

""Godric,"" Helga breathed, and her arms came around him in a crushing grip. ""I thought I was the only one.""

""Never,"" said Cedric. He drew back to look her in the eye, and had to swallow down a lump in his throat before he could continue. ""It is so, so good to see you again."" 

Helga beamed up at him, and her joy doubled his own. She was the warmth of the summer sun and flowers blooming in spring, and she was his little sister and he had missed her more than words could express. So much had changed; her deep brown skin and eyes were very different, and she was younger than she had been when they first met, but she was Helga and she was here and as her magic embraced him the world seemed brighter than it had in a long time. 

""I missed you,"" Helga whispered. ""I missed you so much.""

""Me too."" His face was already hurting from smiling so much, but he didn't care. ""How are you? Are you all right?""

If her life had been anything like Harry's... But Helga was already nodding. ""I'm fine. Better than fine, really. My parents and aunt... Growing up with magic has been very different."" Her smile faded slightly. ""I was just so scared that the rest of you hadn't been reborn too."" 

Cedric smiled. That was one worry he could do even more to alleviate. ""Well, I haven't found Rowena yet, but Salazar is here too.""

Helga's eyes went very wide. She turned away for a moment, and when she looked back her eyes were very bright. ""He's all right?""

Cedric pulled her into another, more gentle hug. He could understand the need to ask the question. ""As he ever is,"" he said dryly. ""He will be so glad to see you.""

Helga buried her face in his chest. ""I've missed him,"" she mumbled. ""All of you, but after we lost him...""

""I know.""

They should have had years more with Salazar. They had had another two decades with Rowena before she succumbed to illness. Salazar had been taken from them far too soon. Helga's grip tightened.

""He's not dying 'til he's at least a hundred and fifty this time.""

Cedric snorted. ""I'm glad you're here. We're going to need all the help we can get.""

Helga drew back, rubbing her eyes. ""At least it can't be any harder than last time. He doesn't have every Dark Wizard in the country after him this time.""

Cedric froze. ""Um. About that...""

Helga's eyes narrowed. ""He can't be in that much trouble. You're acting like he's Harry Potter or something.""

Cedric winced. Helga's laughter trailed off. ""Please tell me you're joking.""

Cedric shook his head. Helga sank into the nearest chair. ""Tell me everything.""

Cedric took a deep breath. He was very aware that they didn't have long before other children would be arriving, but a lot had happened in the last few months.

""Okay. Harry was sent to live with his aunt and uncle after his parents were murdered, they're massive racists and bigots so he ran away to Hogwarts last summer, I started my first year in September and met him there, he's fine, he's happy, we've been meeting up and training every day, we got rid of a terrible teacher and got a better one, we set fire to all the rubbish brooms so we could get decent ones, Harry's been exploring the Forest and there's something weird going on but it's okay I made him promise not to explore further until I got back so he can't have got into too much trouble-"" 

""Godric,"" Helga interrupted. ""Breathe!""

Cedric did, and gave her a sheepish smile. ""Right. Anyway, he's okay.""

""Good,"" said Helga quietly. She was quiet for a moment, then looked up at him. ""And how are you? Actually, who are you now?""

Cedric cast a quick glance out the door, but there were still no signs of anyone joining them. He turned back to her and stuck out his hand. ""Cedric Diggory. Nice to meet you.""

Helga shook it with a giggle. ""Susan Bones, and likewise."" She grinned at him. ""I'm a pureblood this time. It's so weird.""

""Same,"" said Cedric. ""Harry's a half-blood, I think."" He looked down, smile fading. ""I don't know about Rowena yet.""

Helga took his hand, and Cedric looked down into her dark eyes. She pulled him over to the sofa and snuggled into his side. Cedric wrapped his arm around her, relaxing automatically as he remembered all the times they had done this at Hogwarts.

""Rowena is here,"" said Helga quietly. ""And if the three of us are all around the same age then it stands to reason that she is too. She'll be at Hogwarts soon. I'm sure of it.""

Cedric pressed a kiss to her fluffy afro. ""I've missed you.""

""I've missed you too,"" said Helga. She grinned up at him. ""Though it's going to be strange calling you Cedric.""

""I still call Harry Salazar,"" Cedric admitted. ""It's fine as long as we don't do it in front of other people.""

Though he would have to make a conscious effort to start referring to her as Susan. Otherwise he would slip up, and it would probably be at the worst possible time. Susan nodded. ""Watch out for my aunt. She's really sharp.""

Cedric nodded. ""Got it."" He shook his head. ""It's hard though. A lot has changed.""

""Tell me about it,"" said Susan dryly. ""I'm a completely different ethnicity.""

Cedric grinned. ""I noticed. I'm Jewish. And Harry is Indian, we think. His aunt and uncle never answered his questions so he doesn't know for sure.""

Susan's smile faded. ""He deserved better than that."" She pulled away enough to look Cedric in the eye. ""So when are we going to visit him?""

Cedric blinked, then grinned. He didn't know why he was even surprised. ""I've actually got an idea about that."" A murmur of voices sounded from downstairs, and he frowned. ""But I don't think we have time to go into details now. I'll write to you in the morning, but trust me, it'll be fantastic.""

Susan eyed him. ""Oh? Have your plans improved in this life?""

But her eyes were sparkling again and Cedric relaxed. Footsteps sounded on the stairs and Susan detached herself with a grimace. ""If more people turn up we can sneak off,"" she whispered. ""Otherwise send an owl first thing in the morning.""

Cedric nodded, but couldn't reply before the door was flung open and two giggling girls came in. They broke off long enough to wave at Susan, who stepped forward with a smile.

""Hello! I didn't know you were coming."" She glanced at Cedric. ""Cedric Diggory, this is Alice Twycross and Marietta Edgecombe.""

Cedric summoned his best smile. ""It's a pleasure to meet you both.""

He was slightly bemused when that elicited more giggles. Cedric glanced at Susan, who just shook her, a slight smile playing about her lips. The curly-haired girl, Marietta, recovered first. ""Nice to meet you too, Cedric.""

Alice nodded, but didn't seem able to look him in the eye. Remembering his dad's words, Cedric tried again. ""Do you your parents work for the Ministry too?""

""My mum works in the Floo Department,"" said Marietta. ""So does Alice's uncle, but he knows more about Apparation. Right, Alice?""

She nudged her friend, but Alice just squeaked and continued to stare at the floor. Cedric nodded, trying to hide his confusion, but thankfully more children were arriving and Susan looped an arm through his.

""Come on, let me introduce you to people.""

""You've done this before?"" Cedric murmured. 

Susan nodded. ""Aunt Millie's been bringing me to these things for years. She says it's important to get to know people early."" She lowered her voice. ""Especially in the Ministry. She says it's much easier to predict people when you've known them as children.""

Cedric couldn't help laughing. ""I can't wait for her to meet Harry.""

""They're going to get along well,"" Susan agreed. She peered over the bannister and brightened. ""Okay, there's a lot of people down there. Come on, we'll go and hide in the guest room.""

""Why do I get the feeling you've done this before too? And what happened to introducing me to people?""

Susan arched an eyebrow at him. ""There will be plenty more Ministry parties, I can assure you. And only when I absolutely have to. Now hurry.""

Cedric cast a final glance down at the bustling hallway and followed Susan along the corridor to a closed door. Susan waved a hand at the lock, and slipped inside at the faint click. Cedric checked that no one was paying attention to them and followed her. ""This place is bigger than it looks from the outside, right?""

His dad had talked about doing it to their house, but had never got round to it. Susan nodded and dropped onto the bed. ""Yeah, it's been in the family for ages."" Her smile faded slightly. ""My other aunt and uncle used to live here, but they died during the first war.""

""I'm sorry,"" said Cedric quietly. HIs own family had come through the war mostly unscathed. Susan and Harry hadn't been so lucky, and who knew what had happened to Rowena. Susan tugged him down so she could lean against him. 

""I never met them,"" she said. ""But Dad and Aunt Millie have told me a lot about them.""

Cedric wrapped an arm around her. He didn't want to spoil the reunion with dark thoughts, but he couldn't help himself. ""We're not so sure that Voldemort is dead.""

There were a dozen better ways he could have brought that up, but the thought of facing another war was suddenly unbearable. They had just got another chance. Susan shivered. ""Some of the Aurors say the same thing,"" she said softly. ""We're going to have to do something about that.""

The steel in her voice was reassuringly familiar, and Cedric smiled. ""We will. We've got a lot of work to do.""

""Yes. And the first thing we need to do is make a plan."" She twisted to look up at him, dark eyes gleaming. ""When are we going to meet Harry?""

Cedric grinned. ""Don't worry. I've got an idea.""

Parties were exhausting, but Susan was awake before dawn the next day. Some habits took more than one lifetime to fade, and the events of the previous day, and the knowledge that she wasn't as alone as she had dreaded had left her too excited to stay in bed. She had a lot to do, and she set about getting ready for the day as quickly as she could. It would have been quicker with a wand, but the finesse with wandless magic that she had learned in her first life served her just as well in this one. That it made her parents so proud was just one more bonus.

Even after nine years, having her parents' approval sent a warm thrill through her. She had loved her first set of parents, and knew that they had loved her, but knowing that Charles and Elinor Bones loved every part of her was brought a sense of comfort she had thought lost a long time ago. 

The kettle whistled from the kitchen and Susan hurried to finish tying up her black hair. She ran down the stairs, and reached the kitchen just as her mother was pouring her first cup of tea. Mam looked up at her entrance and smiled.

""You're up early. Did you have a nice time last night?""

""I did,"" said Susan, with a smile and for once it was the truth. Seeing Cedric had been the best thing that happened to her all year. ""I made friends with Cedric.""

""Amos' son?"" Susan nodded. ""I'm glad. He seemed like a good boy.""

""He is."" She hopped onto a stool and accepted the orange juice her mother poured her with a smile. ""He's going to write and tell me about Hogwarts when he goes back.""

Mam blinked, then smiled. ""That's nice of him. And he's very good looking too.""

""Mam!""

Mam laughed, dark eyes sparkling as she sipped her tea. ""I know, I know. Studies first.""

Susan just shook her head. Cedric was the older brother she had never had and both of them were very happy with that. She refused to let herself think of the true object of her affections and leaned on the counter.

""I wish you didn't have to go in today.""

Her dad was working from home, but Christmas Eve was a time for family and it wasn't the same when one of them wasn't there. Mam smiled and cupped her cheek. ""Me too, but it's only for a half day. I just have to go over a few case details and then I'll be straight back home.""

It was the opening Susan had been hoping for, and she thought of Salazar and kept her voice light. ""Like Sirius Black's?"" 

Mam blinked. ""Well, technically he isn't one of mine, but under the circumstances..."" She shook her head, smile fading. ""Such a terrible thing to happen. Everyone has been keeping up with that one.""

""How did it happen?"" Susan asked. She needed answers, and she knew Harry would too. Despite just having woken up, Mam looked very tired.

""You have to understand, dear, things were very difficult at the end of the war. So many people were coming forward saying they had been under the Imperius Curse or otherwise coerced, others were trying to get revenge, and after everything we had lost...""

""I know,"" said Susan quietly. She had never got the chance to meet her uncle and his family. Many others had suffered even greater losses.

Mam sighed again. ""Mistakes were made. No one meant for it to happen, but it did and all we can do it try to fix it.""

Susan slipped off the stool and moved round to give her a hug. ""You will.""

It still filled her with awe that magical society had developed to the point of having a reasonably functional government, but this was a sobering reminder of how much further they still had to go. Mam hugged her tight, one hand resting on her curls. ""I hope so. Black finally sent in a personal statement, so Scrimgeour can put more pressure on the lawyers.""

Susan brightened. ""That's wonderful! Will that help them pardon him then?""

Mam thought for a moment, before slowly nodding. ""It won't hurt. It won't be long before it gets leaked to the Prophet, and Black already has a good deal of public support.""

""And Minister Fudge cares about what people think of him,"" said Susan slowly. ""He needs their support.""

Mam blinked at her. ""Yes. Yes, he does."" She ruffled Susan's hair. ""I didn't realise you paid so much attention to politics.""

Susan just shrugged. Like Cedric, she had had to get used to not being taken seriously. ""It's interesting. Sometimes,"" she amended. ""Not as interesting as your work though.""

Even if her mother's job was far more stressful. Helga had spent far too much time watching people she knew walk into danger without her. At least Aurors had had more in the way of back up than Godric and Salazar had managed with. Mam smiled, then glanced at the clock and winced.

""I'm going to be late. I'll see you later, sweetie.""

She gave Susan a quick kiss on the forehead and hurried for the fireplace. Susan sighed. She had a lot to think about, but the news about Sirius Black was promising. The sooner they could prove his innocence the sooner Harry could get an adult who wanted him. It would still take time, Sirius would need time to recover before he was fit to look after anyone, even if that someone was a reincarnated adult, but it was something. 

There was a soft tap on the window. Susan looked over to see an unfamiliar eagle owl, remembered Cedric's promise, and ran for the window. 

Harry had been hoping that Sirius and Remus would write back a little faster this time. He couldn't care less about Christmas and he wasn't expecting anything, but he really wanted to know about his parents. Helena and Edmund had told him what little they could, and there was only so much he could learn from seeing their names on trophies and class records. If Sirius and Remus were serious about wanting to be in his life he hoped that they would at least have a few stories.

He was not expecting Pinto to appear with an enormous hamper late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve. The house-elf bowed low.

""A gift, sir,"" he said, then vanished with a crack.

Helena leaned down. ""Are you going to open it, or keep gawping?""

Harry snapped his mouth shut. He set his book down and stumbled over to the delivery. ""What is all this?""

""If you hurry up and open it, we will find out.""

Harry rolled his eyes and unbuckled the strap. A heady smell of mixed sweet and savoury spices filled the room and he gasped. The Dursleys had never had anything more exotic than a curry from the takeaway found the corner. This was something else. He peered inside and blinked.

""How did they make it bigger on the inside?""

There was no way so much food should be able to fit in a hamper this size. Helena rolled her eyes. ""I'll show you the spell in the morning. Are you going to look at all this or not?""

Harry wrenched his attention from the new magic and focused on the contents. There were several boxes and wrapped packages, all smelling divine, but what caught his attention were the stack of notebooks. A thick album was tucked next to them and Harry reached for it with shaking hands. He opened it, and for the first time in his life his parents waved back.

Harry sat down hard on the floor, his vision blurring. These were his parents. His mother he had seen before in the Dursleys' old photographs, but these were so much more. Lily's vivacity blazed from every photo, and the joy in her eyes as she explored the world of magic reminded Harry so much of the young Muggleborns he used to know that he had to stop to wipe his eyes.

""She's beautiful,"" said Helena quietly. ""And she has kind eyes.""

Harry could only manage a nod. He rubbed his eyes again and focused on his father. James' skin was slightly darker than Harry's, but the thick black hair and the shape of his features were identical to his own. In most of the photos he was accompanied by his friends, or Lily, and Harry smiled at the love that poured from every image. 

How different his life would have been if they had survived.

Harry could quite happily have sat and stared at the photos for hours. There was so much he didn't know about his parents, and a quick glance through showed him that there were photos ranging from the start of their time at Hogwarts to their wedding, and even a few with Harry in, but the rest of the notebooks pulled him away. He reached for the top one, only to pause when Helena touched his arm.

""Harry. There's a letter.""

Harry grabbed it, and smiled at its thickness. He scanned the first page. ""It's full of stories about my parents,"" he whispered.

And not just that, he realised as he read further. The notebooks contained his father's scribblings about pranks, his mother's Potions and Charms theories, and everything that Remus and Sirius had been able to find about James' culture. Harry paused to find those ones, and a lump came to his throat as he found himself looking at his father's native language for the first time in his life. 

Helena, who had been reading over his shoulder, made a soft noise.

""I remember they all used to talk to each other in Tamil in their later years,"" she murmured. ""Nick always said it helped them get away with planning pranks in public.""

Harry's snort of laughter was more of a sob, but Helena didn't say anything. Another book was devoted to family recipes and descriptions of the sweets and snacks that Sirius and Remus had included, things like kozhukattai, murukku, cheedai, and pori, whose names Harry could barely pronounce but that were such an important part of his heritage that it made his chest ache.

""I never knew any of this,"" he whispered. ""How could I not know?""

If James had lived, Harry would have grown up with all of this. He would have grown up speaking Tamil and visiting India, and he would have been loved. Lily would have taught him Potions, and shown him how to love the Muggle world, not fear it. They would have been a family.

Voldemort taken that from them. Harry picked up the photo album again and turned to the very last page. His parents sat on the sofa, Harry asleep on James' chest while he and Lily held hands, and they were so young. They were twenty-one. They should have decades more, and Harry's smouldering anger crystallised into ice cold hatred. Maybe Voldemort was dead. Maybe he had already paid for the murders of Lily and James Potter.

But if he hadn't, if he did still live...

""Salazar.""

The concern in Helena's voice cut through the haze and Harry shook himself. ""Sorry,"" he muttered. He released his magic, and the wind that had been stirring died away. ""I just...Things should have been different.""

He set the notebooks back in the hamper without waiting for a response and turned back to the letter. The bunch of stories he set aside for later, but the last lines of the letter itself made him pause.


We hope you are safe, and somewhere you can enjoy the holiday. Don't hesitate for an instant if there is anything we can do you for you.



Happy Christmas, Harry



Remus and Sirius


Harry set the letter down in his lap. They hadn't asked anything else about where he was or who he was staying with, and their respect for his privacy made him feel cautiously optimistic. They had also given him far more than he had ever expected.

Maybe they had earned a little more trust.

Harry took a shaky breath. He had people who cared about him, and Sirius and Remus had given him the best Christmas present he had ever received. This holiday was rapidly turning into the best one that Harry had ever had. Not that that was a high bar admittedly, but it gave him hope. If he only had his friends, things would be perfect. 

Harry shook his head sharply. Perfect was out of his reach, but this was wonderful. He unpacked the parcels of food and laid them out on the table the Room had helpfully provided. He had no idea what anything was, but he was looking forward to finding out.

Christmas had always been Susan's favourite time of year, and so neither of her parents batted an eyelid when she retired to bed early on Christmas Eve. This time however, instead of getting ready for bed she gathered all her spare blanket and pillows and arranged them under her duvet until they formed a reasonable facsimile of a human body. Another blanket was scrunched up and placed on the pillow, and a burst of wandless Transfiguration turned it into a rough copy of her own head. It wouldn't fool anyone who came into the room, but she knew from experience that her parents wouldn't do more than glance in from the doorway to make sure she was still in bed. It would do.

There was nothing else to be done, but Susan found herself trembling. It had been so long. Nearly forty years had passed since she last saw Salazar. Forty years that they could have had together. Forty years where she had lived and Salazar had not.

Magic crackled in the air and Susan breathed it out. The glow faded from her skin, and Susan opened her eyes. The past was done. Salazar was alive and she was alive, and she would see him very soon. Her hands were still trembling, but she clenched them into fists and took a deep breath. She could do this. She focused her magic and vanished with a crack of Apparation.

Susan had been to Holgate Windmill many times, but this was the first time she had done so at night. Many of the other local landmarks would be too busy with Christmas celebrations at this time of year, but the windmill was closed and deserted, and slightly creepy if Susan was being honest with herself. She was only waiting a few minutes though before she felt a familiar prickle of magic. She flared her own magic, and a moment later a soft whisper came out of the gloom.

""Susan?""

""Here,"" Susan called back, then Cedric's pale face came into sight. He padded over to her, silent as ever on the damp grass, and took her hand.

""Any problems?""

""None,"" said Susan. ""You?""

Cedric shook his head. ""I'll never understand how Harry managed Surrey to Hogwarts in one jump. Devon to here was bad enough.""

Susan chuckled. Salazar had aways been the best of them when it came to Apparation. It was nice to know that that at least hadn't changed. ""Will you be all right to go straight to Hogwarts?""

York was closer than Devon, but it was still a good few hundred miles. Cedric though just grinned. ""It's for Harry. Of course I will."" He took her hand. ""You ready?""

Susan thought about Harry and Hogwarts and smiled. ""I've been ready for years.""

Cedric squeezed her hand, and the two of them willed themselves away. Susan felt the twisting distortion of Apparation give way to the warm embrace of magic, heard Hogwarts sing a joyful song of welcome, and then she was staring at a skinny boy with wild black hair and brilliant green eyes and fifty years worth of emotion exploded.

""Salazar!""

Harry froze in place for a long moment. His mouth opened and closed soundlessly, but Susan could feel the magic swirling around him. She took a step forward, and at the same moment Harry lurched up from the chair.

""I'm sorry,"" he whispered. ""I'm so sorry.""

Susan's vision blurred. She pulled him into a desperate hug, and felt his arms wrap around her hard enough to hurt. ""You died,"" she sobbed. ""Salazar...""

Further words were impossible. She clung to him while she wept for years lost and love left unsaid, and Harry trembled in her arms and his own tears soaked into her robes.

""I missed you,"" she managed. ""Every day.""

Harry's grip tightened. ""I missed you too. So much."" He drew back but didn't let go, and through her tears Susan saw a shaky smile touch his lips. ""But we're here now, and this time I'm not going anywhere. I promise.""

Salazar had only ever broken one promise to her and it was that one, but Susan didn't care. He was here now, and she would never let him go again. She pulled him into another hug, and relaxed further when Cedric's arms wrapped around the two of them. She had Godric and she had Salazar. This was the best Christmas she had ever had.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

It was a while before either Harry or Helga were capable of talking. Even Cedric's eyes were red from crying by the time they managed to pull themselves together. Harry felt wrung out and exhausted, but at the same time more full of hope than ever before. Helga was here. Everything was going to be all right.

Helga hadn't let go of his hand since they had reunited. Harry had no intention of changing that. They settled on the sofa, close enough that their arms and legs touched, and with Cedric on Helga's other side and Harry let himself bask in the presence of two of his dearest friends.

""I can't believe it,"" said Helga softly. ""All this time, and you've been here.""

Harry leaned into her. ""For the last six months anyway,"" he said. He looked down. ""Did...did Cedric tell you about my family?""

""They're not your family,"" said Helga, and Harry blinked at the steel in her voice. ""Family don't treat you that way."" She squeezed his hand. ""I'm sorry you had to go through that.""

Harry had to take a moment to swallow down the lump that came to his throat. ""It doesn't matter any more. I'm not going to see them ever again. I'm not going to have anything to do with them ever again.""

""Damn right,"" said Cedric softly. He reached around Helga's back to brush a hand through Harry's hair. ""And if anyone tried to make you, they'll have to go through us.""

Helga gave a slightly vicious grin. ""And my mother and aunt. Law enforcement takes a very dim view on child abuse.""

Harry made a soft noise of protest, and Helga frowned at him. ""It's true. You wouldn't call it anything else if it had happened to someone else.""

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. That was fair enough. He forced himself to let it go, then frowned. ""Your family are in law enforcement?""

""That's right. Mam's an Auror, and my Aunt Millie is the Head of the DMLE.""

It took a moment for Harry to place the name, and then he could only stare at her. ""Your aunt is Amelia Bones?""

""Yep,"" said Helga cheerfully. ""I'm Susan."" Her smile faded as she looked at him. ""So if I asked if you were all right would you give me an honest answer? Knowing that I could do something about it?""

Once again, Harry found himself lost for words. Susan met his gaze steadily, and her honest love and compassion left Harry breathless. He had missed her. He had missed her so much. He leaned into her, and took a deep breath.

""I'm better,"" he said. ""I'm safe here. I have Hogwarts, and the elves, and you. I-I just really don't want to go back to them.""

""Then you won't,"" said Susan, and though her voice was mild the steel in it was unmistakeable. Cedric hummed agreement, and Susan continued, ""I know no one can find you if you don't want them to, but if anything does happen then I'll talk to my family.""

Harry let out a long breath. ""Thank you.""

If he trusted anyone to keep him safe, it was the people in this room. Susan relaxed a little, and turned a warm smile on him. ""And hopefully it won't be too long before you have something more permanent anyway.""

Harry's heart leapt. Did that mean... 

Susan squeezed his hand. ""Mam says Sirius Black sent in a statement,"" she said. ""Scrimgeour has been putting pressure on the Minister. The public are getting more and more interested. Soon they'll be calling for a review of the case, and then everything will come out.""

""And they'll realise that Sirius is innocent,"" Cedric breathed. He bounced to his feet and started pacing. ""This is fantastic! With Harry's godfather a free man and willing to take him in, and Harry making his preferences known, they can't send him back to the Dursleys!""

Susan nodded, dark eyes shining, but Harry hesitated. He couldn't let himself hope. Not yet. ""He might not be able to take me in,"" he said slowly. ""He's been in Azkaban for years. He might not be ready for the responsibility.""

""Perhaps not,"" said Cedric. ""But we know how much he cares about you; we've seen his letters. He has Lupin too, and I know that they'll do whatever it takes to make sure that he's the guardian you deserve.""

He paused and crouched in front of Harry. ""They want you, Harry. They care about you. And I think you'll be happy with them."" His eyes softened. ""You deserve that, Harry.""

Harry drew in a shaky breath. He wanted to believe them. He wanted to trust Sirius and Remus. But trust had never come easily, and with his position so vulnerable he couldn't take risks. 

But...

Harry's eyes found the hamper they had sent, with all the letters and journals and more links to his family than he could ever have dreamed of. Sirius and Remus were trying. They hadn't let him down yet. He took a deep breath, and nodded.

""Maybe,"" he said quietly. ""I... We've still got time. I'll keep writing. I...I think they will too.""

Susan leaned into him, and Cedric nodded approvingly. He followed Harry's gaze. ""It looks like they're doing more than that. What's all this?""

Harry had to swallow down a lump before he could reply. ""They wanted me to know more about my parents. About my heritage."" He hesitated, but Susan's grip on his hand and Cedric's steady gaze leant strength. ""My father was Indian. Tamil.""

Cedric's face broke into a brilliant smile, but Susan was frowning. ""You didn't know before?""

Harry looked away. ""I knew I didn't look like anyone else in Little Whinging,"" he said, and he couldn't quite keep the bitterness from his voice. ""Petunia never told me anything.""

Susan squeezed his hand. ""I'm sorry you had to go through that."" Her smile was decidedly forced. ""I'm the only Black person in my primary school.""

Harry grimaced. It wasn't a feeling he would wish on anyone. He wrapped an arm round her, and Susan leaned gratefully into his support. Cedric's smile faded and he sat down by Susan again. ""I'm sorry,"" he said softly.

Susan shook her head. Her fluffy hair brushed against Harry's cheek as she turned to look up at him. ""I heard one of my great-uncles talking about the Potters. He was at Hogwarts when your grandfather moved back from India. Apparently their return caused quite the stir.""

Harry nodded, willingly seizing on the change of subject. He had only skimmed the journals detailing the Potter family history, but he could imagine that the return of an old pureblood family would have been noticed. Cedric snorted. 

""That must have been quite the dilemma for them. Old pureblood family with an excellent reputation, but Indian?""

His imitation of a pompous pureblood was perfect, and Harry had to laugh. Susan did too, but she sobered quickly. ""Especially a family with money."" She glanced at Harry. ""You do know your family had money, don't you?""

""I'd gathered as much,"" said Harry, with a nod. ""I haven't been able to access any of it yet. It's not a priority,"" he added, when both his friends frowned. ""I have everything I need here, even a wand. Which reminds me; Susan, you should see if there's one that works for you.""

Susan's eyebrows shot up. ""Who loses a wand?""

""That's exactly what we said,"" said Cedric dryly. He held up his two wands. ""I'm not complaining though.""

Susan shook her head, but didn't argue. Harry summoned the rest of the wands, and watched her look through them. She spent longer on the job than Cedric had; taking the time to examine the workmanship of each of the wands, and letting them speak to her magic. She had always had a better grasp of wandlore than he or Cedric had. Sparks danced along her dark skin as she waved one of the wands, and warmth spread through Harry's body. He was so glad she was back.

A nudge broke him from his thoughts, and Harry looked up to find Cedric watching him. His friend leaned in to him.

""I hope you're not going to waste this chance.""

Harry didn't bother denying it. He shook his head, and Cedric smiled. ""Good.""

His expression turned wistful as he looked back at Susan, and it was Harry's turn to nudge him. ""We will find Rowena.""

Cedric flinched. Harry sighed. ""We're here. She must be too.""

Nothing else made sense. Cedric gave him a small smile, then brightened as a shower of sparks burst from Susan's wand. ""What was that?""

Susan glanced back at them, a brilliant smile on her face. ""Pear wood,"" she said. ""And unicorn hair, I think."" She flicked the wand, and the mess on the table vanished. ""It's not perfect, but it will do.""

""It suits you,"" said Harry quietly. He recalled what little he'd managed to pick up of wandlore. ""A wand suited for the wise, generous, and  pure of heart.""

Susan gave him a shy smile as she stowed the wand away in her robes. ""You've been studying.""

Harry shrugged. ""I need to keep busy while Cedric's in classes, and there's only so much cleaning one can do in a day.""

Susan pulled a face in sympathy, but then brightened. ""Fortunately, my schedule is rather lighter.""

Harry's heart leapt. Cedric grinned. ""You sure you won't be missed?""

""I will be careful,"" said Susan, with a nod. ""I did learn plenty from the two of you, and my family trust me.""

As much as the thought of Susan visiting regularly filled Harry with dizzying delight, Harry found himself hesitating. They were only nine, and Apparating so far on a regular basis would take its toll. Eventually someone would notice.

""That's a long way,"" he said. ""I'm not saying don't,"" he added quickly, when Susan's jaw set in the way he was very familiar with, ""but we should think of some other way to communicate. It would help when you're away too,"" he said, glancing at Cedric.

Susan paused. ""That would be a good idea,"" she admitted. ""Something like our rings, perhaps?"" She grimaced. ""Though we were never were able to work out how to communicate in full sentences.""

""It's something we can work on,"" said Cedric. ""After all, we do have time on our hands. Classes aren't exactly taxing at the moment.""

Harry snorted. Susan grinned. ""My tutors think I'm a genius,"" she said. ""I can't really tell them that I'm over a hundred.""

Harry stared. He had had no idea that she had lived so long in her first life. Cedric rubbed the back of his neck. ""Yeah, I had the same thing. My teachers don't mind if I read ahead though, and Sprout mentioned finding more to do if I handled all that.""

Harry kept quiet. He didn't think it would help to mention that the Dursleys had paid no attention to his lessons, no matter what his teachers said. From the look his friends gave him they could guess the truth anyway, but both had the tact not to mention it. He rubbed the back of his neck, then his eyes fell on the hamper.

""I could ask Sirius and Remus,"" he said slowly. ""They mentioned that they and their friends were quite creative. They might have some ideas.""

""Good idea,"" said Cedric immediately. He patted Harry on the head. ""They'll appreciate you reaching out too.""

Harry ducked away with a scowl, but didn't bother trying to flatten his hair. Susan was openly grinning, and Harry let himself drink in the sight. He had missed her so much. Cedric looked between the two of them, his grey eyes fairly glowing with delight, then glanced at his watch.

""Look, I'd really love to stay, but I should get back home. Mum doesn't usually sleep through the night, and I don't want her to realise I'm gone."" He slung an arm around Harry's shoulders. ""But I'll be back before the holidays are over.""

Harry leaned into the comfort. ""Thank you.""

The words encompassed so much more than just that promise, and Cedric squeezed him tight in acknowledgement. He waved Susan over, and pulled her into the hug too. ""And I won't be forgetting you. Dad's delighted that we made friends, so I've got an excuse to write, and I bet I can work that into an invitation before the week is out.""

Susan laughed. ""I'm not taking that bet. Mam and Dad won't take much convincing, they want me to make more friends."" Her dark eyes sparkled as she looked at Harry. ""I don't think they were expecting Harry Potter though.""

Harry grinned. Cedric chuckled, and gave them both one final hug before reluctantly disentangling himself. ""I'll see you both soon. Harry, stay out of trouble.""

""Why aren't you telling Susan to stay out of trouble?"" Harry protested.

""Because I don't need to,"" Cedric pointed out.

Susan folded her arms. ""I could get into trouble if I wanted to. Have you seen how many new species of dragon they've discovered in the last thousand years?""

Cedric burst out laughing. ""Remind me to introduce you to Charlie Weasley,"" he said. ""He's mad about dragons. He's planning to go and work on one of the reserves when he finishes Hogwarts.""

Susan's eyes went very wide. Harry shook his head. Nearly being eaten by one dragon was quite enough for two lifetimes. Still smiling, Cedric clapped him on the back, and ruffled Susan's hair. ""Have fun you two!""

With that, he turned on his heel and Disapparated with a dull crack. Susan sighed and sat back on the couch.

""I've really missed this.""

Harry smiled at her. ""Me too.""

Susan's smile softened. Harry's heart lurched as he looked at her. Their eyes met, and Harry shifted his weight.

""Helga-""

""Salazar-""

They broke off at the same time. Harry felt his cheeks heat up, and Susan gave an awkward giggle. ""Sorry.""

""Me too,"" Harry mumbled.

There was an awkward pause as they looked at one another. Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again, and instead sat down on the edge of the sofa. This time he sat so that he could look at Susan, and she shifted too, pulling up her legs so she could curl up. 

Harry swallowed. There was so much he wanted to say. There was so much he needed to tell her, so much he never got a chance to tell her in their last lifetime. He couldn't let that again. Helga deserved better than that.

Salazar had been renowned for his silver tongue, but when it came to this? He didn't even know where to start.

But this was Helga. She deserved better. For her, he had to try.

""Salazar.""

Harry blinked up. Susan was still watching him. Her deep brown eyes, so different to the blue of her first life and yet filled with the same warmth and compassion, met his, and Harry's fear drained away. This was Helga. He trusted her with everything he was. There was nothing he couldn't say to her.

""Yes?""

""Are you...Is everything all right?""

Harry took a breath, and let it out very slowly. ""I...Yes. But there's something I need to tell you.""

He held out his hand, and was relieved when Susan took it without hesitation. She squeezed his fingers gently. ""You can tell me anything, Salazar,"" she said softly. ""Anything.""

Harry's throat was bone dry. His heart hammered against his ribcage as he swallowed, but Susan's eyes and grip were grounding and Harry drew on all the courage Godric had taught him.

""I... Before. I meant to tell you, but I never got the chance."" He paused, and had to swallow hard. ""I like to think I would have told you, if I'd had more time.""

""It's all right, Salazar. Tell me now.""

Blood was pounding in Harry's ears, but all that mattered was Susan. ""I couldn't say it before, but, I love you.""

Susan's eyes went very wide. Harry couldn't look away. ""I love you,"" he repeated. ""For so long, but I didn't know... I didn't think...""

He trailed off, unable to finish the sentence, but Susan's grip tightened on his fingers as understanding filled her face. ""Oh, Salazar,"" she breathed. She reached forward to cup his cheek. ""I love you too.""

Warmth exploded in Harry's chest. Susan blurred in front of him, and he heard her choke out a sob before she pulled him into a crushing hug. ""I loved you for so long,"" she whispered. ""I thought...I thought you considered me a friend. A dear one, but...""

""I thought I did too,"" Harry whispered. It was easier to speak like this, when he could just hold her. ""I had never loved anyone like that before. By the time I realised what I felt was different...""

Susan made a soft noise of understanding. ""By that time I thought friendship was all you wanted."" A watery chuckle escaped her. ""And to think we used to laugh at Godric and Rowena.""

Harry snorted. Reluctantly he pulled back, and rubbed his eyes enough to focus on her. She smiled back at her, her own face as tearstained as his, and Harry let out a shaky breath. ""I love you,"" he said. ""I think I always will.""

This time Susan was the one to hold out her hand, and Harry took it immediately. She was silent for a moment, but when she looked up her smile took Harry's breath away. ""I've loved you for a hundred years. I don't think anything is going to change.""

Harry couldn't speak. He had spent decades thinking he would never hear those words. He had never believed himself worthy of it, but Susan, Susan did, and he trusted her judgement more than anyone he had ever met. He smiled at her, heart overflowing with joy, and Susan's answering smile was so bright that it took his breath away.

They had wasted so much time in their first life.

Harry shook himself out of the memories and regrets. They had been given a second chance. They wouldn't make the same mistakes again. Susan let out a long breath, and when Harry looked back her smile had faded. Harry squeezed her hand.

""Helga?""

Susan hesitated a moment, then sighed. ""I do love you,"" she whispered. ""And that is why I need to ask you something.""

""What?""

Susan looked back, and Harry's heart clenched at the pain in her face. ""Please be careful,"" she said. ""I can't... You died, Salazar.""

Harry swallowed. He'd been avoiding thinking about his own death, and trying even harder to avoid the effect it must have had on his friends. Susan's hands were shaking.

""You died alone, and we were left behind. I don't...I can't do that again, Salazar.""

A lump filled Harry's throat. He had to swallow hard before he could reply, ""I'm sorry. I never wanted to leave you."" He took a deep breath, and sat up straight. ""I promise that I will be careful.""

That was as much as he could do. He might not be a Dark wizard hunter in this life, but he was the Boy Who Lived. Even if Voldemort wasn't dead, there were still plenty of his followers around. Harry was used to being a target, but the expression on Susan's face made him pause. 

He had never been good at looking after himself, but he had never wanted to hurt her.

""I'll try,"" he promised.

Susan let out a long shaky breath. ""Thank you."" She gave him a small smile. ""I know you won't stop fighting, and I would never ask you to, but you don't have to do it alone.""

""I know,"" said Harry quietly. ""I'm working on it,"" he amended, when Susan quirked an eyebrow at him. ""I don't want...I'd like to avoid that end this time.""

Susan flinched at the thought. Harry swallowed, and shifted so that he could wrap an arm around her. ""Sorry.""

""So am I,"" Susan whispered. ""You deserved so much better than that.""

For a long minute they sat in silence. Harry felt the memories of his ambush at death burning at the edges of his mind, and forced himself to focus on Susan. Susan was here, she was safe, and she loved him. It was more than he had ever thought possible.

Susan stirred in his arms.

""This time will be better.""

Her voice was quiet in it, but it held the same core of steel it had had when she voiced her desire to build a school for all magical children. Harry drew on that strength, and nodded.

""It will. We will make it better.""

Susan twisted to smile up at him. ""All we need now is Rowena.""

""We will find her,"" said Harry. ""She has to be here somewhere.""

She had to be, and she had to be around their age. It was the only thing that made sense. She would come to Hogwarts soon. Susan nodded, but there was a gleam in her eye that made Harry pause.

""What are you thinking?""

Susan straightened. ""There are three of us here now. Three of us, and Hogwarts. I think we can do more than just wait for her to come to us.""

A fission of excitement raced through Harry's body. Susan leaned forward, her dark eyes burning into his. ""I think we can find her, Harry.""

Harry let out a long breath. He didn't know if they could do that. He had no idea where they would even start. There was no telling if it was even possible.

People had said the same things about a school for magical children.

Harry looked back at Susan and smiled.

""We do have time to work on it.""

Susan's answering smile lit up the room. Harry closed his eyes and basked in the sense of rightness. Helga was back. She loved him. Anything was possible now.

Apologies for the delay in updating, working in the NHS during a pandemic has not been fun. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you liked this chapter.

Cedric waited with bated breathing for his mum to make her decision. Her face was very stern as she paced up and down, but when she looked back there was a familiar twinkle in her dark eyes.

""You won't go too high? Or too fast?""

""No,"" said Cedric. ""I'll be careful, promise.""

Mum's lips twitched, and she nodded. ""All right, but I expect you back in time for tea.""

Cedric beamed, and bounced to his feet. ""Thank you!""

His mother's laughter followed him as he raced through to the back of the house. The old, but well looked after Silver Arrow his grandfather had given him hung from its hook, and Cedric felt it shiver in its hands as he lifted it down.

""I know,"" he told it. ""It's been much too long.""

The new brooms at Hogwarts were great, but there was something special about his own broom. His parents had looked after it well while he was gone, but Cedric still checked it over carefully. A lifetime of fighting had taught him caution, and it was a good habit to get into besides.

By the time he was happy, his mum had packed him an appropriate selection of sweets, and a note for Mrs Weasley. Cedric settled his rucksack on his back, kissed her on the cheek, and shot off into the sky.

Cedric loved flying, in any weather and for any reason, but being on his way to spend a day with his friends on a clear winter morning was something special. He hadn't seen any of the Weasleys since they had broken up for the holidays, and while it had been good to be able to concentrate on Harry and Susan he had missed the Weasleys too.

It wasn't far to the Burrow, especially by air, but Cedric's hands were soon numb with cold. A Wandless Warming Charm helped though, and the beauty of his surroundings more than made up for it. He couldn't wait to show this to Harry and Rowena one day. They might even be able to coax Susan onto a broom. He smiled at the thought, and it widened when the Burrow came into view.

Someone must have spotted him, or his mum had called ahead, for red-heads were pouring out into the garden as Cedric started his descent. He landed in the garden, and barely had time to get his balance before Fred was thumping him on the back.

""How'd you get your mum to let you fly here?""

""I'm trustworthy,"" said Cedric with a grin, and laughed when the twins gave identical explosive snorts.

""Jammy git,"" said George. ""Mum won't let us fly in the orchard without Charlie there.""

""Yeah, 'cause she knows you,"" Charlie pointed out. He reached over Ron's head to shake Cedric's hand. ""It's good to see you, Cedric.""

Cedric smiled at him. Charlie was a sixth year now, and Quidditch Captain, and one of the most popular students at Hogwarts, but he hadn't changed at all. ""You too. How's the studying going?""

Charlie pulled a face. ""Nope. We're not talking about school on my day off from revising."" He squinted up at the clear sky. ""I know you just only just got here, but I don't know how long this weather's going to last, so if we want to get a game in...""

""Sounds good,"" said Cedric quickly. ""Give me a minute though, I need to say hello to your mum."" He glanced round and frowned. ""I'm guessing Percy's upstairs, but where's Ginny?""

She normally would have jumped on him by now. Charlie chuckled. ""She went over to see Luna. She'll be sorry she missed you.

Cedric smiled. ""I'll visit again before we go back to school."" He turned towards the house, and spotted Ron hovering at the edge of the group. ""Hi Ron. You ready for Quidditch?""

Behind him Fred sighed, but Ron lit up. ""Yeah! I've been practicing really hard!"" He bounced on his toes. ""And Percy got a new chess set for Christmas so I got his old pieces.""

""We'll have a game later,"" said Cedric, with a nod. 

Ron beamed at him, and Cedric stamped on Fred's foot without looking at him. Fred grumbled under his breath, but Cedric left George to handle him and slipped his rucksack off his shoulders. ""I'll be back in a minute.""

Mrs Weasley was bustling around the kitchen and Cedric smelled scones in the oven before he even opened the door. Tension he hadn't realised he'd been holding drained out of his shoulders. The Burrow had practically been a second home for the last eleven years, and he had spent a lot of time in this kitchen.

Harry would love it. He had never had a big family. Cedric pushed that thought firmly to the back of his mind, and pulled open the door.

""Good morning, Mrs Weasley.""

He was promptly engulfed in a floury hug. ""Hello, dear. I hope the flight over wasn't too cold."" She pulled back and gave him an appraising look. ""At least you had the sense to wear gloves.""

Cedric smiled. ""Mum wouldn't let me leave without them. Oh, and she made these for us.""

He handed over the bag of sufganiyot, and Mrs Weasley beamed at him. ""How wonderful, thank you. I'll send you back with some of these scones you like.""

""Cedric, come on!""

Cedric winced at the yell from the garden, but Mrs Weasley's eyes sparkled. ""You run along and play now, dear.""

He should have bristled at being talked to like that, but it was hard to get annoyed with Molly Weasley. Besides, he did want to play Quidditch. Cedric grinned at her, and dashed back out into the snow.

""I'm here,"" he called. ""What are the teams?""

""Cedric's with me!""

Cedric swallowed a laugh with an effort as the twins glared at each other. Fred's eyes narrowed. ""I said it first.""

George glared back. ""We said it at the same time,"" he growled. ""And he was on your team last time.""

""Was not. You're thinking of the time last summer-""

""Don't be stupid, you know what I'm talking about-""

""You're the stupid one if you can't remember that-""

""Stop that,"" Charlie snapped. The twins switched their glares to him, but Charlie just folded his arms and scowled back. ""We'll swap the teams around after each match. Cedric, you'll be with me first.""

""Sounds good,"" Cedric agreed.

Fred and George looked momentarily crestfallen, before exchanging identical grins. ""Fine,"" said Fred. ""But don't complain when we win.""

""I can promise you that we won't,"" said Cedric solemnly, but even as he said it he found his eyes drifting to Ron. The younger boy was watching them with wide eyes, but the slump of his shoulders betrayed his resignation. He sighed and started to turn back towards the house, and Cedric's heart clenched.

""Are you going to play, Ron?""

Fred frowned, but Ron looked like Christmas had come round again. ""Really? I can play?""

He turned to Charlie, and Cedric saw his resistance evaporate under that hopeful stare. Charlie chuckled and ruffled his brother's hair. ""Why not? The more the merrier."" He cocked his head to one side. ""It makes the teams uneven, but we'll cope.""

""Because having the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain on one of them didn't make it uneven at all,"" said Cedric pointedly.

Ron hastily turned a snort into a cough. The twins didn't bother hiding their cackles, but Cedric kept his most innocent expression in place as Charlie peered at him. ""Are you sure you're a Hufflepuff?""

""I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be,"" said Cedric firmly.

Charlie looked at him, his gaze turning appraising. ""Yes,"" he said. ""I think you are."" He flashed a sudden blinding grin, and chucked the Quaffle to Ron. ""Come on then. Let's get moving before the rain hits.""

Cedric grinned and grabbed his broom. It was going to be a good day.

Alastor was not having a good day.

For a start, he hated winter. The cold made his stump ache and the remains of his nose throb, and snow and ice were a pain in the arse to navigate. Add to that all the idiots that came out around the holidays, and Alastor was ready to sleep until spring.

If he was having a bad day though, Scrimgeour's was going even worse.

""How did they get hold of it?""

Alastor shrugged. The Ministry was as leaky as a sieve, and the Auror Department was no exception. Scrimgeour glared down at the front of the Prophet, where Sirius Black's personal statement was printed in full in their most impressive font, and slumped back into the chair.

""The mail room is already full of letters of protest,"" he said. ""The public were angry enough about the lack of a trial, and now this...""

He trailed off with a scowl. Alastor grimaced. ""Black always did have a way with words.""

He had heard enough from Minerva to know that, but even he had been surprised by just how eloquent the statement was. Persuasive was an understatement. Scrimgeour gave a thin smile.

""It's probably a good thing,"" he said. ""Fudge was already bowing under the weight of public opinion. I won't be surprised if he skips the trial altogether and goes straight for the pardon.""

Alastor bit back a comment with an effort, Scrimgeour was well aware of his opinions on Fudge, and focused on the matter at hand. ""Wouldn't be such a bad thing. He's been on the run long enough.""

Scrimgeous grunted. His hand dropped to massage his bad knee as he squinted up at Alastor. ""Still no luck tracking him down?""

Anyone who didn't know him as well as Alastor did would have missed the amusement in his eyes. Alastor just shrugged again. ""He's good, but I have some ideas.""

Scrimgeour sat back in his chair. ""Maybe you should go and follow them up.""

Alastor smirked at him. ""Try a heating charm on that knee,"" he said. ""Works wonders."" He pushed himself off from the wall and stomped towards the door. ""Don't murder Fudge before I get back.""

Scrimgeour's snort of laughter followed him from the room, and Alastor smirked as he left the department and headed for the atrium. Being an Auror was a tough job, but at least his boss wasn't one of his problems.

The usual horde of vultures were waiting in the atrium, but not even Skeeter tried to ask him for a comment. Alastor favoured them with a smile that made a couple of the younger ones blanche, then turned on his heel and Disapparated. 

There was even more snow in Birmingham than there was in London. Alastor swore under his breath as he made his way through to Lupin's inconspicuous little terraced house. His mood improved slightly when he faint the faint crackle of static that indicated they'd finally put up some sort of protections, but when he thumped on the door there was no reply.

""Lupin,"" he barked. ""Open up.""

He knocked again, harder this time, and finally the door swung open to reveal a harried-looking Lupin. Alastor spared a moment to be grateful that Black had finally learned to stay out of sight before scowling. 

""What kept you?""

""Sorry,"" said Lupin. ""We were upstairs.""

He closed the door and hurried back up without another word. Alastor sighed and followed.

The house looked like a whirlwind had gone through it. Old books and papers were scattered everywhere, and Alastor spotted old toys and joke shop products underneath the dust. Black stood in the centre of the chaos going through yet another trunk, and he didn't look up as they entered.

""They're not here either!""

Lupin sighed. ""I told you I haven't seen them in years."" He picked up a battered Snitch, expression turning nostalgic. ""I'd forgotten I'd kept this.""

""Focus, Moony,"" Black snapped. ""Where else could they be?""

""What the hell is going on here?"" Alastor demanded.

Black spun round, wand appearing in his hand, only to trip on a sheaf of papers and hit the ground with a crash. Alastor rolled his eyes. ""Your situational awareness is dreadful.""

Black scrambled to his feet and stuffed his wand back into his jeans. ""Yeah, yeah, whatever. What do you want, Moody?""

""I asked first.""

Lupin stepped between them before an argument could ensue. ""We heard from Harry again.""

""What? What did he say?""

Lupin smiled, and it made him look a decade younger. ""He liked our Christmas present. I think he might be starting to trust us.""

Alastor gave a non-committal grunt, and Black huffed. ""He's not going to trust us if we can't help him now. Why did you go and lose them for?""

""I didn't do it on purpose,"" said Lupin, rolling his eyes. ""It's not a disaster, we can make new ones easily enough-""

""That'll take time, and Harry wants them now!"" 

""What does he want?"" Alastor asked.

Lupin sighed. ""He asked if we knew of a way to communicate face to face."" He looked at Black, and when Black shrugged he continued, ""When we were at school we had these mirrors. They were paired, so if you spoke into one the other person could hear you.""

""We used to use them in detention,"" said Black. For a moment his expression was wistful, before the manic energy returned. ""Now Harry needs them and we can't bloody find them!""

Alastor had to take a moment to pull his mind back from the multitude of ways that that sort of communication could be helpful before he could reply. ""How long would it take to make new ones?""

Black waved a hand. ""A few days, once we get the base materials, but that's too slow!""

""Sirius,"" said Lupin with a sigh, ""Harry doesn't need them straight away. He asked if we had ideas, not if we could provide him with an instant solution.""

""I don't care! It's been years, Remus! I want to see my godson!"" He paused, eyes gleaming. ""I know where mine are.""

Lupin frowned, then his eyes widened and he shook his head. ""You cannot break into Grimmauld Place!""

""Why not?""

""You were disowned, Sirius! If your mother sees you-""

""I'm not afraid of her,"" Black spat. ""Or Kreacher, or anything else in that hellhole.""

""Hold on,"" Alastor interrupted. ""Black, have you forgotten that you're a fugitive?""

""I don't-""

""And that your house is under surveillance?""

""So?"" Black demanded. ""I can dodge them easily enough. I broke out of Azkaban, didn't I?""

Lupin let his head fall against the wall. Alastor took a deep breath and fixed Black with his fiercest glare. ""You're an idiot.""

Black flushed, but Alastor didn't give him a chance to interrupt, ""You're going to get yourself captured or killed, and for what? A couple of mirrors that you can reproduce in a couple of days anyway?""

""For Harry,"" Black snarled. ""For all the times I let him down before.""

""Getting yourself hurt is not going to help Harry,"" Alastor insisted. ""You know that."" He took a step closer. ""You're burning up with the need to do something, but you're not thinking. Harry needs you alive and free, not in prison, and definitely not caught up with your damned family.""

""But I have to do something!"" Black exploded. He turned on his heel and started pacing, eyes flashing and voice rising higher and higher. ""I abandoned him! He was stuck with those people for years, and he hated so much that he ran away to Merlin knows where, and I wasn't there!""

""Sirius,"" Lupin began, but Black silenced him with a look.

""I failed him,"" he rasped, and the quiet devastation was worse than the screaming. ""I failed him for so long. I can't...I won't fail him again.""

Alastor's chest ached. None of this should have happened. Harry and Black both deserved so much better. He shifted, at a loss for how to help, and it was Lupin who stepped forward. He rested a hand on Black's shoulder, and when Black didn't react he gripped both arms hard.

""You won't,"" he said fiercely. ""Neither of us will. But we can't keep rushing into things, Sirius. We have to think about Harry first.""

The two of them stared at each other for a long minute. Alastor watched patiently, until finally Black sagged as if his strings had been cut. Lupin caught him into a fierce hug.

""I know,"" he said. ""We'll find him. We won't let him down again.""

Alastor gave them a minute before clearing his throat. ""What do you need to make these mirrors?""

Black gaped at him, then a brilliant smile spread across his face. For a moment he looked like the young man who had fought alongside them, then he moved forward to grip Alastor's hand.

""Thank you.""

Alastor coughed. ""All right,"" he said gruffly. ""Least I could do.""

Both of them were looking at him in a way that made him very uncomfortable, and he cast about for a change of subject. The copy of the most recent Daily Prophet lying in the corner was as good as any.

""Your statement made an impact.""

Lupin followed his gaze and shook his head. ""It's the first time I've been glad that the Ministry is so unreliable,"" he said dryly.

Black snorted, and Alastor nodded. ""Press is having a field day. Wouldn't be surprised if the Minister takes action soon.""

""Good,"" said Black. His grey eyes glittered as they met Alastor's. ""I've got work to do.""

""Check.""

Cedric stared at the chessboard, then at Ron. ""Huh,"" he managed. ""I didn't see that one coming.""

Ron's ears blazed red as he gave a shy smile. ""Percy found a book on chess in the library and brought it home for me. It was interesting.""

""I can see you've learned a lot,"" said Cedric. The game wasn't unsalvageable, but it was going to be a bit more tricky than he was expecting. He moved his king out of danger, and winced when it cost him his remaining bishop. ""That was a good move.""

""Thanks,"" Ron mumbled.

His ears were still as red as his hair. Cedric grinned, suddenly even more glad than ever that he'd made the time for a game before heading home. The Weasleys were some of his favourite people, but Ron was unassuming enough that it was easy for him to fall through the cracks. Seeng him so happy was worth getting home a bit late.

Cedric did end up winning the game, but it was the closest he had come to losing in a long time. Ron pulled a face as he carefully packed his pieces away. 

""I'll beat you next time,"" he vowed. ""I'm going to ask Percy to look for more books when he goes back to Hogwarts.""

""That's a good idea,"" said Cedric. He thought for a moment. ""It might be worth checking the Muggle library in town too. Muggles play chess too, after all."" 

""I hadn't thought of that. Thanks!""

""No problem."" He ruffled Ron's hair, and grinned when he ducked away the same way Harry did. ""Maybe you should look into competitions. You'd definitely stand a chance.""

Ron ducked his head in a futile attempt to hide an even brighter blush. ""Maybe,"" he mumbled. 

He opened his mouth, then paused and closed it again. Cedric cocked his head to one side. Ron was as competitive as Charlie and the twins, and he would normally leap at a chance to prove himself, but his eyes were fixed on the chess pieces. Cedric chewed on his lip for a moment, but he couldn't leave that alone.

""What's wrong?""

""Nothing,"" Ron squeaked.

It would be more convincing if he managed to meet Cedric's gaze. Cedric leaned forward. ""Come on, Ron. You can talk to me.""

Ron nodded. He took a deep breath and looked up. ""I just... Can I ask you something?""

""Of course,"" said Cedric. ""You can ask me anything, you know that."" He gripped Ron's shoulder. ""What's on your mind?""

Ron hesitated a moment longer, then took another breath. ""When you were sorted into Hufflepuff, was it because you wanted to, or because your parents were there?""

Cedric blinked at him. Whatever he had been expecting, that wasn't it. Ron shifted in his seat. ""Never mind,"" he muttered. ""It doesn't matter.""

He started to push himself upright, and Cedric hurried to catch his arm. ""I don't mind,"" he said. ""I just hadn't thought about it.""

Ron sat back with a small smile. Cedric considered his answer for a minute, then nodded to himself. He couldn't tell the whole truth, but Ron wouldn't ask for no reason and he deserved a proper answer. ""A bit of both, I guess,"" he said finally. ""I knew it would make my parents happy, but I wouldn't have gone there if I would have fitted in better somewhere else.""

Ron nodded slowly. Cedric studied him. ""Can I ask why you were thinking about it?""

Ron shrugged. His eyes dropped to the king he was rolling around in his fingers, but Cedric waited and after a minute Ron's shoulders slumped. ""I thought you'd be in Gryffindor.""

Cedric had to smile. ""I thought about it,"" he admitted. ""But I like Hufflepuff as much as I would have liked Gryffindor.""

Ron frowned slightly, but didn't argue. He kept his eyes on the king. ""Weasleys have been in Gryffindor for generations.""

Cedric let out a long breath as the meaning behind Ron's questions became clear. ""I've heard,"" he said. ""But you know you don't have to go there if you don't want to.""

Ron snorted. ""Yeah, like the twins would ever let me live that down.""

""It's not up to them,"" said Cedric firmly. ""And if they tried to give you any problems then I'd deal with it.""

Ron looked up at that, his eyes wide with surprise, and Cedric smiled at him. ""You can go wherever you want, Ron. Even Slytherin, and don't start with that 'all Slytherins are evil' nonsense,"" he added, when Ron frowned. ""You've heard about Pettigrew in the news, and he was a Gryffindor. Dark wizards come from all houses, not just Slytherin.""

Ron looked slightly taken aback by his fervour, and Cedric reigned himself back in with an effort. He knew he had feelings about this, and he didn't want to make anyone too suspicious. Ron still didn't look entirely convinced though, and Cedric sighed.

""Look, I've got a friend who is almost definitely going to be in Slytherin, and he's one of the kindest people I've ever met. Just think about it, will you?""

Ron frowned, but he nodded. Cedric smiled, and ruffled his hair again. ""I really should get going, but I'll see you before we go back to school.""

""Okay,"" said Ron. ""Thanks, Cedric.""

Cedric smiled, and went to say goodbye to the twins. It looked like he had another project. If they were going to put an end to the destructive antagonism that had sprung up between their houses, then this was as good a place to start as any.

""We might have a problem.""

Harry tore his eyes from the Tamil dictionary he was paging through and blinked up. ""What kind of problem?""

Helena floated down to eye level. She smiled slightly as she took in what he was working on, but her expression soon turned serious. ""That prank you pulled on Professor Snape.""

Harry smirked at the reminder but Helena's next words banished all traces of amusement, ""He knows that none of his students could be behind it.""

""What?"" Harry demanded. ""How?""

Yes, it had been a new creation, but he had been careful. Nothing in that potion had been beyond the capabilities of a talented student, even one who hadn't finished their studies. 

Except Salazar had known the capabilities of every single one of his students. If Snape was half the Potions Master Harry had heard he was...

Harry groaned and let his head fall onto the desk.

""What did I miss?""

A chill touched the back of his neck as Helena drifted closer. ""You used liverwort as the catalyst. Various substitutes discovered in North America have been far more popular for centuries.""

Harry winced. He really should have thought of that. ""I'm never going to live this down.""

""You're not infallible, Uncle,"" said Helena gently. ""Not even you can absorb a thousand years of knowledge in six months.""

Harry managed a weak huff, but his mind was racing at the implications. If Snape knew that someone else was responsible for creating that potion they were going to have to be far more careful with the knowledge they displayed in class.

Well, Cedric would. Harry and Susan wouldn't have that issue for a couple of years yet. He still should have known better.

""I got cocky.""

He hated to admit it, but it was true. He had been so determined to do something, anything to protect their students, that he had let his creativity get ahead of his common sense. It wasn't a mistake he could afford to repeat.

""It's not such a disaster,"" said Helena. ""They already knew that something was going on."" A wry smile touched her face. ""You haven't exactly kept a low profile.""

Harry snorted and raised his head to look at her. ""Exorcising Binns and burning down the broom shed within the first months probably did stir some suspicions,"" he agreed. ""I expect Rowena will have something to say about that too.""

Helena's smile faltered slightly at the mention of her mother, but she covered it quickly. ""The Headmaster is looking into it. He's asked all of us to keep our eyes open, and he's been doing research into Hogwarts' earliest records.""

""For all the good that will do him,"" said Harry. Hogwarts wouldn't cooperate, not when it came to them. The ghosts were a different matter, but Harry had had plenty of practice at dodging enemies. Not that the ghosts were enemies, but it was good practice.

Still, he would have to be careful. Cedric would need to be warned. Harry took a deep breath and nodded.

""Thank you. Will you tell me if you hear anything else?""

""Of course,"" said Helena. She grinned suddenly. ""This is the most fun I've had in centuries.""

Harry burst out laughing. He couldn't help it. Helena looked absolutely delighted with herself, and the weight evaporated from Harry's shoulders. It had been too long since he had last seen his niece look like that. Helena beamed at him, and arranged herself as if sitting on the sofa next to him.

""How are you getting on with that?""

Harry wiped his eyes and refocused on the notebooks. ""Slowly. It's a beautiful language, but it's hard to learn from books.""

Helena nodded. ""Well, with any luck it won't be long until you can get lessons in person.""

Harry glanced at the latest copy of the Daily Prophet and smiled. Things were looking very promising on the godfather front, and he had received a hastily scribbled note from Sirius promising that they had a solution to his communication problems too.

Things were definitely beginning to look up."

""You have all your things?"" She asks.

""Yes, Mum."" 

She pauses for a minute then straightens her posture. ""Good. Now, then,"" she gestures to the Hogwarts Express. ""It's nearly eleven, you should be leaving."" His mother surprises him by pulling Draco into one last, brief hug and then adjusting his tie.

Draco grabs his things. ""I'll see you for Christmas, Mum."" She smiles at him and shooed him off. ""Yes, yes, I know. Go on, I'm sure your friends are waiting for you."" He raises an eyebrow. ""Mum, Hermione's the only one that's consistently on time for anything.""

""Then I'm sure you can either find her or save them all a seat. Now, go on.""

""Bye, Mum,"" Draco says as he grabs all his luggage to lug it onto the train. He makes his way through the platform, nodding politely to people even as they slightly inch away from him and his almost healed new scar from the last moon. (Just a slight scratch. Only problem is it's on the edge of his left cheek, by his ear.)

Even though it was just over half past ten, most of the compartments were already full. Draco had been right- there was no sign of even Hermione this time. He quickly abandoned the idea of a completely empty compartment and settled for one near the end of the train that only had a sleeping man in the corner seat. Must be the new Defense professor, he thought to himself. As he stowed his trunk, he saw what must have been the professor's, because it was the only other one there. R. J. Lupin was printed on the end in peeling gold lettering, and the trunk itself looked barely held together, as though it was a gift from ages ago that was well worn. The man's robes were a bit tatty as well.

Ignoring the man, Draco got out Standard Book of Spells, Grade 3, and sprawled out in his normal fashion to read until Harry, Ron and Hermione managed to find their way to his compartment. 

By the time the train had started moving, he was slightly worried- he doubted anyone wanted a repeat of last year. But just as he had made up his mind to search the train for them, the door slided open and he saw Hermione's face poke in. ""Draco!""

""Oh, good, we found him,"" he heard Ron tell Harry as the three made their way into the compartment. 

""Careful,"" Draco half-whispered to them, ""Think he's asleep.""

Harry quietly slid the door closed again. ""What do you reckon?"" He asked after they had all moved their trunks. ""Never had an adult on the Express before.""

Draco pointed to the man's suitcase exactly as Hermione did the same, while saying, ""My bet's on Defense professor.""

""Oh, bloody hell,"" Ron said, which earned him an elbow and a hissed ""Ron!"" from Hermione. ""Everyone knows it's jinxed, right? He looks like a cold could finish him off!"" He tried to defend himself amidst Harry and Draco's conspiratorial glance and then chuckles.

""To be fair, he does look a bit ill,"" Harry remarked. ""Speaking of ill-"" he pointed to Draco's cheek. Hermione and Ron must have not seen it before, because Hermione gasped while Ron practically shouted a slew of curses that made even Harry look away from Draco's cheek to elbow the redhead to shut up as to not wake the professor. 

Draco, meanwhile, turned his face away from the three towards the window with a muttered, ""I'm fine."" When he glanced at the trio, he was met with three sets of raised eyebrows. ""Oh, come off it. I'm fine. Really.""

""Uh huh.""

""Sure, mate.""

""Absolutely perfect.""

""You three are the worst."" There was an awkward pause, then all four busted out into laughter. The fit lasted a few minutes, but once it had died down, it was Ron who broke the mood. ""In all seriousness, though- are you really okay?"" Draco gave him a shrug. ""It is what it is. Couldn't get our hands on a full batch last time. Not as bad as it could have been, but, still.""

""Well,"" Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper, ""You guys should be happy to know that I finally got my hands on the book.""

""What?"" Harry said out loud before remembering to whisper because of the guest to their conversation. ""How?"" He added quieter. ""Diagon Alley,"" She replied. ""Managed to find it in a secondhand shop. Bit worn, but perfectly readable.""

""Excellent,"" Ron added. 

""Guys, not that I'm not appreciative, but you really don't have to do this,"" Draco tried to interject, but there was no stopping Hermione Granger on a mission. ""Draco,"" she said to him. ""We've all thought about it. All of us have agreed. We want to do this for you.""

""Yeah, okay, but breaking the law? That's a lot. Are you really, absolutely, sure you all want to do this? If you get caught, you could go to Azkaban.""

""If. And we all know the risks, mate,"" Ron told him. 

""Besides,"" Harry interjected. ""What's life without a little rule-breaking?"" 

Draco sighed. ""Well, am I outvoted on this one, then?""

""Yep,"" Ron said, which really summed it all up. 

Hermione pulled the book out of her bag. ""It's incredibly complicated- even more than the polyjuice. I've only glanced over it- probably best for all of us to read it together.""

""Yeah, probably best,"" Harry agreed.

""So, Harry, you said you had something to tell all of us once we met up with Draco-"" Hermione gasped in a little bit and cut her sentence short when she heard a soft snore from Lupin. The four silently gazed at each other for a long minute. ""Alright,"" Harry said after their pause had gone on for what felt like forever, ""I think he's still asleep.""

Draco breathed a sigh a relief. The last thing they needed was an interrogation from a teacher they didn't know. He directed his attention to the dark haired boy. ""Okay, what were you going to tell us?""

""Right,"" Harry said before giving himself a small Shake of the head. ""So, Ron, last night I heard your parents talking- arguing more like- because your dad wanted to tell me that Sirius Black escaped Azkaban to come after me.""

""Bloody hell, mate-""

""Harry-""

Draco just raised his eyebrow and motioned for the other boy to continue. ""And he also made me swear that I wouldn't go looking for Black. Which also explains why Fudge wasn't even mad that I blew up Aunt Marge, he was just all huffy that I stormed off afterwards.""

He did a double take. ""Wait, you blew up your aunt?"" Draco asked incredulously. Ron started snickering for what looked to be a second time, due to the fact that Hermione seemed to be expecting it and then elbowed him a second after he began. ""It's not funny, Ronald Weasley!"" But Draco had started chuckling as well. ""It kind of is, Hermione.""

""Oh, not you, too,"" She sighed. ""Boys,"" She muttered. Harry rolled his eyes at the others' antics. ""Well, it was an accident. She was spouting all this crap about my mum and dad, and it's not like Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were discouraging her. At all.""  

""Yeah, I s'pose,"" Ron said. ""Hey,"" he continued, ""When do you think the trolley will be coming?""

After that, the conversation turned to simple chatter. Draco tuned out for some of it, though he learned some interesting things. Hermione got a cat that Ron thought was the Devil. The Cannons were doing terribly (as usual). Harry liked his birthday presents, and he made sure to thank Ron for the Sneakoscope, Hermione for the Broom Service Kit, and Draco for the Indian cookbook he got him. 

""Was a bummer I haven't had the chance to use it, but that's to be expected. Still, thanks,"" he told Draco.

Nothing eventful really happened after that, until the trolley came. ""Finally,"" Ron exclaimed. I'm starving.""

""Ron, it's only been a couple hours since breakfast,"" Hermione said, exasperated.

""Exactly! A couple hours!"" The redhead replied, which resulted in a groan from Hermione. Draco himself only got some pumpkin cakes and more than probably necessary chocolate frogs.

""You, my friend,"" Harry said pointedly, ""Have an obsession with that stuff.""

""Chocolate is superior to everything. I stand by that,"" Draco told him, trying to defend himself.

The sleepy lull of the journey returned, excluding when they managed to use Lupin to their advantage to avoid anything with Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle, for once. Draco had arrived in his robes, so after lunch Hermione and the other two boys went to change. ""Best get it over with early, I guess,"" Harry had conceded, and Ron followed by shrugging. 

When they left, Draco almost decided to pick up where he left off in Standard Book of Spells, but then changed his mind and pulled out The Hobbit. When the other three returned, Hermione followed his lead and pulled out one of her own books (Hogwarts, a History, if Draco wasn't mistaken). Ron and Harry showed no interest in reading their books, so they ended up talking just to each other (Exploding Snap would have woken the professor up, Ron didn't have his chess set in his bag- but that might have woken up the professor too, so it was just as well).

Hours later, Draco had almost finished the book when suddenly the train stopped, pulling him out of the pages. Hermione had been startled out of her book as well, and the four looked at each other with confusion. ""Surely we're not there yet?"" Hermione asked.

""No, I don't think so,"" replied Harry. 

None of them had to ponder on it for very long as the lights went out just as Harry poked his head through the door."

Not everyone was brave.

She wasn't brave.

She couldn't be the protagonist of this story that everyone wanted her to be. Not that anyone in this new life knew what she was meant to be, what she would become.

No, Lily Potter while not knowing what would happen, the pain and agony she- he, her baby would face, a pig to the slaughter. For now she was just a woman in the middle of the war trapped in the ""safe"" house with her husband slowly going stir crazy, but trying to power through it. It didn't help that their darling baby boy was deadly silent, making both parents worry. At first, the child had cried for days on end, unable to be soothed then one day he just stopped. They were worried but what could they do? No one but Sirius knew where they were at, and he wasn't that knowledgeable in child care nor healing spells that they would need to check over Harry's mental and physical growth.

They didn't know the turmoil that roared inside their baby's little head, the tiny squishy brain trying to handle the onslaught of memories of another life, of the body dysmorphia, of the fact she had lost everything. 

She was sorry, so sorry at the sight of their dark circles under their eyes, all caused by her wails of terror that went on for weeks unable to understand what was happening around her. But she only wished to see her real mother, who raised her with a firm hand, yet let the softness of herself show in private. Of their native roots that most would spit at, or try to claim for brownie points. She wanted her mothers out of tune singing, her true singing voice only coming through when she spoke the language of their people, a beautiful, deep soothing sound.

Not a woman of white freckled skin, bright auburn hair, and a voice that was so beautiful that if she had been herself, she would've loved to listen to her. Not of a father, with dark skin, worlds apart from the movie she watched so long ago, and the books that never spoke of a skin color at all. Not a father with dark brown eyes so deep and loving that she started to cry knowing she would lose it all. He was so kind, so sweet, and gentle with her, taking an active part in her new life.

She tried not to get attached, and with her new mother it was easier she had a mother to hold onto but... Not a father, and found she wasn't sure if she could survive without them. He was the father she never had, as the first was a wandering vagabond doing his best to get out of the rez and selling cheap shit from their culture to mildly curious white people. Now all it did was remind her of everything she had lost, and would continue to not have in this new world, of the more things she would come to lose  if she kept living.

The life of one little boy didn't matter, in the very end, when it came to the life and happiness of a whole magical world. The life of one man and one woman, wouldn't matter either in the grand scheme of things. Even if the non-magical outnumbered them three to one. She could understand that- she really could, it was a hard choice, a damning choice. Damned if she did and damned if she didn't. Let one little boy live with his small family while thousands other little children were slaughtered, or end everything with three lives? It seems easy, when one was thinking of it with cool detachment. No attachment to the people there, which is why she couldn't understand why Dumbldore could look Lily, James and her in the eye with seemingly no remorse for what he was doing. Without attachment or understanding she could understand, but these two were children he had watched grown, had even spoken too, and mentored.

The thing was, she was selfish. So selfish and she knew it. She wasn't brave either, she was terrified of the abuse, terrified of pain, of doctors, bills, the government and every other aspect of life. She had barely begun to live in her other life, saving up to buy an apartment at the very least. Now she was back to square one staring up at the ceiling with a dead gaze able to hear the hushed whispers of her parents from the doorway as they watched her motionless form. The only way the two twenty-one year old's knew that their child still lived was the slow rise and fall of his tiny chest.

""James, I'm terrified- something is wrong with Harry, he doesn't laugh he doesn't smile or eat as much as he's suppose too I just-"" and Lily's voice cracked, the sound making her tiny body shiver subconsciously at the height of emotion. She was far too deep in her mind for the emotional impact to do anything to her, to fully hit her on a conscious level. She could hear them, could see them even if they were blurry figures in the distance but-

""I know Lily-flower. I just wish I knew what to do."" James' voice was thick as well, and if she could see clearly she would've been able to see the tears already streaming down his cheeks from the uncertainty of if their child would even live to see his first birthday.

If she had it her way, she wouldn't. She- she- a name lost to time and memories, so in a fit of inspiration she came up with a new name. Emory. A name for now, for her own purpose because she was different then the woman who had been lost to time.

""Mum and dad would've known what to do,"" James voice, horse with emotion spoke, wavering the pain of his parents loss still heavy in his chest.

""Mine too,"" Lily murmured in agreement.

Emory knew that Lily Potters parents were still alive out there, she had been the one to listen to this new life's mother mutter and curse to herself as she built wards right in front of her meant to protect them. Lily wouldn't know that her parents wouldn't make it through the war, but also could hear her and James talk in hushed whispers in bed about where she/he would go if they were to die. (She was sure that she should've been moved to the nursery by now, but whenever Lily hedged the question James venomously refused. Lily seemed to relax as if all she had wanted was her husband to disagree so that she could put the move off for another time.) Lily's parents were the second on the list, the first being Sirius under the pretense that him, Remus and Peter would raise her together. Lily's parents second, with the help of the Longbottom's to stay connected to the magical world in ways to be sure nothing was headed their way.

It was sad, listening to Lily cry, and talk about how if the worst happened, her parents would love her son dearly.

Emory though, wasn't brave enough to live even if she had the guarantee of being raised by Lily's parents.

Which is what leads her to now, clutching a metal fork she had stolen from lunch and looking for an outlet in hopes that Lily Potter, so connected to the non-magical world would've had this place installed with electricity even if it was a magical home. The starving hadn't worked, after refusing to eat for three days her dad- James, who apparently was proficient in healing would just spell her mothers milk (ew) into her stomach once the both realized she wouldn't eat on her own.

""Hey little man, what'cha up too,"" a deep vice called as she cursed inside her brain, crawling faster down the hall as if to get away from him. She was so close, she could feel it- if she could just get down the stairs and to the living room with the fork she swore she saw an outlet in the kitchen.

""Oh whoa hold up!"" James cried out as she crawled even faster towards the stairs, his fingers missing her by a hairs breath. Electrocution wasn't the most painless way to die, but she needed to do something quick before that time came. They could have another baby- she was sure Lily was already pregnant anyway because she had a thoughtful hand over her stomach. (Not like they had much else to do trapped in the house like this. Oh, if only she had some bleach to drink to forget the sounds!) They could have a normal, happy baby that wasn't an imposter wearing the skin of an infant.

She jumped, which was more of a flop, feeling the air whizz by as she tumbled down the stairs, tiny arms flailing, the fork having been dropped in the chaos. The only feeling that raced through her was regret that Jams had to see this. Her fathers scream of horror quickly called Lily to his side, the door to her potion brewing room slamming open as she rushed with her wand in hand. She was too late though, a gasp of her own ripping from her throat as the sight of her son falling form. 

Emory didn't have time to feel excited at her nearing death, her actions not planned out, she could only hope it was swift- When her head cracked on the wooden step she didn't black out, her tiny baby body didn't even break a bone. Her head bounced off the step as if it was a bouncy ball. She continued to bounce down the stairs, screaming all the way in her fit of anger at her failure. She had been starving herself for fucks sake, she shouldn't have enough magical power to protect herself!

""HARRY,"" Lily yelled, her wand snapping out her magic swirling around Emory's tiny baby body, cushioning her. The next thing she knew she was being clutched tightly in Lily's arms. ""Oh my god- Oh my god, you're oaky- he's okay oh fuck James that scared the shite out of me, fuck, fuck please don't you ever do that again."" Lily kissed the top of Emory's head, over and over again, cuddling her close and practically squeezing the life out of her. Ha, ha if only. Rocking her back and forth in a soothing motion to stop her wails.

James seemed shell shocked, standing in place at the top of the stairs as if a statue, while Emory tried to thrash out of Lily's arms, green eyes filling with tears, but not for the reason that both Lily and James assumed it was. She wailed, harder and louder then anything she had before, causing both parents to jump into action, soothing murmurs, gentle touches, and singing lullabies, or trying to distract her with magic that she couldn't even take joy in because they were going to die and she was going to be the cause of it.

If only her fucking magic didn't save her.

When I was younger I was going through a lot of things, I had this story idea of basically a suicidal self-insert like character being placed as Harry Potter trying to kill herself only to never succeed. Back then I thought it was such a great joke, ""haha you want to die so bad yet the world thwarts you at every turn, making you live your miserable life."" Now that I'm older I think the real reason I never let the character die was because I had hoped my life was worth saving no matter how much I wished for it to end.

That I was worth saving.

I found the work recently while trying to clean out some things in my room and edited until it was something I didn't mind sharing. Not sure if this is for myself, to show myself silently how much I have changed; or for others out there feeling the same way. Real cheesy I get it, but honestly while hanging on is the hardest shit you are ever going to do in this life, if you keep moving forward no matter how slow time feels, you will find that reason to live. Life doesn't get easier, not always, but it's not as bad as everyone told you it's going to be. It's just different from what you expect and sometimes... Different, while scary isn't always a bad thing. Just keep on going, no matter what happens because there are a billion people out there, and you will find that love comes from the craziest of places.

Emory finds that the world she thought she knew, wasn't all that it's cracked up to be. If one thing was different, then did she really have the right to say she knew what else happened in this world? Maybe she was wrong about it all- then again there are some things that just never change no matter what world you're in.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The world that Emory had found herself in was different, neither movie, nor books could prepare her for the un-predictableness of them all. Of James, who was desi, Indian- not the type she had been called as a child, and had called herself that as well. He had such a deep connection with his culture, one even she hadn't had with her tribe. Somewhere along the way of moving off of the rez she had found that she had lost it. Between people telling her she didn't have dark enough skin to be a native, from others assuming since she called herself an Indian that she was a racist white person trying to pretend to be native to get brownie points. The shame of practicing her spiritual beliefs in the open, of even speaking of her tribe was all there, even though she was apart of that culture since the beginning. 

The more she tried to shape herself, to fit in the new political climate of the world, the more she was beaten down. Changing her speech from Indian, to native, even then some folks had a problem with how she referred to herself. She had like using native, it was a broader term, she didn't have to go speaking of which tribe to people who wouldn't know how to pronounce the words. Yet, in this world for women and native women at that, it was all about proving herself to get some sliver of respect. Even when she showed her knowledge of her own tribe, they still berated her for not calling herself native American as was ""proper"". That she was only making it worse for her brothers, sisters and siblings in blood. Defending themselves, once they found out she was truly native, still finding some way to say she was in the wrong, and that they were right.

What right did they have? Her people were the ones that had died, some colonizer from Europe had no damn right in telling HER how she should refer to herself, of what her people were going through. 

They didn't know anything.

It wasn't just them, others who were just like her, a minority in the majority, would push her tribes troubles down, fighting for the spotlight, to be seen when that's what the government wanted them to do in the first place. To fight amongst each other until none was left. They had to stand together- yet, everyone seemed to hate natives. A stain covered up with a rug. She wondered if this is what the Armenians felt like when their people were slaughtered right in front of  their eyes by the Ottoman empire, and all they were to the outside world, were a passing page in the history books never to be taught in American schools nor known like the holocaust was.

It was heartbreaking.

She had a new reason to cry tonight, even though James spoke of some special night in Hindu culture coming up that he wanted to share with her, that she couldn't come to accept. She didn't care about what he was talking about, she wanted her life back, the pow wows, the dances, standing around the bonfire as they roasted some deer you accidentally ran over. To use everything before burying the bones to give thanks for the things they were given and use every bit of the animal.

There was so much waste in America.

British people seemed to be just as wasteful.

She grumbled in baby distaste, as she watched Sirius vanish the burnt cake he had made. The shaggy haired man, had put a finger to his lips, a dramatic shush. He was so goofy looking, that if she was herself, she would've laughed easily. Instead she scowled deeply, before going back to smacking blocks together in annoyance. If she was going to be annoyed then she would annoy Sirius with her sounds until he left her alone.

She never had a Godfather, nor a Godmother- and she didn't care for one either. She didn't need him, and he best learn it fast.

""Ah, fine grumpy pants, go tattle on me once you know how to speak,"" Sirius huffed, sounding like a tired old dog. ""If you ever learn too speak."" 

She sent him a poisonous glare, but in the end it probably looked like she just closed her eyes. She could talk! At least, she could before. She wasn't sure, right now, she had tried tirelessly when everyone else was asleep or too busy to try to make sounds that were words, but it was so hard. It was beyond humiliating, so why should she try anyway. She wasn't going to live long enough for these people to find out in the first place.

She fully ignored the worry that was painted across Sirius' face, the same that was on her parents as she missed most baby milestones. 

""Well either way you're soon going to be a baldy baby,"" Sirius snickered as he started to silently send out cleaning charms around the disastrous kitchen. ""James parents did it to him when he was a baby, showed me the pictures the first summer I came here and man he looked ridiculous let me tell you. Though his parents had a barber and a priest for his first hair cut. He's going to do it for you too, even though he can't follow it by the letter, and then he'll show your boyfriend, or girlfriend whichever, those pictures like his parents showed me.""

Her brows which had been furrowed as she aggravatingly slammed letter blocks together, soothed by Sirius' voice. Her throat suddenly felt thick, as being queer when she was younger wasn't nearly as acceptable to her mom. She hadn't even known that you could be gay until she turned twelve an had seen two women kissing. She sniffled quietly, trying not to give into her baby instincts to wail out, and search for those familiar warm arms of James to hide in. 

""Hey little fawn,"" Sirius voice was hesitant, as he had walked over, sliding his wand into his wand holster. She couldn't see him that well due to her baby eyes. She wasn't crying, not again- she's already cried too many times in front of strangers an she couldn't-

""Shhh hey it's okay,"" Sirius voice was smooth, low- not like her fathers that rumbled, Sirius' was more like a purr. Which she was sure he'd love to be told he sounded more like a cat than a dog. His thin arms wrapped around her tiny body, resting her against his chest making sure her ear was pressed to his skin, to listen to his heart beat.  

""Hey if you're that upset about being bald we can always give you a hair growth potion then you'll have luscious locks just like mine.""

""That,"" James voice called from down the hall, growing closer as he made his way to the living room. ""Defeat's the purpose of Mundan, and you know it."" He sounds as if he's chiding him, a familiar argument. He doesn't look angry, the way Emory was use to seeing folks being when they fought but sometimes people were tricky...

""What, by forcing our poor baby fawn to be bald? Oh the misery!"" Sirius swayed, making Emory feel a little sick as she clutched onto his t-shirt tightly in response. Her godfather's, (she assumed, they haven't told her, but then why would you tell a baby stuff like this anyway, they wouldn't understand normally) arms, weren't as muscular as James own. Her father- dad- da? Had muscles for days, while Sirius' strength came in his speed, his legs, his arms on the other hand were akin to twigs. 

""We aren't shaving your head padfoot,"" James scoffed, but his eyes twinkled, a little bit of the brightness alighting in them. ""Only made that mistake once."" 

""He thinks you got something from your past holding you down,"" Sirius mock whispered his stubble rubbing gently against her baby cheek. She still didn't laugh, even though for once she wanted to being reminded of her grandfather... ""So shaving you bald will get rid of all of that stuff from the past lives your soul lived."" 

""It's not as if Annaprasanam went as planned,"" James muttered more to himself then to the both of them but they could still hear him. She had no clue what the word that he spoke was, but by the way understanding dawned upon Sirius' face he seemed to know.

""Jamie, you couldn't have known that Harry would be this sickly as a baby... It's not your fault, okay? He's getting better-"" Sirius moved closer to James making something squirm in her stomach. James was crying again, having taken off his glasses, and rubbing frantically at his eyes. She wanted to be as far away from this as possible, she hated seeing him cry.


it made her think of herself, so easy to cry when alone yet a face of stone in front of others.


She instead found herself squished in the middle of a hug between best friends. While Emory wanted to be as far away from this breakdown as possible, she was far too tired to try to demand to be put down. ""Sure while it won't be the first solid food that Harry has ever eaten, it will be the first solid food that you haven't had to spell into his stomach. We just gotta convince him to eat a bit and show him that he won't throw it back up.""

She closed her eyes, feeling James tremble in the hug as Sirius pat his back with his one free arm.

""Pads I'm just so scared- Lily is too. What if something happens? I can't even let my son sleep in the nursery by himself because what if he stops breathing during the night? I can't sleep, I can barely eat some days. I want to take Harry to the healer but Dumbldore says it's too dangerous, and we don't have anyone in the order that specializes in child care!""

Sirius started to tremble too, but there was something sparking in the air, making it feel thick, reminding her of humid nights at home during the summers. It was dark, threatening to choke her, yet cool, as if smooth crisp water was being poured down her throat.

""Fuck Dumbdlore.""

Emory's eyes flicked open, practically bulging out of her head as she craned her head to try to look up at Sirius' face. His jaw was set, sticking it out in a rebellious way that she would've easily thought he'd done it all his life. Twin gasps reached their ears making her aware that Lily had just walked in, stray hairs fighting their way out of her ponytail. The dark eyebags were horrendous and she started to wonder just how long Lily had been brewing potions.

""Sirius..."" James murmured for the first time sounding, unsure of himself.

""I meant it,"" Sirius hissed, she could practically feel his hackles rising as he let James go. Emory for the first time realized Sirius towered over her father in height, just like Lily did. ""Fuck him- you two could go to a muggle doctor under polyjuice, none would be the wiser!""

James' jaw practically dropped to the floor in his shock as Sirius continued sounding as if he was gearing up for a rant of some sort.

""Look, I respected him, but after what happened in school, and this war- I... I can admit he let us get away with way too much over other students. I was a right prat, irresponsible too but he didn't even try to curve it and I've had to learn the hard way. I can't just watch you two kill yourselves over this either; worrying if Harry is going to live. We're adults, we can make our own choices! We don't need to look up to an adult, and ask if we can pretty please go outside. We never cared in school, so why do we fucking care now of all times? Why do we care what Dumbldore thinks when it's Harry's life that's on the line right now!""

""Oh dear god."" Lily looked like she was about to fall over and faint, be it from the potion fumes she had been working with or- or whatever the fuck was going on in this house because this was off script. This was way off fucking script because Sirius of all people was meant to be a staunch Dumbldore approver, he wasn't meant to say these things. To- to plant some seed of doubt in their brains, he was meant to never learn, to be a teenager stuck in his past, rot in jail for twelve years then die.

""Don't you dare think I haven't noticed why you've been holed up in your potions room Lily Potter,"" Sirius continued, patting Emory's back in comfort as he stalked over to Lily. James had apparently flopped into a chair as if his whole world had been twisted on it's axis. ""You've been trying to find some potion that could cure Harry. Well tough shit you don't know everything!""

Lily's eyes turned cold, lips pursed, nostrils flaring and Sirius steam rolled ahead while Emory felt her own heart beat far too fast in her fear of just what he was doing. ""You don't know everything, you aren't an all seeing God Lily because you are human. Human like me, human like your parents, like James. I can't believe I'm the one having to knock some sense into you both so here it is.""

He quickly backed away before Lily could swipe at him, standing in the middle of the room he jumped atop the coffee table, looking down at both Lily and James.

""It's okay to ask for help!"" He spoke, voice raised but not fully a shout, he continued. ""Jamie taught me that, and it looks like I have to teach him, and you all over again! What happened to the James that came to his friends first? What happened to the Lily that would take her mental health breaks because they were 'oh so important I've come to learn.' "" The last words Sirius had pitched his voice up, mocking Lily's own as he raised a brow towards them both.

The tempers were rising in the room, and Emory suddenly found herself whisked away from Sirius arms, into James, wand out and spells casted so fast that it happened in between a blink. She got the back end of a ""WHAT HAPPENED? YOU ASKED WHAT HAPPENED WELL I'LL TELL YOU-"" as Lily shouted at Sirius  and the man just took it. Whatever charm was up kept her from hearing their argument but she didn't hear the fake murmurs of people either so it wasn't the muffling charm...

""It's been a long day,"" James murmured into her hair. ""I think it's time for us both to take a nap, don't you think?""

For once, Emory couldn't agree more with him.

EDIT:

It was brought to my attention that I should've explained what Mundan and Annaprasanam are to those unaware. I am not desi, I simply did some research on google, and while I might not be knowledgeable with Hindu culture the times I do mention it I will have done research for the subject. 

Mundan: Is one of the ritual that's preformed on a baby's first birthday. Mundan is when you shave off all the hair on your baby's head. The shaving is believed to cleanse the child of any wrong doings carried over from a past life and allows the child a fresh start in this life. The priest will bless the barber and scatter the hair in the river as an offering

Annaprasanam: It's another ritual done though not necessarily on a first birthday it can be. It's where you give your baby their first solid foods. It's meant to signify the development of health in the baby.

We take a look through Sirius eyes to see what's happening in the inter mechanism of the marauders friendships. Old wounds seem to come to light, and suddenly maybe everything wasn't as stable as he had thought they were. All Sirius can do is hope he's not to late to save his friends, and their brotherly bond.

The sharp smell of alcohol would've overwhelmed him if he wasn't so use to it all. Sirius Black, like all men his age always liked a good drink. Though, before Harry was born he indulged far too much in drinks, pretty women and men alike until the reality that he was in a war shattered his ""playboy"" lifestyle. Playboy in quotation marks because he could, in the end, never find it in himself to go off and have sex with the people he wooed. Something always stopped him from fully going through it. Maybe he was broken, maybe he didn't want sex- hell if he knew what it was. He just always felt sick to his stomach, and wanted to go back home.

Back to Jamie.

Back to Lily-flower.

And after Harry was born, he found the idea of going to bars, to dance without his friends well... What was the point when they weren't all together? He sighed heavily into his drink, as Fleetwood Mac played over the old speakers. It sounded gritty, muffled, and one would have to struggle to hear over the murmuring of the other people in the bar. Thankfully or maybe not so, he had the sensitive hearing, (among other things) of a dog and was able to tune into the song.

He started to hum the tune, feeling something heavy in his chest as the crooning words, ""Find emerald eyes in the night, Gleamin' shiny and bright, As if covered with silverrrr! "" played over the speaker. 

He swayed in his seat, probably looking three sheets to the wind, utterly pissed drunk, murmuring to himself, ""Emerald eyes is a mystery; She's my place of serenity."" He didn't mind what anyone else thought, it would keep people from bothering him as he stewed over what happened today.  

""Back to your bar hopping, eh Padfoot?""

The voice snapped Sirius out of his slump revery, perking up as he saw Peter, and Remus draw closer. Remus easily cuts a pathway through the packed bar; it helped that even while calm, Remus had this wild air about him. He had been losing contact with him recently, the other seemingly falling into some thrall. Peter was hiding slightly behind Remus, which wasn't surprising, the other man didn't like bars or dancing, far more comfortable staying home.

""Not really,"" he huffed, moving the shot glass across the wood, sliding it back and forth between his hands. ""Just couldn't think of what to do, was bored ya know?""

""Is this about Harry,"" Peter said, his sky blue eyes looking far to knowing. He hated that about Peter, the bloke was far too observant for his own good with zero filter when he got talking. 

His face scrunched up at the comment, feeling something twisting in his chest at the call out. 'I liked it better when you were silent.' The sharp retort was on the tip of his tongue, only to die in his throat as Peter looked at him with... Not accusing eyes as he had always assumed to go along with his blunt tone of voice. The man seemed to generally want to know if it was about Harry.

Remus sighed, greenish brown eyes flashing a familiar amber, signaling how close to the surface the wolf was, his shoulders relaxing when Sirius didn't lash out. And it was funny- the more he started to think of everything going on around him, the more he realized that, in his pursuit to be nothing like his parents, that he hurt his friends during it. That he was pushing his friends away when all he wanted to do was hold them closer.

It was probably why Peter was so silent now as an adult, why he never spoke about what was going on inside his head because Sirius had always seen it as a weakness to show worry or sadness. He would always get awkward when the younger boy cried, or lashed out at him for it or even for things that Sirius was starting to realize he had put in the other boy's mouth. Peter just never seemed to realize why he shouldn't ask people some questions until someone explained it to him. Not that his best mate was stupid, but it was bizar how one moment he was pants with most school related things, then he'd say something so profound that it twists your head round the bend. 

""Yes,"" Sirius replied, having promised himself he would be better. Though his voice was still clipped, drawing a snort from Remus as he slid into the booth across from him, Peter quickly joined them, still looking tentative.

""Has he gotten worse or..."" The blond trailed off, nervously picking at his fingernail looking away from him, unable to meet his eye as he asked. Remus was talking to the waiter, ordering his drinks then some water for Peter, though the way Remus tilted his head showed he was listening as well.

""No, it's still the same. Refuses to eat, has to have food spelled into his stomach, Lily's been experimenting with nutrient potions ever since Harry was born. They've mixed it in with the food they spell into his stomach and his body is getting stronger. They just haven't figured out why he won't eat..."" 

He trailed off, having more to say but he wasn't sure if Lily even knew yet. James would have to know through his superior sense of smell, was probably waiting for her to come to him about it. It really wasn't his right to talk about it if-

Remus' nose wrinkled, brows furrowing as he gave him a knowing look. Peter looked like he was already zoning out, a frown on his face. His button nose wasn't twitching but it was a close thing as he leaned forward, resting his cheek into the palm of his hand. He was obviously thinking about something, but what he didn't know.

""Why do you smell pregnant,"" Peter blurted out, before his face turned white at his words swiftly covering his mouth as if he could stuff said words back down his throat.

Sometimes Sirius really wished he wasn't surrounded by animagus and a werewolf; it made keeping secrets hard unless they remembered to cast scent stifling spells.

With a heavy sigh, face planting into the wooden table with a low groan. He'd already been chewed out by Lily once today; he didn't need this to become a repeat act. 

""I doubt Pads the one that's pregnant,"" Remus drly responded raising a brow at him before glancing at Peter who looked confused. ""Pete, he hasn't suddenly grown the parts needed for it, it's obviously Lily's scent."" 

Peter blinked owlishly, looking from Remus to Sirius, lips parted in a little 'oh' before exclaiming ""what, again?"" 

""You calling her a slag wormtail,"" Sirius growled, lifting his head from the table feeling defensive. Peter gave him a confused look, whilst Remus grumbled into his glass of whiskey the waiter had just dropped off, quickly leaving when the word slag was thrown out sensing an impending fight. 

""What?? No I didn't say that,"" Peter seemed to backtrack looking at Sirius as if he was the one who had a few screws loose. ""Look I can't imagine that there's not a lot for them to do cooped up in the house, but shouldn't they- they uh, shouldn't they slow down?""

And with Peter's explanation any itching for a fight, no matter how pathetic died a quick death as the anxiety was obvious in Peter's face. He glanced from Sirius, then to Remus, speaking slowly as if to make sure he got the words out correctly. ""Not that I'm not happy for them, but one baby is a lot of stress. You've been telling me how sick Harry is, and that his magic was the only thing keeping him going in the early days."" 

Sirius tried not to glare at Remus, having been unable to contact him and having had to rely on Peter for a shoulder to cry on during that time. Which was very difficult to do. Not because Peter wouldn't listen, but there was always something fragile about him. He always felt guilty having to tell Peter, who was already stressing over the war, his mum, and his prick of a dad that boasted about taking down death eaters, but would turn right back around and treat his muggle wife like shit. Irony wasn't even the first word Sirius thought of, when he thought of Mr. Pettigrew.

""Isn't another new baby a bad idea when Harry isn't even out of the woods yet,"" Peter continued, having noticed the silent conversation that Sirius and Remus were having. ""Guys don't do that,"" he snapped, making both men jump in their seats from the almost shout, stopping them from glaring.

Peter's face was flushed red, making his face look ruddy, his annoyance clear as day. ""I-"" there was a pause as he shook, he looked parts scared and parts angry yet also determined in a way Sirius had rarely seen. ""I- I can't stand when you do that! Those silent arguments an other bullcrap. Or  the way you two leave me out of the loop because you think poor little wormy can't handle it- well no shit I can't handle it because you guys don't warn me about what's happening! It... it makes me feel like-""

Oh fuck.

Peter was crying, his round face screwed up in pain as fat tears rolled down his cheeks, taking in sharp breaths, fingers gripping the table as if it was his only support. ""It makes me feel like you guys don't like me, you know? I- I know im stupid, it's okay you don't have to tell me I've heard it all in Hogwarts. That i'm just some little lump of a boy following around real wizards an taking credit for things you do, riding on your coat tails.""

""You aren't-"" Sirius hissed feeling anger bubble up in his chest at the insult- the multiple insults. 

Peter only laughed at him, wiping his eyes while shaking his head. ""Sirius I'm fucking fat, and I didn't get the best grades until Remus started tutoring me. I'm not blind. What did you think people were going to think of me? I'm always going to be fat first, a person second. Everyone in the order already thinks I gorge myself on the rashings at the safe houses anyway."" 

""Who called you all that- I'll- I'll!"" He didn't know what he would do but it would be something. Something that would make his teenage self proud. That probably wasn't a good thing

""You did.""

What.

""What,"" Sirius spoke, baffled from Peter's admittance.

""You and James both, you didn't call me a lump specifically but you both use to tease me about my weight all the time in school."" Peter looked terrified at his own admittance, but some heavy weight seemed to fall from his shoulders, letting go of something that must have been weighing down on him. He went from hunched over, to a straightened spine. ""You made fun of how long it took me to do my school work until Remus got you to stop, and apologize. That was in second year.""

""I- Peter I'm sorry,"" Sirius crocked out, all of his worries seemingly to come to the light. More wrong doings that he had unknowingly committed against his friends. Memories that he couldn't for the life of him place but knew it had to be true. It chilled him to the bone, because he knew he didn't remember it because to him it was just another day.

""I knew you two didn't mean it in a- a mean way that you wanted me to hurry up so we could hang out together, but it still hurt. It still hurts me now because you're meant to be my friends and you made me- made me feel lesser than you.."" 

The obvious 'I can't forgive you yet"" was clear in his eyes.

There was a long silence between them all, as Remus and Peter pretend not to see Sirius silently cry knowing the man wouldn't appreciate it. James was the only one he'd ever let him watch cry, and in a way this was a bigger step for the three of them. Not that they would know how important this moment would be in the future. It was surely a big step for Sirius at the very least, as normally anything like this would have him reacting like a scared dog backed in a corner, lunging forward to bite whatever was trying to trap him before running off in the chaos.

""It was McGonagall, wasn't it,"" Remus asked the question, clearly rhetorical as through his blurry teary eyes Sirius could see that the werewolf didn't seem surprised by his own words just tired.

""W-Well not those exact words,"" Peter stuttered, ringing his hands together looking ashamed of himself for speaking. Which Sirius didn't like. ""She was at Rosmerta's, talking to- um I didn't recognize who, I think it was her brother or someone that was visiting her. An I was in my you know what so she didn't know. She- uh she said I had um, separation issues, and that I needed to learn to be separate from you guys. So I could be my own person so I don't use you guys as a crutch in the real world. She wasn't sure if I could get a job either because of my anxiety with strangers. It wasn't the, you know, best thing for a kid to hear especially when I already thought that all the teachers were talking behind my back about me.""

""That- that-"" Sirius huffed, and puffed feeling a sense of betrayal from it all. The older woman he had playfully flirted with as a joke, the woman he looked up to as one of those few adults that tentatively gained his trust. The only other woman beating her out was James' own mother, the woman swiftly gaining his respect for her strength and pure stubbornness. 

His heart still ached at her loss.

""So that's why she split you up from us during fifth year,"" Remus murmured, more to himself then not. It all made perfect sense really, the three of them had all assumed it was a punishment to break up the gang even though it was mainly Peter that got the short end of the stick.

""That was the year where I had the worst grades ever,"" Peter sighed heavily, sounding tired just from thinking of that not so fun time in his life. Contrary to popular belief they didn't do Wormy's homework for him, Remus just had a good way of explaining things to him that seemed to help get the gears moving. ""I mean maybe she was a little bit right- I uh, never really made friends outside of you guys, and I honestly don't know how to. I don't really want too either an I guess that's a bad thing?""

""It doesn't matter if she was right or not, she was hypocritical,"" Sirius painfully admitted, watching as Peter's jaw dropped. Even Remus, who so far had been mainly quiet, looked surprised by Sirius' own words in Peter's defense. Was he the only one that was realizing things? Who was thinking about everything that had happened? He loved Minnie, he really did, she was the best teacher. To him, at least, maybe to others like Peter they felt differently. 

""She never broke me and James up in school; she let us stay together unless we had done something really disruptive. Then we would have detentions apart, but even then we had the mirrors. We would talk the whole way through it an while we're good at keeping secrets, she had to have figured out something was going on but never said anything. She never separated Remus from us either, it was just you-""

""I probably got off because I looked like a poor sick Victorian child,""  Remus shrugged, dragging a surprised snort from Peter. ""Who could say no to my large sunken in eyes? Surely not her knowing that I had never talked with a child my age since I was four.""

""If anyone has attachment issues out of all of us, it's Sirius with James mate,"" Peter sorted, rolling his eyes as he teased turning his face to Sirius'. ""I mean ever since you  became their secret keeper you're practically half living in that house now. Next thing we know Harry's gonna call you dad first then call James by his name.""

Sirius couldn't help himself, he laughed, a loud barking laugh that had caused a slight hush to fall over the bar. The noise only picked back up as Remus looked out to the sea of faces with a raised brow, making others flinch at the sight of his heavily scarred face. Sirius just couldn't stop laughing, real tears running down his cheeks because- because-

""PETE I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D GET THE BALLS TO JOKE LIKE THAT,"" he howled, smacking his hand on the table top as Peter flushed, this time looking pleased with himself before joining in, chuckling softly at the sight of Sirius' red face. It took a while but his laughter soon came to an end, slowly tapering off until he was breathing heavily, rubbing at his eyes while Remus seemed to take up the mother hen role since James wasn't here by handing them napkins. A peaceful silence fell over them all as they drank their drinks slowly, the air cleared, and mood looking up. He basked in it all, the closeness, the togetherness, all they were missing was James and Lily then it'd be like old times.

""Since we're all together again,"" Sirius began feeling a familiar warmth of alcohol flood his veins. ""You guys gonna show up for Harry's first birthday.""

Peter said, yes of course, but Remus looked conflicted at he question. The look on his face spoke of something... Sirius knew Remus was keeping some secret from them all, he didn't know what it was, but the change in his friend was obvious. There were new scars that he tried to hide with his longer sleeves not to mention being in the same room with Remus gave Sirius the distinct feeling of being in the same room as a predator. That the wolf was right under the surface, and was wondering the fastest way to snap their necks an have a feast.

It didn't scare him as much as one would expect. He had played with the wolf under the full moon, there was no going back from that.

'You'll be coming too, won't you Remus?' He silently thought while watching his friend, grey eyes turning stormy. He wanted so badly to trust him, but the sliver of doubt was there, the way he was pushing them all away again like it was their second year of Hogwarts all over again. He didn't know what was happening, but he had to figure it out before he lost his friend to this war.

""I will,"" Remus muttered into his drink, taking a deep drink of the rest of his whiskey before smacking the glass back down.

""Good,"" Sirius sighed, smiling at his old friend, and letting Peter's chatter about what books he's read, of cooking with his mother, and how he had found a job at a muggle bookstore. He let the others' voice be used as whitenoise for his mind, nodding along and smiling watching as Peter seemed to flourish under his half attention unaware his mind was somewhere.

Sadly, the good mood was lost.

It's Emory's first birthday in this new world, an unexpected mile stone. With the ticking clock to her new families demise hanging over their heads she's not sure if she can handle the stress of it all. Her half baked plans might come to a broil, especially when she learns that she has some special guest at her party...

Emory was awakened from her midday nap to a shout, Sirius bursting through the front door, claiming that he had to liven the place up a bit given that it was ""Harry's"" birthday and- 

""Shame on you Prongsy! You've barely decorated the place. What will Harry think when he sees this?""

""He's turning one he won't remember it,"" Lily replied drily, her voice easily carrying in the silence that followed. 

Emory struggled to get her body to work with her, rolling over on her side while trying to sit up. Now awake, she knew she wouldn't be able to go back to sleep anytime soon. Not that Sirius ever learned what quiet meant anyway. She was going to pee on him, if she could get the damn magical diaper off of her. He had planted the idea of going against Dumbledore, not that, that was bad- but now they were actually thinking of taking her to a doctor! (which was honestly much worse in her opinion then the Dumbledore thing) They were talking about having Peter and Remus polyjuice as themselves just in case someone came by which she didn't get, weren't they meant to be left alone?? Then again she guessed they still got letters, or messages from Dumbledore maybe? Though wouldn't the old man figure them out since he's been alive for a century?

There were a lot of questions, like how Remus and Peter were meant to get in, and if Peter had already started spying yet. She wasn't sure if she could stomach being around the disgusting rat man. All she could see when thinking of Peter was the warty infested looking pathetic excuse of a man from the movies. She might try to trigger her accidental magic to point Peter out as a traitor then maybe it could all work out and she'd be able to save them.

Rocking on her butt, she moved side to side, swaying as she waited for them to finish talking. When they still went at it she wondered if she could show her ""progress"" in speaking to her parents to get their attention...

She started to babble, listening as the loud voices downstairs turned hushed, amazed at the fact of how much control she had over them. She wasn't even trying to talk at all; she was only making normal baby sounds. As she continued going ""TA! TA! BA!"" smacking her hands together, she could hear pounding footsteps race up the stairs. She watched in mild amusement as James and Sirius got stuck in the bedroom doorway, pushing and shoving to get to her while Lily was watching from behind them with her green eyes twinkling in amusement.

""Ba!"" She yelled, gaining their attention, they watched her seemingly awestruck, and she had to admit it was a stroke to her ego. The fact that they were so amazed by such a simple ""achievement"" of hers. If she wasn't planning on kicking the bucket soon she'd have thought maybe she'd be more confident in this life. Maybe she would try to be one of those wonder babies and instead of saying one word she'd wait until she could say a full sentence clearly...

""Ba!"" She said, much softer tone while she pulled against the crib railing signaling she wanted out.

""Guys- do you think we could get him to say Papa?"" James asked, eyes still locked on her tiny form as if she was a miracle. He was practically jumping in place, clapping his hands together in his joy, ignoring the fact she was asking to be let out. ""Or da, would da be easier for him?""

""I think we should get him to say Padfoot,"" Sirius teased, bumping James with his elbow causing the other man to mock scowl at him.

""His first word is not going to be Padfoot!""

""BAAAAAA,"" she yelled again, shaking the side of the crib while glaring at James who was... He was looking at her with so much love, the realization took her breath away, making her stutter. Her baby body couldn't handle the sudden breath of air, making her choke, and thus ruining what soft moment they had as Lily pushed through the two men, rushing to her crib, quickly picking her up, and solidly patting her back. Emory coughed, struggling to breath for a moment, crying against Lily's shoulder and soaking her t-shirt in her tears.

""Oh baby, it's okay don't stress yourself out. You're amazing Harry, we're so proud of you, you're so brave."" Lily cooed, rubbing her back. Her traitorous body, soothed by it's mother's touch and warm voice seemed to grow liquid-y, and heavy as her eyes closed.

""Besides boys,"" Lily whispered, looking over at her husband, and Sirius with a mischievous look twinkling in her eye. ""Harry's first words will obviously be Mama, isn't that right my sweet little pumpkin!"" Emory only grumbled, smacking her lips as she let Lily hold her for once where she'd normally struggle, and try to escape. It wasn't that bad actually, Lily normally smelled like potion fumes but today she smelled like something sweet and sugary. Hiding her nose in the crook of Lily's neck she sniffled, the sugary smell stronger.

Unbeknownst to her, James had rushed out to grab the camera while Sirius fondly watched Lily, his eyes softening at the sight. Lily continued to soak up this moment with her son, her lips pulled into a small smile. Glancing up at Sirius with misty eyes, from being able to hold her son comfortably. 

""We should get him dressed, shouldn't we,"" Lily softly asked, giggling as James quietly tried to run back into the room, the camera in his hand. He started to quickly take pictures, the snapping a bit loud but one that Emory ignored. 

""Sirius you got the clothes, didn't you,"" James asked between pictures looking like a love struck fool as he did so. 

""Course I did mate, what type of friend would I be if I forgot?"" 

Cracking an eye open, Emory turned her head and watched as Sirius pulled out the outfit, the pants looked really puffy gold color, while the shirt was a red with golden accents in shapes she couldn't describe. Calling them squiggles felt offensive somehow. The black shoes had a pointed tip with what she thought was a ribbon down the middle of the toe. They looked to be very traditional clothes, though James Gryffindor bias was shining clearly in the coloring choices.

""Oh they are so cute,"" Lily squealed making Emory scowl, hiding her face once again and grumbling.

Maybe not just James' own bias then.

She resisted the best she could, but it was futile when James looked at her with tired eyes. The guilt started to worm it's way into her heart, glancing from Lily, then to James. As James' smile looked more strained, the longer this ""fight"" went on. She couldn't look at them, letting herself slowly accept what was happening just like how she had to accept when Lily would bath her in the sink.

""There we go little man, it wasn't that hard, now was it?"" Lily cooed as James seemed to come back to life, the strained smile turning to a real one. He still looked tired, but pleased that they had managed it without much of a fight on her end. 

""Go on Lils, we should get dressed- not the colorful clothes though this is Harry's day one of the muted colored ones!"" He seemed to be talking more to himself as he set Harry's feet onto the ground laughing as her legs wobbled. He kept bouncing her up and down in place, his large callused hands holding her tiny own. She gripped his fingers tightly, as tightly as her little baby fingers would allow. It was getting harder and harder not to laugh at it all, he played with her like he was a little kid. 

Her legs were still weak but even before the failure of the starvation project she had been trying to learn how to walk as fast as she could. The texture of the carpet on her body as she had been left to lay on the floor on one of those blanket things, with stuff dangling over her was atrocious, even now when she's in her baby play pin she swears she can feel the damnable thing. If she was forced to crawl across the carpet one more time she'd a bloody fit! 

Oh no- not bloody, ew British words!

""Okay- James I got a surprise for you and Lily, I know it's Harry's birthday, but we'll think of this as being a gift for him too,"" Sirius called out, winking in their direction before racing down the hall. The sound of the front door met her ears, and while she had no clue what he was up to she wasn't that worried. She really should've been, as James sent a look over her head to Lily, who then shrugged after having grabbed whatever clothes they would be changing into later that day. Emory found herself being picked up by her father and brought downstairs only to be met at the open front door with two men who were oddly enough blindfolded. Emory didn't recognize them at all, but Sirius' hands were on their backs leading them deeper into the house, closing and locking the door behind himself. 

James gasped at the sight of them, gently handing her over to Lily as he took a few steps towards the men staring at them in a sense of disbelief and wonder.

""You came,"" his voice cracked, making something strange squirm in her stomach as she really stared at these men to take them in with more detail. 

One was tall, lanky, almost like Sirius but way taller than Sirius could ever hope to be. He had blond-ish brown hair and even with half his face covered the scars upon him were ghastly. His skin was tan-ish as if he was in the sun all day, and he gave off a strange- withheld vibe that she couldn't just place, just that something made the hair on the back of her neck raise up at the sight of him.

The other man was fat, shorter than James which was an accomplishment in itself as her father was five foot five. (In the books it had been theorized Harry was short due to malnutrition and while she imagined it didn't help, she had a feeling in this life she'd just be as tall as her dad) He had a round face, and as he smiled she spotted that he had two buck teeth just like she had when she was a kid in her old life. His hair was a pure blond, the shade that made her think would be the envy of every popular girl ever. He looked excited, his fingers twitching in a familiar way she would do when she was happy about something but trying not to stim. Whoever this was they seemed really excited to see her dad.

Then the blind folds were taken off, both men looking confused, and disoriented for a split second, cross eyed before everything seemed to settle.

""That's bloody weird,"" The taller man said, his dark green eyes striking in the low light. ""Hey Pete, you think our mum's felt like this when we had to lead them to diagon alley? Standing in a building they knew didn't look right.""

Emory's stomach dropped  at the name, her head whipping towards, 'Pete.' Oh god it was Peter and Remus. How could she be so dense!? Who else would her dad be so happy to see besides them!? What the fuck where they doing here!? Was this canon, did they come to celebrate Harry's first birthday in the books- what the fuck what the fuck whatwhahthw-

Peter only laughed, a sound that was strained, his sky blue eyes looked pained at the question. Was it his eternal guilt about what he was going to do this October eating him up? The smile on his lips looked very fake proving to her one thing. Just because Peter wasn't some ugly slimy thing from the abyss he still was the traitor of this story. Though what was he doing with a mom that was a muggle? Didn't his wiki page say he was a pureblood?

""Remus,"" Sirius scowled, hissing lowly not looking too happy at the question aimed at their friend. She wouldn't know why, it was a valid question. A look of realization seemed to dawn on Remus face, before replaced with guilt- whatever it was about well it didn't matter this guy was a traitor he didn't deserve sympathy.

Peter hadn't answered, which she would've found suspicious if not for the fact that he wasn't given the chance too. Instead having been practically bulldozed over by her father as he picked the smaller man up, and hugged him with such strength he squeaked! He sounded just like a rat too, the high pitch squeaks she was familiar with on cute rat compilations as they would hop around and play together.

Her face was twitching, she could feel something foreign building up in her throat. An undercurrent of fear welled up inside of her as she thought she was about to throw up.  it's not as if it was new, she had tried to get into the habit of throwing up her food after it was spelled into her but it was exhausting to do. As she opened her mouth, a reaction born of being used to voicing that something was wrong instead of her puking, crying or anything else she had been use to doing.

Emory, for the first time in this life laughed.

She laughed, a baby squeal that filled up the living room, and with that one simple action suddenly the room had gone to chaos.

A jump into Peter's mind shows that there is more than meets the eye with everyone's most hated character. Emory on the other hand finally caves in, and lets herself have fun, just for once... It doesn't go as planned, of course, as if anything ever does.

'Is it pathetic of me to be flattered by a baby?'

Was the first question on Peter's mind, having felt his face go red in embarrassment as he was the center of attention. He tried to pass it off as fully James- he never liked the spotlight in the first place it made him anxious. But, it seemed his best mate wasn't having any of it, claiming that Harry had been watching him. He was right too. Even now It wasn't hard to notice the baby's eyes planted firmly upon him watching him with eyes that mirrored Lily's own green. 

He didn't know how to treat babies, and had never seen one or held one really. He especially didn't get to hold Harry. He didn't hold it against James or Lil's though, maybe he would've if they had let everyone else have a go, but those two where fiercely protective over their new born son especially when news had gotten back that he was ill.

He thought about asking his mum how she took care of him, and made sure he stayed alive. He knew he was a sickly baby too, had almost died a few times before he was even walking and talking. Then again he didn't want to bring up bad memories for her, he knew she wasn't doing well now that he didn't live in the house with her. He didn't want to cause her more pain by showing up accidentally while his father was around. He just wished she would move out with him, he had cried, and sworn he could protect her from their father. She didn't believe him, of course. He was little baby Peter, weak, helpless to do anything, his only worth being a distraction. He was the protected, never the protector.

He wondered what Marlene would think, seeing him like this? The familiar worry for a girl who- at one time was a crush and another time he thought the only other friend he had besides the marauders. He wasn't sure if she thought they were friends, but he liked her and after that talk in the bar he had started to talk to her more growing closer, until that attack on her family that left her in a coma. There was something that niggled at the back of his brain, something that made him frown but he didn't know what it was. A memory? A feeling- something deeply important which made his gut twist. He shook his head to shoo away the more negative thoughts that tried to worm their way in and ruin the moment. He watched Harry, a familiar warmth welling up inside of his chest. He was still laughing, the baby's body shaking with the force of it. James was openly sobbing, his grin so wide that he swore it would've cracked his face. He had fallen to the floor upon his knees, rubbing his face against his sons in his utter joy at the sound of his baby's first laugh. He wouldn't be surprised if Harry was still laughing because of how James' five o'clock shadow was tickling his skin.

The fact that he- Peter Pettigrew had made the normally silent Harry Potter laugh filled his heart up with joy. He hadn't done anything special, just squeaked after having the air knocked out of him by James' muscular arms. His gut was feeling a bit sore as well, because as soon as  Harry laughed- James had squeezed him again, making him squeak louder this time in a little bit of distress (not that he would tell his best mate that) which only made Harry laugh harder at the sounds he made. He had quietly fallen to the background as Sirius, and James practically smothered the toddler in love. His eye had caught Remus doing the same, standing behind the couch as if he needed a physical barrier between him and Harry, making him frown at the action.

""Are you okay,"" Lily quietly asked, having walked over to him after she had smothered her son and husband in kisses. She was just as thoughtful as ever, her red rimmed eyes flicking towards his stomach. Normally he'd brush her off, tell her he was okay because this is just how things were they didn't need to worry about him too when they had Harry to take care of. 

But, tonight...

""A-Actually,"" he stammered having paused, staring at her nose to give the impression he was making eye contact. "" Um- James might've bruised me up a bit."" She frowned, her brows furrowing in worry as he laughed, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Lily it's okay I'm not going to die or anything. James has always been a bit strong.""

""Still he should be more careful,"" she muttered, clicking her tongue. ""It's okay I have some potions for that- let me go get them.""

It felt nice, not keeping everything to himself for once.

Lily came back with the potion he needed, subduing the pain and he was finally able to jump back in with the other guys. They hadn't noticed that he had pulled away, or they did and didn't say anything. They were opening gifts, and Sirius' was first,  because of course Sirius had to be first as he always was. So with a laugh he watched as James tried to get Harry to try to open the obviously broom shaped gift. The toddler didn't seem to give it a glance, having turned his head to watch him again. He laughed nervously, as Harry kept staring which- okay it was just a baby, a little kid but man with Lily's eyes he looked intense as if staring straight into his soul. 

""Haaarrryyyy,"" Sirius whined, looking like a kicked puppy at being ignored. The laughter by now had stopped and said baby had gone back to scowling, nose scrunched up as if smelling something unpleasant. Which is ridiculous, how could a baby look like it felt such distaste?

""It's okay pads he's probably still tuckered out from all the laughing.""

And without a second thought, James ripped open the gift gleefully, Lily groaning at the sight of the tiny broom.

Oh this was going to be a mess. He didn't need to be a seer to know that. He supposed the best he could do is sit back and watch the chaos unfold around him.

-

Emory decided that this was going to be a nightmare when James gleefully shouted before swinging her up, and around before plopping her bottom on the broom. The other presents she had were long forgotten in the face of the toy broom. It was by far the weirdest sensation, as if she was sitting on an invisible bike seat. Her hands subconsciously gripped the handle of the broom, having been startled only to cause her to zoom forward, much to James and Sirius' glee. The toy broom couldn't have been going that fast as James was keeping up with her but to her it felt like she was on a roller coaster. Her blood pumping, adrenaline high over taking her senses. There were whoops and hollers as she found the world around her blurring. Her hands were shaking as she kept trying to keep herself from running into anything. A yowl was heard and she barely realized she almost ran over Elvendork-

""Harry watch out!"" Lily called out trying to race after him him only to trip over the cat and that had been a shock to her system when she had first met Elvendork a few weeks ago; having the ginger pug faced cat lick her tears away Noticing a stand with a large floral vase upon it, she swerved to avoid it, managing to run straight into Remus' legs, making him yelp. Stumbling backwards it seemed the vase she had tried to avoid ended up breaking anyway, falling to the ground with a resounding crack. It shattered, sending flower petals and pieces scattering across the floor. 

She ended up flying from her broom, landing on top of Remus. It wasn't a soft landing by any means, as the man was boney as if he hadn't eaten for weeks, but it was better than landing in the ceramic pieces. She let herself lay there for a moment, her face smushed up against the man's chest, she felt him stiffen under her. His heart was beating rapidly, as if terrified that she was this close to him, was sitting on top of him. 



She hadn't noticed that he was bleeding, but Peter did as his voice seemed to cut through the chaos, stating the obvious with a pained, ""Remus, you're bleeding!""

Looking up, she met green eyes for a split second before they were over taken by a rush of gold, making her own widen at the sight. Sure she had been around magic, but she hadn't seen it in much action. There was the odd sense that this wasn't the Remus she had met a few minutes ago, something shining in his eyes. His head tilted, nose sniffing the air around her, if she didn't know he was a werewolf it wouldn't been really creepy. It seemed while James was trying to clean up the vase, and Lily had ran off to get some healing potion or whatever was used she and Remus were in a silent staring match. Peter had come over of course, but he seemed just as woefully unprepared to be faced with the task of trying to pick up a baby as he hovered over the both of them.

He looked more scared of her then she was of him! That would make two people terrified of her.

There was a rumble that caused Sirius to stiffen, her godfather had watched, apparently in amusement, that Remus was terrified of touching her. He was probably going to make the other man squirm for it- but now at a quick glance there was something different in his eyes. Her heart that had been beating in her ears, feeling like prey under his sharp gaze, roared as the man's thin arm wrapped around her body, holding her close, as if he had held a child like her a million times before so very unlike the lanky, awkward and exhausted Remus she had met before.

""Moony,"" Sirius spoke, there was no hint of warning like she expected, just surprise in her godfathers voice as Remus sat up with her in his arms. Even Peter looked on in open shock, having pulled out his wand to vanish the thin trails of blood upon his arms. The rumble grew louder, it wasn't a growl- it honestly made her think of the chuffing sound tigers would make. Still it made a shiver go up her spine reminding her of something wild. 

She watched him, staring into his eyes, almost lost in the golden pools. They were beautiful, a shimmering color that made her think of sunny days and home. Unable to help herself, she reached up, patting his scarred cheek.

Remus smiled at her, the look filled with such warmth that she hadn't realized had been missing from the green eyes she had seen. His green eyes had been filled with fear, anxiety and probably so many other things she couldn't name in one go. But, his golden eyes were just filled with love, unabashed care, a tenderness that she had mainly seen from her parents, and Sirius. The eye contact was broken as the man set his chin on top of her head, causing a confused sound to leave her. He started to rub his chin, and jaw against the top of her head, musing up the black curls she had. She continued to voice her confusion the best she could, turning only to find Sirius, whose posture looked relaxed holding a camera.

""Oh merlin look at him-,"" he snickered, the snap from the camera making her blink owlishly up at him. ""He looks like his eyes are going to pop out of his skull!"" Sirius elbowed Peter, making the other man wheeze from the suddenness of it. 

""Oi, Oi!"" James' voice came from behind Remus, with a mock scowl on his face as he loomed over them. ""You scent marking my child? He's not yours, I worked hard for him!""

""You worked hard for him,"" Lily's dry, annoyed voice made her turn to look at her as she walked in, brow raised. James sheepishly laughed while both Peter and Sirius snickered at their friend's position. ""I don't remember you carrying him for nine months. If you really want to work for it maybe we should use that spell I found to give you a chance."" 

James flustered, flapping his arms and squawking, Sirius and Peter howling as the man was left wrong footed by his own wife.

""Hello Moony,"" Lily spoke, drawing the wolf's attention to her. It had to be the wolf, Remus hadn't wanted to touch her, he looked frightened as if, if he touched her he would end up shattering her in a million pieces. She supposed wolves didn't have the same fear, able to feel the happy sound of his rumbles reverberating through his chest.

""I have a potion for you,"" she continued, having slowly crouched down to be on the same level as him. He snorted, giving her the stink eye as he held her a bit tighter then she would like.

""You can't lick your wounds you're not as flexible like this,"" Lily pointed out as if she knew what Remus/Moony was saying even though he hadn't spoken once.

She took out her wand, which was long, a bit twisted at the tip, the wood a light color as she easily pulled what little fragments Remus had gotten stuck in his arms. Then lightly she placed potion soaked bandages upon his arms which healed the cuts right up. With a light sigh, she stood up, getting Remus to stand up as well, still holding her possessivly in his arms. 

Well, quite frankly this was bizarre. She had never been held by anyone else besides her parents, and Sirius. She liked the view being in Moony's arms gave her, as even Lily, who was taller then James by many inches wasn't as tall as Moony. She felt that she was on top of the world, looking down at everyone else which reminded her of the height that she would never have in this life.

""I think that's enough excitement for today. Me and James will get changed, why don't the three of you go into the kitchen. We have everything set up-"" She cut herself off, sending a sharp glare to Sirius, ""and don't you dare touch the cake we have set up!""

Sirius raised his arms in the air in mock submission, ""Whoa Lily flower! I'm not going to ruin Harry's birthday."" She pursed her lips, rolling her eyes, before turning to Moony, placing a quick kiss to his forehead, having to stand on her tip toes to reach before going towards the stairs, James following behind her. He must have said something funny because she caught the sound of laughter, the sound fading as the three other men settled down in the kitchen. 

""Moony, you're going to have to set Harry in his highchair,"" Sirius pointed out though she's not sure if he did it because he wanted him to do it, or to gain the annoyed huff from the wolf.

""It's been a really long time since we've seen you like this, how are you,"" Peter asked, his fingernail drawing patterns in the warm wood of the kitchen table. The man watched Moony in deep interest, his eyes flicking to her every few seconds.

Emory wasn't even sure if Moony could speak, so when he did she was left shocked again. (Annoyingly enough Sirius had taken another picture, and this one would show both her shock and Remus/Moony's' annoyance)

""Difficult."" Moony' voice was worn, as if the man hadn't talked for years, a low gravelly sound. ""Remus is a stupid man."" 

""Well, never say that anyone's perfect,"" Peter sighed shaking his head, hiding his face in his hand.

""Remus is a fool,"" the wolf went on insulting his other half His host?, seemingly ignoring Peter's words or using this as a way to add onto them. ""He is a fool that listens to those not of pack. I mourn our times apart, he claims this is better for us all. My soul aches."" 

Suddenly the mood turned somber, both Peter and Sirius glancing at each other, before looking to Moony. They both looked like they wanted to say something, or ask the wolf something but weren't sure if they should. Moony seemed to take control, adding on, ""Old man has claimed Remus' work is better for-""

Suddenly, Moony's head started twitching frantically, hitting the side of his shoulder repeatedly as if having an eternal battle with himself. She was quickly whisked away into Peter's arms, and maybe if she wasn't terrified of the thought that Remus was having a seizure she might've bitten his hand. Instead she watched as his golden eyes dimmed the green fighting control over the other as he was flailing into his seat. Sirius raced forward, holding Remus down the best he could whisper hissing, ""don't- don't do this Remus, come on.""

Peter turned her body away from what was happening, keeping her from seeing anything more. She heard the way the chair shook, Sirius hissing, Lily and James racing down dressed in new clothes that she knew matched her own in ways colors that were a bit more muted, yet still so beautiful. 'Is that what a sari is,' her brain silently commented even as the tensions in the room grew higher.

A snarl was ripped from Remus' throat, the booming voice of Moony's last resolve screaming out, ""YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO HIDE REMUS LUPIN THEY ARE PACK."" 

Then, all was silent.

She shouldn't be surprised when Remus came too; he looked furious, but along with that terrified of himself. His hands were shaking as he glared at both Peter and Sirius, Peter withered from the look, yet even as he shrunk he hid her with him, instead of leaving her in the path of the full glare while Sirius' eyes gained a hardened light to them. Even Lily and James could only watch as Sirius confronted Remus as if in shock of what was happening right before their eyes. 

""It's Dumbledore, isn't it.""

Remus didn't answer, instead standing on shaking legs, his nostrils flaring. ""That is none of your business,"" he hissed starting to back out from the room. 

Sirius chased after him like a dog with a bone. ""It is our business! He's using you to spy on the wolf packs isn't he!?""

Emory blinked, feeling guilt twist her stomach. She had forgotten that all this time Remus was out there, following the headmaster's orders. She could only wonder how it felt, doing something that terrified you, but feeling the need you had too.

""Just because he gave you a place at school doesn't mean you owe him anything,"" Sirius continued unknowingly echoing Emory's own thoughts, stalking forward,  even as Remus looked like the other man had slapped him with a fish. ""He treated you with basic human decency! You deserved to go to school no matter what- just because he asked you to run a fools mission doesn't mean you have to- do you think James was stupid enough to give Dumbldore his cloak? Or, even let the man know about it!""

Emory didn't have time to think about the implications of Dumbldore not having James cloak, wide and wary eyes turning from Sirius to Remus whoes face twisted into something sour at being called a fool, lips curled into a snarl, ""You don't get to call me a fool, not after you-""

""BOYS!""

Both men jumped as Lily flicked her wand, freezing the two of them in place. She looked thunderous, so much so, both men seemed to wilt in front of the force of her. 

""If you are going to fight,"" she spoke in mock sweetness, a sharp smile that spoke of eternal agony if they didn't listen. ""You will take it to a different room and ward it with silent charms, or I will kick you both out of the house to fight in the back yard like the dogs you are! This is Harry's first birthday party, and I won't let you two ruin it with your bickering!""

Her temper was rising, Emory could feel it, crackling around the kitchen, it tasted electric, and sharp, sharp enough to cut her finger if she barely grazed it. Both men still looked ready to go at each others necks, but they seemed to have the decency to take Lily's words to heart practically nipping at each other's heels with whisper hisses and sharp growls. 

Lily's shoulders slumped as she fell into the seat that Remus use to occupy, James sitting next to her with an arm around her shoulder. She didn't realize it at first, but Lily was crying, the tears rolling down her cheeks as they fell upon the table. Emory held her breath, glancing up to find that Peter looked just as tired, and upset by everything that was happening.

""I just wanted us to be a family- a happy family for one fucking day,"" she cried, her accent sounding strange, slurred, thickening into something else before she seemed to force it down. ""I baked a cake, I managed to message the others of the order, and they sent their own gifts, we put this all together yet still-""

""I don't think it's ruined,"" Peter whispered, looking down at her. ""I mean, Harry seems fine? A bit confused maybe, but he hasn't cried once, and isn't that something?""

Emory looked from Peter, to Lily, and James who, looked surprised. She didn't cry that much did she? Not enough to be a shock like this, should she feel offended?

""Oh,"" Lily's voice cracked her watery eyes turning to look at her. ""Oh- Peter you're right he hasn't cried even once today.""

""Yeah, maybe he passed the water works onto you, and James, you both seemed to be crying a lot today,"" Peter joked, the teasing sounding gentle to her ears. How could a man that seemed so content be a traitor? How good of an actor did he have to be, to be able to say this to her parents, to have the gall to hold her gently as if he gave a damn about any of them. 

The three sat in silence, Lily having done her best to clean up her face as James kissed her temple. Lily had rested her head against James shoulder as the three of them tried to let the emotions of today go through them. The cake, which she hadn't noticed at first was covered with white frosting and tons of rainbow sprinkles. She supposed it was more for the adults then for her, since she never had a good track record with food in this new life. She closed her eyes, listening as the three talked quietly about this and that. James mentioning how good of a Quidditch player she was going to be when she was older; while Peter talked about the McKinnon's and apparently the lone survivor Marlene an how when she first woke up from the magical induced coma she had been put under the week before she had cursed that she'd missed Harry's birthday at this rate before passing out again.

""You know, before this old Bathilda had talked about showing up for Harry's birthday and us having a quiet birthday tea. Of course we declined since all of you would be coming over today, but I feel a bit guilty. She's such a sweet woman, always asks after Harry's health and the like.""

The whole time that Lily was talking about a name she barely recognized, she kept turning the idea over and over in her head. Peter had set her on the highchair, as he had cut the cake and handed everyone a nice big slice, even she had gotten one though none seemed to think she would eat it.

""Mummy,"" Emory began slowly, her voice sounding slurred. Lily's head jerk up, staring at her with an open mouth while her dad's eyes seemed to pop from his head. She's sure if her, and James weren't already sitting down they would've fallen on their asses, blown away by the next words she spoke. ""Da, I love you,"" she finished feeling that given how stressful their day was that this was the least that she could do for Lily, for the both of them. Sure she wouldn't get to have the fun of saying her first word was fuck, but this mattered much more then her childish wants to mess with the adults around her.

""It looks like I was wrong,"" James whispered, sounding choked up. ""It looks like our little Harry had to prove us wrong. He didn't have his first word, he had to make it his first sentence!""

Lily laughed, the sound watery to her ears but she didn't care, both of them finally looked their age, joyful as they hugged each other.

Emory's stomach grumbled, making all the adults in the room laugh. With a smile of her own, she reached forward much to everyone's shock, and grabbed the cake before thrusting a bit of it into her mouth.

""Wait, that's dark chocolate! Peter stop him before-""

But it was too late, she didn't care if she got sick from this. Quickly she grabbed fistfuls of the delicious cake, gleefully stuffing it into her mouth, even though she had ate to much to the point she'd probably choke. Everyone had jerked up from their seats, sending the camera that Sirius had left behind falling to the floor, a click went off as a picture was taken which they would find later to be of their legs rushing forward much to the groups collective amusement it soon would become one of the favorites in the album."

James Potter observed, looking at the shimmering, pearly white potion in his friend's cauldron.

Sirius Black shook his head.  ""Couldn't be.  I can't smell anything.""  He leaned in closer to his potion and inhaled.  The odd thing was, he shouldn't have needed to.  His textbook said Amortentia was incredibly aromatic, not to mention how much his sense of smell had heightened since fifth-year.  There was a hint of...some sort of spice?  But at this point Sirius was pretty sure he was just imagining it.

He was interrupted from his thoughts when he felt James' hand still his.  ""Don't over stir, mate.  Dad says you've gotta figure out what you did wrong before you do anything else.""

James' dad, Fleamont Potter was a somewhat famous potioneer, known for inventing Sleakeazy's hair potion.  He was a great person, and Sirius had grown to see him as a second father (or perhaps a first father, to tell the truth) ever since he'd moved in with James when they were both sixteen.  He'd rather not think about it at the moment, but the short story was that his so-called ""home"" had simply gotten to be too much.

""Hey, Lily!"" James exclaimed, waving at where Lily Evans, the potions prodigy of their year, was working with their other friend, Remus Lupin.  She looked up, and James grinned at her.  ""Can you help us?""  Lily nodded, her face slightly red, and began walking over.

""I reckon she likes you.""  Sirius observed, having noticed her blush.

""Nah, she doesn't.""  James replied, slightly dejected.  ""We're friends now.  It's fine.  Better even.  I'm over her, really mate.""

Sirius hmm-ed in response, glancing at James cauldron.  He didn't have to speculate too much on what James may or may not have smelled, but really, he was too fed up with this potion to care much for James' love life just then.  He was flipping through his potions book, trying to find where he went wrong, when Lily approached them.

""What do you boys need help with?"" she asked, leaning against the front of their table.

""Sirius can't smell anything,"" James said nodding at Sirius and his cauldron.

Lily scrutinized the potion.  ""It seems to be the right shade...you added all your silver powder, yes?""  Sirius nodded, and gestured at his empty mortar.  ""Okaaay.""  Lily bit her lip, thinking.  ""Did you add two many rose petals?  They're very fragrant, too many, and all you'd be able to smell is rose.""

""But I can't smell rose,"" Sirius pointed out.  ""I can't smell anything.""

""You're right...it's awfully odd.""  She inhaled.  ""No, you definitely did it right.  It smells like..."" she trailed off, and Sirius saw her eyes flit to James for half a second, before returning to look at Sirius.  She cleared her throat, and continued.  ""It smells how it usually does for me.  James?""

""What?""  James asked, surprised at being addressed.

""Does it smell normal to you?"" she asked.  ""Sirius' potion?""

James inhaled.  ""Oh, yeah, definitely.  Smells like...y'know, the usual.""  He blushed, and tried to avoid staring at Lily.

Oh my Godric, do they have to do this now? Sirius thought.  He didn't say that, though. ""So, what's wrong, then?"" he asked instead.  ""Why can't I smell anything?""

Lily chewed on her lip, and looked around, thinking.  ""You know what it could be?  You could be too close to the ingredients.  They can smell fairly strong.  I mean...the potion should be stronger, but I suppose it's possible, theoretically, that one who disliked strong smells would have a less stronger smelling Amortentia, because, well obviously it's meant to smell like what attracts or comforts you, and it would be quite counterproductive of it to be overly fragrant when one--""

""Lily!"" Sirius interrupted.  ""Slow down there.  The ingredients might be too potent, you said?""

""Yes, I suppose.  I mean, it's all I can think of."" she replied.

""Brill.""  His dog senses must have picked up on the ingredients instead of the potion.  That had to be it...right?  ""So, what do I do?""

Lily thought about it for all of two seconds before grabbing his cauldron, and walking to Slughorn's desk.  Sirius turned to James, who just shrugged.  He reluctantly followed her to the front of the room.

""Professor, Sirius was having trouble smelling his potion.  I figure it might have to do with how strong the ingredients can smell, especially back in that corner.  Now, I know you don't want the potions leaving the classroom, and with good reason, of course,"" Lily was surprisingly good at this.  She was fairly convincing l, and of course it didn't hurt that she was Slughorn's favorite.  ""But really, I'd be happy to go with him, and keep an eye on things.""  At this point Lily adjusted her sweater ever-so-slightly that her head girl badge got the light.  Not a bad touch, if Sirius did say so.

""Why of course, of course!"" Slughorn declared, beaming at Lily.  ""Go on, I trust you, of course, Lily.""  Lily smiled back at him, before discreetly elbowing Sirius in the chest.

""Ow...um, thank you, sir."" he muttered.

Lily turned around to begin walking out of the room, and Sirius saw her rolling her eyes.  While Slughorn was shouting that ""of course, of course, anytime, young boy"" or something like that, Sirius whispered to Lily ""That was smooth.  You'd make a wonderful Marauder.""

Lily scoffed, ""It was hardly breaking the rules, Sirius.""

""Still,"" Sirius muttered, ""we can always use a teacher's pet.""  He nodded his head at Remus as they walked past his desk.  Lily raised her eyebrows.  ""Well, that and he's our friend.  But so are you, Evans.""

""Right,"" Lily said, holding the door open, and handing him his cauldron as he walked past.  He leaned in and inhaled.  He could definitely smell it, but it was decidedly still the smell of the potions room.  ""Well?"" Lily asked, stepping out of the doorway and into the corridor.

""It just smells like the classroom..."" he inhaled, and caught a strong whiff of the spices he thought he had noticed earlier, though they were more recognizable now, ""and...masala"" he finished.  ""Spices."" he added at Lily's confused expression.

""What kind of spices?"" Lily asked.

""All sorts, I guess.  Saffron, cardamom, turmeric.  They're very...fragrant.""  Sirius realized where he'd smelled these before.  ""They're the sort that Mu...Mrs. Potter uses.""  Then, Sirius suddenly realized something.  Of course, he thought, that's why I couldn't smell it in the classroom.  ""Thanks, Lily!  You're the best!""

Lily looked at him, confused.  ""I...okay?  What did you smell?""  

Sirius didn't really want to tell her.  Lily knew he lived with James, but he didn't want to get into it.  He just smirked at her.  ""What did you smell?""

Lily flushed bright red.  ""Well, I...it's complicated.  Sort of...private actually, I'd rather not..."" she stammered, ""you don't have to tell me, if yours is private, I just...""

""Relax, Evans, it's not a big deal.  Thanks again!""  Sirius said, walking past her back into the classroom, where Slughorn was walking around assigning grades to students' potions.  Lily followed him in, and they went to their desks.  He sat down at his table next to James, and put his cauldron in front of him.

""Well?"" James asked, ""Did it work?""

""Yeah, just fine,"" Sirius muttered, nervously tracing a circle on the table with his finger.  He found the whole situation rather embarrassing.  Sure, James would be cool about it, but...well, he just wasn't great at these sorts of conversations.  Feelings-conversations.  

""So?  What was it?  What did you smell?  Why wasn't it working here?"" James grinned at him, ""Don't tell me your Amortentia smells like potions ingredients!""  Sirius blushed, and kept his eyes focused on the table.  James noticed his sudden silence and asked, ""Does it?  Smell like potions ingredients?""  Sirius looked at him and nodded.  This was positively mortifying.  ""Oh, Pads.  Mate, I didn't mean to...I mean, that's okay.  I just...I never thought you liked the class much, is all.  It's fine, really, I don't care one way or another.""

Sirius shook his head.  ""It's not the class, it- it was more like...your dad's brewing room.  And...your mum's masala, I...it smelled like...your house.""  He didn't really know what else to say, so he kept his head down.

Their conversation paused as Slughorn came over to grade their potions, before vanishing them with his wand.  He assigned the homework (2 feet on the purpose of the ingredients in Amortentia) and dismissed the class.

""Really?"" James asked, as they packed up their stuff.  ""My house?""

Sirius nodded.  ""Yeah, I guess cause...y'know, you guys are like family to me, and I guess that...well, it's more of a home than Grimmauld was, and...I don't know Prongs, I'm not good at...this sorta thing.  You know that.""

James laughed.  ""It's okay, mate.""

They headed out of the classroom with Remus and Peter, before splitting off to go to muggle studies.

They were about halfway there when James brought it up again.  ""I'm glad you moved in with us."" he said, suddenly.  Sirius turned to look at his best friend.  ""I mean, it's been nice having you around, of course, but really...I'm just glad you got out of that house.""

""Thanks,"" Sirius muttered, looking down at his shoes.

He didn't like talking about Grimmauld, much.  He missed his brother, even if Regulus clearly didn't miss him.  At least he knew his brother was safe, Regulus had never made Mother angry the way Sirius did.

He looked back up at James.  ""Thanks for saying that.  And for...being my friend, and taking me in, and...not laughing at me, with the potion.""

""Padfoot,"" James said, smiling and shaking his head.  ""You're my best mate, you know I'd do anything for you.""  James stopped walking, and pulled Sirius into a hug.  They stood like that, for  a brief moment, before remembering they were, in fact, in the middle of the corridor.

""And I'd never laugh at you,"" James added, as they continued on their way.  Sirius raised his eyebrows.  ""Okay, sometimes,"" James admitted, ""but it's usually justified.""

""Git,"" Sirius muttered, reaching over to mess up James' hair.  James ducked out of the way, and stuck his tongue out.  ""Whatever, your hair doesn't need my help to look like a bird's nest,"" Sirius mocked.

""Hey!"""

Hyacinth Potter, Hadrian Potter, Harriet Potter; the list goes on and on and on until the close.

Except here. 

Here, just before Harika Potter sets down that Elder Wand, she hesitates. Her fingers trace the worn wood and it warms like sunshine on a bright Hogwarts morning. Home, it says. 


Wouldn't you like a home, Hari?


Hari may be a golden lion, true, but her heart is a hungry thing. A ambitious thing. A Slytherin thing. 

And like all Slytherin things, her heart knew how to recognize an offer when it saw one. 

Just one spell, Hari. Just one. 

Maybe she would have accepted, her hunger-bitten insides ached with the possibility, but-

Dumbledore peered over those glasses at her frozen form, and Hari knew well enough that she never could. 

The wand barely made a sound when it touched the desk, but it may as well been a particularly well-aimed bombarda with how Hari's body shook without that small weight in her hands. 

She took three steps towards the door, and her hands quivered with want. It was so close- 

But no. Harika Potter had more power than she knew what to do with already. She needed no more. 


But oh, silly girl, who said the only thing it gave was power?

Lily set a cloth bag full of reusable food containers on Remus' desk in the campus library. The werewolf had originally taken the job as a way of earning money while getting his degree. In less than a week of working there, that had changed. Remus loved working in the library, even when his shifts were unexpectedly extended, and he needed meals brought to him. The only hard limit he put on his hours was keeping the Sabbath. Not seeing Remus in the immediate vicinity of his desk, Lily settled in his chair.

She pulled out her laptop. No matter how adorable Tony was, she really regretted letting him code unattended while sleep deprived and high on coffee. Honestly, she could see why his first projects couldn't progress pass beyond the understanding of a young child. The code base was a brilliant mess. The weaving of the algorithms and variables was beautiful. She couldn't wait for Tony to officially move to Cambridge as planned so that she could meet Dummy and U finally.

She had a feeling that Tony's boys would fit right in with the Marauders.

""I haven't heard you sigh like that since Marlene broke up with you and James,"" Remus commented as he dropped a stack of books beside the bag of food. He immediately began shuffling through the bag containing his dinner. The smell of warm spices wafted up from the containers as he opened them. ""Oh, now I know something is up. Beef curry and Gobi Manchurian?"" His eyes were gold when he looked up at her. ""What are you up to, Lils?""

""I need you to keep Sirius occupied and out of the flat tomorrow afternoon,"" Lily announced. At his stern look, she pouted. ""You should be nice to me. I made beef curry for you, Remus! I cooked beef in our kitchen.""

""Yes,"" Remus agreed, ""and that is why I'm suspicious. You, a humble wife--"" Lily snorted. Remus gave a crooked smile that made her want to curl around him until he relaxed enough for it to be a full grin. ""--of a proper Hindu cooked beef in the same kitchen where you prepare his meals. You also cooked cauliflower, despite how much you hate the way it smells. So, what are you up to, Dr. Evans Potter?""

""James and I are having my lab partner over for lunch,"" she answered. Remus gestured with his fork for her to continue before taking a bit. She grinned triumphantly at the mistake. ""We're hoping that Tony will be dessert.""

Remus choked on his nasty cauliflower. Serves him right. He should have known better than to eat or drink anything when she or Sirius were talking. They always managed to say something shocking. He managed to swallow the bite.

""You're evil,"" Remus accused without any real venom. ""I don't even know why I put up with you.""

""Who else would listen to you bellyache about your time of the month when you've chased away James and Peter and Sirius has gone to resupply your chocolate stash?""

""I don't--""

""Oh, but you do,"" she interrupted. ""You really do bellyache. But it's okay because your entire body is attempting to turn itself inside out."" She saved her progress proofing Tony's addition to their code. Then she closed and packed away her laptop. ""I do need to get back to the flat. Sirius had been trying to convince James to let him try baking again.""

""Yes,"" Remus agreed hurriedly, ""get back to the flat. The last thing we need is another flight of gingerbread hippogriffs tracking over the bathroom for a week. Worse than the self-replicating rubber ducks.""

""I thought we agreed to not talk about the Ducks,"" Lily whined. She gave his cheek a kiss as she rose, leaving behind the faintest impression of her violet lipstick. ""Take care, love. Don't get lost in your books and forget to make it home before curfew. You know how prissy campus security can be, even if you are rocking the whole librarian look.""

""Yes, Mom,"" Remus replied, only a bit snarky. He knew as well as she did that campus security was already leery about their group because of the visible diversity they had between them. They really didn't need to give them any more excuses to harass any of them. ""I'll have you know that Sirius likes my librarian look.""

""That's because he has taste,"" Lily said. ""I would totally go for it, too, if it didn't feel so damn incestuous to James.""

""It is nice to know that you and James have some limits."" Remus stabbed a cube of beef from his curry. ""Goodness knows how often one of you are interrupting me and Sirius.""

""Please, like we haven't already seen Sirius naked,"" Lily quipped as she began to walk away. Remus sputtered behind her a few times before finally getting a reply together.

""That's not fair! All of Gryffindor has seen Sirius naked!""

She gave him a quick wink over her shoulder and just kept walking."

Upon shutting the door behind them, they collapsed, almost in unison, on the armchairs near the barren fireplace.""That was amazing!"" Hermione exclaimed, still laughing as she wiped some pigment from above her eyes, only succeeding in smudging it further.""I'm surprised you're not more concerned about us getting colour on the furniture, Hermione,"" Ron said.""Oh, give it a rest, Ronald, I'm tired,"" she replied, grinning.Harry smiled, leaning back in his own seat with a feeling of satisfaction warmly spreading through him. It had been his first time attending Holi festivities since uncovering more about his lineage.He could just imagine his parents excitedly looking on as he realized his racial background and cheering for him when he decided to immerse himself in it. To think there had been an entire Indian Wizarding community in London, waiting with open arms to greet him and introduce him to the culture he'd missed out on growing up - it was still unfathomable to Harry. It made sense that this was soon followed by his eventual decision to convert to Hinduism, and introducing his partners to the culture made sense after that.""The bonfire was beautiful, too,"" Ron added. His face was very amusingly covered in mainly yellow. ""What was it called, again, Harry?""Before Harry could reply, Hermione had already jumped in. ""Holika Dahan,"" she said, waving a red-and-green hand. ""Honestly, Ron, don't you remember anything -""""Look I just found out about all this stuff two days ago -""""And so did I, Ron, we learned about them at the same time -""""Have you ever thought, Hermione, that maybe not everyone has a brain that could double as a sponge -""""Well have you ever thought, Ron, that you come up with the stupidest excuses for your terrible memory -""""Ugh, Harry, back me up here, will you? You have a normal brain like mine -""""I'm the one appreciating Harry's religious festivals, Ron, so clearly he sides with me -""Harry grinned as he watched Hermione and Ron bicker back and forth. Just a few years ago, he'd been so jealous of their romantic relationship. It had been such a confusing time for him, as he couldn't figure out which one of his best friends he was jealous of. When they'd come forward to him and asked if he'd like to be a part of their relationship, it all clicked into place, and the rest was history.Now, he couldn't imagine living his life any other way. It'd been strange, at first, since he was so used to being the third wheel, but Hermione and Ron had done everything they could to make him feel included. They held hands with him under the table at dinner, shared giant mugs of butterbeer, and lay intertwined on sofas and floors. They'd broken the news to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and aside from a few awkward questions from Mr. Weasley, it had gone well. They'd told some close friends and were met with congratulations and acceptance. To be honest, Harry had never felt so loved in all his life.Also, the sex was fantastic. Whether they were pleasuring each other and keeping their mouths and tongues busy, or he and Ron were both buried in Hermione, kissing over her shoulder to the sound of her moans and cries, it was mind-blowing. It was something that had also taken some time for Harry to fully adjust to, but he wasn't complaining - and he suspected neither of his partners minded.Harry came back to the present and found that Hermione and Ron were still going at it."" - if you listened to anything I'd been saying, Ron, you wouldn't have concluded that -""""All I'm saying is, it's unreasonable to expect that I'd ever -""""Ron, you're being ridiculous! Don't you think so, Harry?"" Hermione looked over at him, and he frustrated frown dropped away into an expression of exasperation. ""Why are you smiling?""Harry shook his head, unable to get the grin off his face. ""It's nothing.""""You didn't have too much of that funny spiced milk drink, did you?"" Ron asked, scrunching his nose. A few creases appeared in the dried-up coloured water staining it. ""It really was quite potent -""""He only had one small cup of it, Ron,"" Hermione replied. ""And it's called Bhang Ki Thandai.""""Now, how was I supposed to remember that?"" Ron grumbled.""It's literally thandai with bhang in it,"" Hermione said sternly.""What the bloody hell do those words even mean?""""Thandai is a cold drink made with spices, almonds, and other things like fennel and watermelon seeds. And bhang is cannabis. Seriously, Ron, Harry told you all of this yesterday.""""It's just a lot of ingredients to remember!"" Ron snapped. He paused, then went red, and Harry vaguely wondered if he'd turn orange due to the yellow splashed over him. ""Wait, cannabis? As in, weed?""""Yes, Ron,"" Hermione said. ""Don't tell me you're going to be immature about this. It's a very common drink during festivals like these.""""My prior need for a sobering potion suddenly makes so much more sense now,"" Ron groaned. He turned to Harry. ""Why didn't you remind me of what was in it?"" He narrowed his eyes when he caught sight of Harry's still gleeful smile. ""Just why do you look so pleased with yourself?""""I was asking the same thing,"" Hermione said.The two suddenly turned on Harry, their argument already forgotten. He couldn't help the fact that his grin was impossible to get rid of, even if it was starting to hurt his blue-dyed cheeks.""You two are great,"" Harry said, smiling. ""Just fantastic."" The softening of Hermione's gaze and the pink colour rising to Ron's ears met his words. ""And I've just thought of a great way to have a private afterparty...""A few minutes later, in their bedroom, that private afterparty was in full swing, and as Hermione took him into his mouth while Ron filled her, Harry couldn't think of any place he would rather be."

She feels petty right afterward, but not petty enough to put them back. After all the crap he's put her through, he deserves some suffering in his life, and what better way to make that obvious to him than by bringing cabbages home? It is a plan for the ages, and boy, is she going to win this argument. 

She'd decided to go grocery shopping partly in order to cool down, and partly because they'd nearly run out of vegetables that afternoon, but by the time the cashier's finished ringing everything up, she's worked herself up into full-blown righteous indignation. She loves her husband, she really does, but he's so good at pushing all the wrong buttons sometimes. It had started out so small, so silly-- Janardhan had made Hari's bath too warm and he'd screamed for an hour and, of course, she'd had to fix it.

And that was the way things always were-- he would screw up and she would have to clean up his messes.  Sometimes I feel like I've married a child!, she'd shouted, and the conversation devolved from there. They'd spent an hour screaming insults and accusations at each other, until finally she'd stormed out of the house, too angry to think straight. She'd heard a faint ""I love you"" yelled at her, as she slammed the door shut, but she'd chosen to ignore it then, and was choosing to ignore it now. She knows just what to say to him now, and so she Apparates back to the house, bag full of cabbage heads in hand, ready to deliver the perfect comeback and end this once and for all, and-- the top floor is gone.

At first, it seems too absurd to be true, and she wonders if her husband's bad eyesight has become contagious.  How did he screw up feeding Hari this badly? , she thinks, a familiar exasperated expression settling onto her face as she wonders what she'll say to him this time, but then she really thinks about it for a second.

Oh God,  she thinks, the cold iron fist of fear grabbing her heart and squeezing it tight. The top floor is gone. 

And then she's racing through the gaping hole that used to be her front door and up splintered stairs, distantly noting an overturned chair here, a scorch mark there.

Within seconds, she's standing inside the nursery doorway. The first thing she sees are Janardhan's glasses, lying broken on the floor. The lenses are cracked, spiderwebs of lines weaving their way through the glass, and-- and---

Her husband, her Janardhan, is lying far too still beside them.

His whole body is strangely limp, his whole posture so  off,  and he's staring emptily up at the ceiling in a way that is so very  wrong  that, for a second, she thinks he's pulled the worst prank ever. ""How dare you!"" She wants to yell, and watch his features come alive again, a sheepish grin lighting up his face. But she knows better.

The familiar mischievous glint in his hazel eyes is gone, as if it's been sucked right out of him by a Dementor, and Lalitha's gaze travels from his still chest, up his motionless arm, and down the fingers reaching desperately through the bars of Hari's crib, hoping that the lack of noise from it doesn't mean what she thinks. Her heart climbs up into her throat as she desperately hopes that her son, her beautiful, darling, loud little boy, is just sleeping, too caught up in some soft, wild dream to wake at the sound of someone entering his room.

But she's watched him sleep so much, over the past fifteen months, memorized the soft flutter of his eyelashes against his chubby brown cheeks and the way his tiny chest rises and fall evenly with every breath and something is wrong because he's so still. Her baby, her Hari is defined by motion, by the way he climbs up and down the stairs carefully and runs wild through the kitchen. He's not moving. He's too still, and he's not breathing, and neither is Janardhan. They're not breathing. They're  not breathing .

Lalitha wants to scream but she can't, she can't even breathe. It feels like she's forgotten how, to match her husband and her son. She thinks of Janardhan in his last moments, reaching out to his son,  their son. She wonders if he was thinking about her, if he knew how much she loved him, how much she wished that had been the last thing she'd said to him. It was the last thing he'd said to her-- he'd said that he loved her, as the last thing, and what had she done? Her hands are shaking, and she can hardly feel her face, because it feels like there is some awful buzzing building beneath her skin.

In the midst of the panic, she notices one thing-- as always, Hari looks just like his father.

 She doesn't know which is worse-- that first realization, or the ones she has a hundred times every day, when she makes plans around the two people-shaped holes in her life. It would be so much better, she thinks, if she carried that around with her constantly, numbing her to the pain.

It's so sudden when it happens. She'll glance in a shop window and think about how Hari would love that spinning top, how that shirt would bring out Janardhan's eyes, and then when she remembers, it's always as bad as that first time.

When she thinks about them now, she doesn't let herself think Janardhan and Hari, because somehow, that is all the more painful. They were James and Harry to the Marauders, to the world, and when she mourns them as James and Harry it feels as though she is sharing this burden of grief, she doesn't have to carry it all alone. But Janardhan and Hari were solely hers, her boys, the loves of her life, and they can only be mourned by her-- and right now she is not strong enough to bear that weight.

It makes everything a little more endurable, for them to be James and Harry and her to be Lily. It's an act she can put on, just a part to play, and she doesn't have to think too hard about everything she lost.

People visit a little, in the beginning. Offering consolations and trite words of wisdom alike, things like  It'll get better  and  Everything will be alright  . What's even worse is the things they don't say, the spaces between their words when all she can hear is  Thank god it wasn't me.  People fear death, and though she is alive she is as steeped in death and sorrow as one can be.

There are really only two people she even wants to see, right now. That is not true-- there are four people, counting the two people she actually most wants to see, but can't. But the two who she can feel just as far away, these days. She cannot bring herself to take that first step, to see them, because more than the living, it would be the empty spaces that would stand out, the sentences left unfinished, the tenses that would start out present before changing to past.

There would be too much silence, Lily thinks, and shelves the issue. Besides, they were his friends first, anyway.

So when Severus Snape shows up at her doorstep, it is almost the last thing she is expecting. 

He is there when she opens the door to grab the morning paper, his hand poised to knock at the door, and when she registers his existence she almost closes the door in his face. She isn't quite sure, in the end, why she doesn't-- the lack of human interaction she's had recently, perhaps, combined with her rather unstable emotional state, along with numerous other reasons-- but, before she really has a handle on the situation, he's in her sitting room with one of her terrible cups of chai James always used to tease her about.

The silence between them is thick, and Lily doesn't have the energy to break it. There has been too much said between them, throughout the years, or maybe not enough. He's always been good at breaking things and she's always been the one to fix them, but for once she doesn't want to.

""How have you been?"" he asks finally, and she has to fight not to laugh at the absurdity of this question.  I've lost everyone in this world who I loved the most,  she wants to say.  I had to cremate my baby son. Can you imagine outliving your son, Severus? How do you think I am? But she is too drained, too tired to say any of what she actually feels.

So instead, she gives him a mirthless smile. ""Not very well.""

This seems to make him realize the foolishness of his question, and he breaks eye contact and looks down. ""Yes, o-of course,"" he stutters. ""I'm sorry about them."" 

And, all of a sudden, Lily is furious because Severus had  hated her husband, and he'd never even met Harry. How dare he say these meaningless words to her?"" 

""Don't pretend like you're actually sorry,"" she snaps, and her voice is whip-sharp. Sev- Snape flinches like he's been slapped across the face. ""Why are you here?"" she asks finally.

""I just... I wanted to see how you were doing,"" he says.

Lily scoffs. ""Nothing's changed since the last time we saw each other. I'm still a mudblood, and we all know how you feel about that, don't we?""

""I never thought of you like that."" Snape says, after a pause to think. ""Not even when we were kids. You were always... You were always just like me.""

""What is that supposed to mean?"" She asks coldly. Lily knows what he's saying, deep down, what he's about to say, but she doesn't want that to be it.

""Your father was... He was like Potter, but you were never... you were never like that."" Snape says carefully, as if he is afraid to offend. Little does he know, he is doing more damage like that than he would if he were honest in his intentions. ""You were like me, and not... Like Potter was. You know.  Foreign ."" He says, the distaste in his voice a little too obvious, a little too unguarded.

Lily can feel the blood rushing to her face. Layered under Snape's words, she hears the classmates who would ask her, ""so what are you,  really?"". She sees every confused look from passers-by she would get when she was out alone with her father.

She wants to scream at Snape, hex him maybe, but instead she musters up all the ice in her voice she can and looks him square in the eye. ""Get out.""

Snape opens his mouth as though to argue, but something in her face must tell him how close she is to snapping, because instead he nods stiffly and gets up. ""If you ever come to your senses, maybe we can talk again,"" he bites out, and Lily nearly does hex him for that.

But then he's gone, and all Lily is left with is the sharp edges of the words he'd spoken and the bone-tired weariness of someone who'd heard the same words thousands of times before.

Lily calms down soon after Snape leaves. She can still feel the anger thrumming deep inside her, but this is an old anger she has lived with all her life, and it is not in danger of bubbling out of her. And, now that she is calm, she realizes a few things. 

The first is that she can't continue like this. She can grieve-- she has to-- but this wallowing is not helping anyone, least of all her. She knows that she could continue like this forever, sinking into her sadness until she forgets to feel anything else. And  God it would be so much easier than anything else, to live among memories of ghosts. But Lily has never been about doing what was easy, after all. And she wasn't about to start now.

The second is that she can't keep thinking of them as James and Harry. That might have been the people they were for the world, but Janardhan and Hari were  who they were , and she can't take that away from them just because it pains her so to remember them in everything they were. She has known this all along, but it had taken Snape trying to erase her, erase Janardhan and Hari's Lalitha, so callously for her to change.

She starts to make little lists in her head, tiny things she can accomplish because thinking about the reality of a life without them is so insurmountable. Go three hours without crying. Don't stay in your pyjamas all day. Remember to water the tulasi plant. She doesn't think about how if Janardhan were here, he'd tease her for this obsession she'd always had with her plans and her lists.

""En anbe, en uyire."" He'd tease, as he wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, bending down to rest his head in the space between her neck and shoulder. His hair, sticking up in a thousand different directions like usual, would tickle her cheek, and she'd try not to laugh. She can almost feel his fingers tapping some half-remembered rhythmic beat against her hip, can almost feel his breath, warm against the side of her neck. It is hard to remember, sometimes, that these moments with him are just memories. ""Ellaathukkume plan poda vendaam."" (My love, my life, you don't need to plan everything.)

But Janardhan isn't here to tell her that, so she does, partially out of spite, and partially because she wants to see if he'll come back, if she plans enough. She knows it is unreasonable-- nothing but a wish, a want, some ridiculous dream that will never come to fruition, but she can't help but think that, if she succeeds, he might come back, might groan at her again in that melodramatic way of his and make her forget the need for planning entirely.

The first time she tries to go a few hours without breaking down, she thinks about the time her boys once made each other cry by starting a food fight right before lunch on rasam sadham day and ends up choking back tears in the windowless bathroom of a tiny coffee-shop in the first half hour. She can almost hear them calling for her, Hari's tearful yells of ""Amma"" interspersed with Janardhan's ""Lalitha!"", and she clamps her hands over her ears like that will change something. There is a part of her that enjoys hearing their voices again, though, a part that is much larger than she'd like to admit, a part of her that doesn't even want to succeed, because succeeding would mean letting go of them, of her boys.

It feels like a betrayal of her boys to even live on without them, let alone start to build a life of her own. There is a nasty little voice in her head that says,  Janardhan wouldn't try so hard to move on -- and the thing is, she knows it's true, that if their positions were reversed, he'd dwell on the loss of her, of Hari, to his last breath.

But she is not Janardhan, and she cannot function like that, living a shadow of a life, walking in the footsteps of ghosts. So she takes a deep breath, and works to make her worst hell into a world she still wants to live in.

Lalitha has had enough of visitors showing up at her doorstep for a lifetime, and this heavy sense of disgruntlement is what she feels that morning when she realizes that there's yet another one. But then she opens the door, and-- it's Remus. He looks tired, she distantly notes, and then laughs internally because they're  all  tired, all the way down to their bones. And then she's smiling so wide her cheeks hurt and maybe crying a little too, because it's  Remus, and finally, she doesn't feel so alone.

They talk for hours about too many things to count, all the while ignoring the ghosts between them. She asks about Sirius, and learns that he's a mess, more or less. But he has Remus, and so she knows he will be okay, and she can see that Remus knows this too.

They don't talk about Peter.

Lalitha has tried not to think about Peter at all, really. She knows, on some level, that he's still out there somewhere, this man she and Janardhan had loved as a brother. The man who was responsible for the death of her family. But if she allows herself to feel that too deeply, to hold Peter accountable right now, she knows that the fury will be too much for her to bear, and she's already a mess of emotions even on her best days. One day, she knows, she will want to search him out and find out  why he would do this to her. To his best friend. To the little baby boy who had adored him.

But, until that day comes, she is content to pretend that Peter Pettigrew never existed at all.

When Remus gets up to leave, Lalitha panics for a second because she has to say something about everything that's happened, she can't just leave it like this. But then he smiles and says ""It was really good to see you,"" and it's okay, because he  knows . Remus has always been good at knowing the words unsaid.

Lalitha smiles. ""It was... It was good to see you too,"" and it's the first time in a long time that she's said that and meant it.

There's a letter from Pavi-no, Petunia, Lalitha has to remind herself. She hasn't been Pavithra for a long time-- since they were kids, really. It says 'To Lily' on the envelope, and though Lalitha isn't surprised, it does sting a little. Petunia has always done her best to erase anything that might make her different, from having a sibling who could do magic to having a parent who wasn't white.

Lalitha remembers the friends she used to bring home, blonde and blue-eyed with whispered comments and wrinkled noses at the murukku their father would sometimes put out. Lalitha had always hated them and hoped that one day Petunia would realize, too, how they didn't know her, not really. They loved Petunia but they knew nothing of Pavithra, who was once so proud that her name meant pure, but disappeared somewhere along the way.

But that was the way Petunia had wanted it, and in the end, she'd married one of those friends. Vernon Dursley, someone who was so unlike them in every way possible. So unlike them, in fact, that Lalitha often privately thought that Vernon was inhuman-- he resembled a walrus more than he did any of the other white people she knew.

That had been one of the first things she'd found in common with Janardhan-- an entirely understandable hatred for Vernon Dursley. It had started at that infernal wedding, when Vernon had turned up his nose at Lalitha's ""choice in partner"", even though neither she or Janardhan had even given a thought to an actual relationship, at that point. Of course, she found out much later that he definitely had, but seventeen year old Lalitha was still securely in the dark. 

Once Petunia and Vernon had left them alone, Janardhan had pulled the most hilarious face, a surprisingly accurate imitation of Vernon's ever present scowl, and had grumbled about drills and ""those damn immigrants"" for a solid two minutes, to get a laugh out of her. It had certainly worked, and so well that she'd nearly inhaled a quarter of her glass of water, and he'd ended up patting her on the back awkwardly while she coughed loudly.

Lalitha is almost tempted to throw the letter out.

She doesn't know what it contains, but it doesn't matter-- she and Petunia weren't exactly on the best terms. It was probably either vitriol or empty condolences many years too late, which was somehow even worse. But then she reminds herself that after all, this is her sister. The rift between them had grown so great that sometimes Lalitha didn't even feel like they were living on the same planet, but there was a part of her that had always held out hope that one day they might be on the same page again.

So she opens the letter and finds a cordial, although concise, invitation to tea. Lalitha can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this is close to the bottom of the list of things she wants to do with her life. She doesn't want to face Petunia, with her quietly smug satisfaction at the way her life has turned out compared to Lalitha's. She can almost hear Petunia's voice.  Look where magic got you. Maybe you were special and I wasn't, but at least I still have Vernon and Dudley .

But Lalitha has isolated herself from everyone for so long, and she knows that this isn't sustainable, not for her. This will be good for her, she thinks.

So she finds herself at her sister's home at the appointed time. The whole neighbourhood couldn't be more  Petunia if it tried-- the houses are exact copies in precise little rows, lawns trimmed to perfection, not a thing out of place. She stares at the front door for a good minute, psyching herself up to ring the bell. When she does, she has to wait only a second before the door swings open and she finds herself face to face with the sister she hasn't seen for over three years.

Petunia looks much the same. Her blonde hair is pulled back into a severe bun, and she looks at Lalitha disdainfully. ""You're late,"" she pronounces, as if the world should revolve around her, and Lalitha tries her best not to turn around right then and there. She promised herself she would do this, and now that she's here, she might as well see it through.

 Hello to you too, Lalitha thinks, but puts on an apologetic expression. ""There was a lot of traffic."" It's a joke because of course she'd apparated, but maybe it will lighten the mood a little.

Petunia eyes her suspiciously. ""I thought you people didn't use cars,"" she says. 

Lalitha winces internally. She should've known it would've fallen flat-- Petunia had never been one for humor after all. ""Yeah, we don't, I just... never mind."" She hadn't missed the usage of  you people  either. Petunia had the unique talent of making something so innocuous sound like  you freaks .

There's a moment where Lalitha stands awkwardly on Petunia's doorstep, waiting to be invited in. The silence is broken by the patter of little feet and suddenly there is a tiny boy standing next to Petunia, peering up at Lalitha. He tugs on his mother's skirt. ""Mummy, who's that?""

And then, Lalitha's heart is in her mouth because this must be Dudley. This is Dudley, and he looks nothing like Hari, with his pale skin and blond hair and rosy cheeks but all she can see when she looks at him is her baby. Her Hari, with his quick smile and always curious green eyes and full, chubby cheeks. Hari, who had just learned to run reliably, and had been doing so at every opportunity.  He will never be this old, she thinks, and it's everything she can do to not break down crying right there. 

Petunia doesn't seem to notice the look on her face, or if she does, she has the decency not to say anything-- Lalitha is willing to bet it's probably the former, knowing her sister. ""This is your Aunt Lily,"" says Petunia to Dudley.

Lalitha forces a smile. ""Hello, Dudley,"" she says, leaning down to shake his hand. Dudley stares at her outstretched hand and then looks up at her, frowning seriously in the way that only four, almost five, year olds can. She imagines Hari, taller and face a little thinned out, looking at her the same way, and the sudden flash of pain, bright and terrifying, in her chest makes her wonder if her heart really is breaking.

""I don't like you,"" he announces haughtily, his resemblance to his mother heightened for a moment, before scampering off. Lalitha stares after him, startled, before looking up at Petunia, who has the faint traces of a smile. 

""He takes after his father,"" she says, and her smile is almost smug. Lalitha thinks about how the first thing people would ever say when they saw Hari was  he looks so much like his father! And Hari had-- he had Janardhan's lazy, easy smile, and their faces were nearly identical, save for the fact that Hari had Lalitha's eyes. And then, all of a sudden, he was dead, and no one really said much of anything about him anymore.

""Well, I suppose you should come on inside,"" says Petunia, as though it is the last thing in the world she wants. Lalitha knows it probably is. She is suddenly very, very tired. This isn't the delighted reconnection with her sister she'd maybe hoped for-- Petunia clearly wants something from her, and she still doesn't know what.

She follows her sister into her home, distantly taking in the obsessively neat decor. There's a wall filled with photographs of Dudley, Vernon and Petunia, in various poses-- professional portraits, casual photos at the beach, birthday parties for Dudley.

Lalitha, Janardhan and Hari had never really been able to take many pictures of all three of them-- after all, they had been in hiding for all of Hari's life. 

There is a photo from the day Hari was born, of him lying fast asleep in Lalitha's arms as she rocked him. Janardhan was standing off to the side, looking at them both like he might actually die if he looked away. Anyone could look at it and feel how happy they are, how relieved and hopeful they are, and sometimes, when being in hiding had gotten too tough, Lalitha had dug it out just to remind herself that she felt that way, once. 

And then, there's a photo of the three of them from Hari's first birthday party. In it, Hari is laughing as Janardhan tosses him up in the air, arms spread out as if he is trying to fly. She is the one off to the side, this time, looking on with the brightest smile she had ever seen on her face. Lalitha's heart aches, thinking about it, because, just three months later, two of the people in it were dead. 

Lalitha no longer looks at those photos, because it is too painful. And she doesn't need to anyway-- she has memorized everything about them, from the curve of Hari's grin to the sound of Janardhan's laughter. It is easy to memorize something when you are constantly seeing it play out in your head.

They reach the sitting room before she can sink too deeply into her thoughts, and a voice calls out as they enter, ""Oh, Petunia, this must be Lily!"" The voice belongs to a well dressed man, his brown hair held flat against his head with so much gel that it resembles a helmet, who obviously has more money than he knows what to do with, and was, judging by the way he was positioned in his chair, conversing excitedly with Vernon Dursley just seconds earlier. Already, not Lalitha's favorite type of person. ""You know, she's even prettier than you said she was."" 

Lalitha blinks at him. ""'She' is also right here,"" she says. It's an effort to keep her voice pleasant.

""Don't be rude, Lily,"" Petunia scolds. She turns to the man. ""Excuse my sister, Nigel. She hasn't been well recently.""

As annoyed as Lalitha is, she cannot help but want to laugh. 'Hasn't been well'? She'd witnessed the aftermath of her family's murder.  Good old Petunia, always stating the obvious .

""I'm sorry."" Nigel replies glibly. ""Illness is always tough. I'm glad you're in good health now.""

""Illness?"" Lalitha repeats. ""I wasn't--""

""Lily, why don't you go freshen up before tea?"" Petunia cuts in. Lalitha turns to argue, but stops at Petunia's warning look. ""The washroom is down the hall to the left,"" Petunia continues, and Lalitha shoves her anger to the side and tries not to storm off.

""Quite a pleasant girl."" She hears Nigel say, down the hallway. ""I must say, Vernon, she's not that bad. I'm glad you and Petunia set this up."" They set this up. The thought makes her sick. This is what Petunia wanted. She should've known-- Petunia never did anything without an ulterior motive. Petunia, the schemer, always in possession of a greater plan. Suddenly, Lalitha is thankful for the fact that she used to call her sister Paavi as a child. Sinner was definitely much more of a fitting name for her.

All throughout the horrendously awkward tea that follows, Lalitha does her best to deflect any attempt at conversation from Nigel. Nigel doesn't seem to realize that he's ignored, and pontificates on all the subjects Vernon brings up, as if trying to impress her. Lalitha is markedly unimpressed, and, by the end of the visit, she feels like someone's literally grating at her nerves.

Nigel, who is also on his way out, is horrendously eager to arrange another meeting. ""Will I be seeing you again?"" He asks, far too enthusiastic given the fact that she's been trying to project disinterest as much as possible.

Lalitha looks him straight in the eye. ""I'm sure my husband wouldn't like that,"" she says coldly.

""Y--Your husband?"" Nigel stammers, turning bright red. Good, Lalitha thinks. It feels oddly like it had when she was picking out cabbages, and she files away the thought for later. ""I-- I wasn't aware, I'm sorry. Petunia hadn't mentioned that you were... spoken for.""

Petunia, on her part, looks as though she has swallowed an entire lemon. ""That's because he's dead,"" she snaps.

""Yes, that's... that's..."" Nigel looks rather embarrassed, and then all but runs for the door. ""Vernon, I'll see you at work tomorrow. Thank you for having me."" He says, before shutting the front door behind him, and Lalitha can see him striding down the driveway toward a fancy looking car, looking like he's been punched in the stomach.

Petunia rounds on Lalitha as soon as the door closes. ""I can't believe you were so rude!"" she shouts, and then all of the tension and fury that's been simmering under the surface boils over.

""Rude?"" Lalitha repeats. ""Rude? Petunia, my husband and son are dead and my own sister is pretending they never existed! And I'm the rude one for telling him I'm married?""

""Because you're not !"" Petunia hisses. ""You're not married, because he's dead, and you owe it to yourself to move past him. You could do better, and to wreck your life over him...""

""I'm not wrecking my life!"" says Lalitha in disbelief. ""I lost my family, Petunia! I'm still grieving! And if you loved me at all, if you were a good sister, you'd understand that!""

""Family,"" sniffs Petunia derisively. ""You knew him for what, four years? He's not  family.  Don't be so dramatic.""

""He was more family to me then you ever will be,"" says Lalitha, and, with that, Apparates out.

She's had enough of the Dursleys for a lifetime.

Lalitha and Remus go out and get coffee or tea together at least once weekly now, because Lalitha's chai is honestly the worst thing on this planet. She wasn't just saying that for fun. One time, she'd actually gotten Janardhan sick, and in between rounds of vomiting, he'd sworn that he was never letting her in the kitchen again. To this day, she didn't know what she'd messed up that time, but thankfully, it hadn't happened a second time. Or, she thinks, perhaps she just hadn't had enough time to repeat the mistake.

This is how their meetings usually go-- they sit at a coffeeshop and make up horrible backstories for people that walk by. On his good days, Sirius even joins them, but Sirius' terrible backstories are always horrible, and not in the good way.

""That man, with the polka dotted tie?"" Sirius says, stroking his chin dramatically. He is trying to grow a beard, this week. Lalitha wants to tell him that it looks stupid, but she's afraid of what he'll do if she does. Janardhan had had a much better beard, she thinks wistfully. ""That's his only set of clothes."" Sirius pauses for impact, looking around. Neither Remus nor Lalitha look suitably impressed, according to him, because he continues anyway. ""His entire family died in a fire, and he wanders the streets in the only set of clothes he has left, searching for justice.""

""That doesn't make any sense,"" says Remus. ""Why doesn't he just get new clothes? Or did his bank burn down too?""

""It's called suspension of disbelief, Remus,"" says Sirius with narrowed eyes. 

""More like suspension of all logic,"" mutters Remus.

""I think the real question here is what on earth possessed him to buy that tie,"" cuts in Lalitha. ""It's hideous.""

""It's tasteful."" Sirius says, pouting. ""I like it.""

""You would,"" says Remus with a roll of his eyes.

Hearing Remus and Sirius banter is equal parts amusing and painful. Painful, because Lalitha can hear the empty spaces where Janardhan might have interjected a sarcastic comment or a terrible joke.

It's strange, sometimes, how they're only barely twenty-six but have lived lifetimes more than most people ever will. No one ever talks about the aftermath of a war, when all people are left with are the pieces to pick up. Too many of them have been left behind by family and friends alike, and she knows that she is lucky in that not all of them have been able to function in the way she has.

She's come a long way from the person who broke down in a coffee shop thinking about her boys having a rasam sadham fight. Her grief is more of a dull ache now, that flares occasionally when she sees flashes of Hari in children on the street or notices particularly involved dads at the park, and thinks of how Janardhan would've been right there with the best of them, if he'd had a chance. She thinks it will always be like that. She can't imagine ever not seeing her boys in everything, and she imagines life would be quite lonely, without the little winks and nods from them sprinkled through, like little surprises for her to find. They are playing a scavenger hunt, almost, and she is finding their clues as much as she can, even the ones that break her heart a little.

They're all a little broken, with jagged edges and missing pieces. And maybe Lalitha will never be whole again. But maybe she doesn't have to be. Maybe getting up every morning and daring herself to face the world is enough.

Lalitha tunes in again to Remus and Sirius bickering about the stylishness of polka dotted clothing and her shoulders relax as she smiles. This sounds like a good place to start.

No letter arrives in June of 1991, because there is no almost eleven year old in Lalitha Iyer's house. 

Lalitha sits in a park and basks in the sun's slanting rays as the sound of children's laughter surrounds her. The paai she sits on is just big enough for two, and she can almost see Janardhan sprawled out beside her on the grass mat, sticking his fingers through the gaps in the weaving and laughing as he tells Hari whatever terrible pun he's just come up with. She doesn't have to think too hard to imagine Hari-- she knows that he would have been an exact copy of Janardhan at eleven, when she first saw him, all gangly limbs and uncontained energy.

No letter arrives in June of 1991. 

A concerned mother rushes to attend to a toddler who has scraped her knee. Lalitha has to fight not to laugh because Janardhan had always been good at injuring himself, and she can see Hari right now, tripping over his own feet and thin air alike, just like he would have tripped through life. She knows he would've always rushed in headfirst to every situation, never thinking about consequences, but it would've been alright, because she and Janardhan would have been there to pick up the pieces for him.

It is no longer a burden to miss them, she realizes. There's a kind of comfort in her grief, now. It's like an old blanket, familiar and warm, and she can wrap herself in her grief, her memories of what she has lost.

No letter arrives in June of 1991.

He always has hope, always fights hard, always gives everything he's got, and then falls just steps short of the finish line -- a heart attack, a poisoning, a disembowelment by a faceless enemy. Always too close, but no cigar. Always just on the edge of fulfilling his potential. Always an almost.

James Potter is rude and cruel and arrogant, and his friends (save for Remus) are much the same. They roll around on the floor of the Entrance Hall like puppies, run screaming down hallways, push each other down bannisters, and act like Hogwarts is their personal playground instead of a school they could very well be expelled from. They don't understand what it takes for people with less means (for people like Lily) to come to places like this, to get an opportunity to learn like this -- they live in a world where they can blissfully ignore the storm brewing outside the castle in a way Lily never will be able to.

But then, they do what she thought they never would: they grow up. Sirius Black learns to apologize. Peter Pettigrew learns to use his voice. Remus Lupin fights back against a world that's had him pinned against a wall with a hand around his neck.

And James Potter loses his razor sharp edges and melts into something truly beautiful. James Potter, somehow, against all odds, becomes kind. He becomes friendly. He replaces the bricks and mortar he'd torn from Lily's boundary walls and steps back, wiping his hands off on his trousers, and runs in the opposite direction.

So when he smiles at her for the first time (really smiles, not the fake smirk he pastes on while he directs Hogwarts' student body like a ringmaster at a circus), something within her aches, something dark and melancholy, and she thinks that the war snapping at their heels like an angry beast might take him to teach them all a lesson. They are all taking their roles now, stepping into archetypes crafted long before they were born, and James has unknowingly signed away his own life.

James Potter shines like the sun, too bright to look at straight on, and Lily Evans, like the stories have always foretold, falls in love.

Boys who look like James never get to be the hero.

He looks at himself in the mirror, skin the color of old pottery, eyes like honey, and thinks: heroism is not for me. 

Heroism is for boys like Sirius, with faces pale as the moon and gray eyes that carry knife strikes of disdain within them like a secret. Heroism is for boys like Peter, who get hailed as unexpected legends, as the hero no one saw coming, as a subversion of everyone's expectations. Heroism is for boys like Remus, boys who are carrying the weight of infinite sorrows but still redeem themselves, flying up to the sun like an Icarus with wings stuck with something stronger than wax, the glue that only years of suffering can make. 

Heroism is not for James, a boy with a name stolen from a language that doesn't belong to him, acting like he has a place here, like this could be his home in the same way it is Sirius', Remus', and Peter's. Heroism is not for a boy whose family name sparks hatred in people's hearts for something so simple as insisting Muggles can be, must be, just as human as wizards. Heroism is not for a boy who has grown up on the edges of a world that embraced Sirius, embraced Peter, but requires him to play like he's one of them, to spit at and kick Remus like he doesn't belong.

James would do well to steer far clear of the war. To go abroad with his parents, to go home, and shut his eyes and ears to injustice. To wait out the deaths and the suffering and come back when it was settled (or not come back at all). But because James is James, he signs up for the Order of the Phoenix the morning they all leave school. His parents didn't raise him to do the easy thing -- they raised him to do the right thing.

But there is still a tiny part of James that wants to be a hero, that wants to steal back the plot from the boys the world calls more suited to it, and say this is mine. This is mine and I will carry it with honor. This belongs to me.

When boys like James play the hero, they nearly always die. He conveniently ignores that.

Sirius Black has known exactly who he is from the moment he tumbled forth into the world, into the Healer's hands, into the cage of the Black family's reputation. Sirius Black has never doubted himself for a moment, has never even entertained the idea that he might like to change, that change might be good for him, that it might be good for those around him. Sirius smiles like a shark, rows of teeth ready to bite, and licks his bloody, cracked lips at the thought of an opportunity to be seen, to be known, to be loved.

Sirius Black knows he will be a martyr -- one side or the other will grow tired of his antics, his recklessness, his unpredictability, and they will kill him. He wonders how it will happen. A knife to the chest? Too mundane. Too boring. A poisoned drink would be interesting, at least, and he inspects every glass he takes at Order meetings with great caution. He thinks of all the great paintings, all the great plays, every book he read, and wonders in what form Death will come for him. Will it be an Avada Kedavra, clean and simple? Or something bloodier, something that will spawn poetry? Will it be someone he knows? Will it be someone he's hurt? Will it be entirely random, an act of chance, a miscalculation by the universe?

It is all a mystery, but Sirius embraces life as if martyrdom is guaranteed, as if it is an essential law of the universe that he will not live to see the end of the war. Boys from bad homes who grow up snatching pieces of happiness from the world to hoard like dragons are always punished. There are never happy endings for children who didn't have a happy beginning.

Peter has never seen himself as a potential hero, has spent too much time playing every single side of a scenario to call any one cause his own. 

He sees James and Sirius, commitment and conviction personified and bound together by brotherhood, and he wishes he were built for that, wishes he too could be a monument to a future that was promised to them but now has to be fought for, tooth and nail. He wishes he had Remus' fortitude, Sirius' ability to breeze through anything at all with his heart safely guarded beyond several locked doors, James' easy confidence and self-worth. He called them friends once. Would they call him a friend now?

He has never felt as comfortable as he does under Voldemort's wing, and that strikes him as a betrayal, the first in a string of many, as he sits in the front room of the cottage in Godric's Hollow, sipping on a hot chocolate James had made him. Sirius and Remus newly done wrestling with Harry, lie on the carpet, exhausted but laughing so hard their chests heave like their bodies are playing tug of war with the floor, and Peter wishes he could feel at ease here again. He wishes he could feel like one of them again, like one of four boys rowing in rhythm to bring the boat of their lives to shore.

Peter knows where he stands, in the story of their lives, the betrayer, the one who said goodbye first, the one who shattered their friendship beyond repair. He understands that, someday, people will call him evil in whispered voices. He just hopes it will be behind his back, where he can ignore it. He hopes that he will have the power to silence them with his deeds, his smarts, his actions, when people talk. 

He hopes that his friends will be alive to see it, but he knows better.

Peter may not be a hero, but he sure as hell doesn't think of himself as a villain. Don't most people fall somewhere in the middle anyway?

Remus is the last one left, the last man standing, the last Marauder.

It's cruel.

He never thought he, of all people, would be the only one left to see Harry pass over that thin, arbitrary line of a seventeenth birthday into manhood. He never thought it would be him, the sickly werewolf, the least favored friend (though he knows that's not true now, now that Peter sealed his own fate years ago), the one least suited to giving Harry the quiet, calm life he deserves. Instead, he watches happiness dance in Harry's eyes like it had in Lily's long ago, watches him smile James' same boyish, self-conscious smile. He watches Harry struggle to tie his shoes, watches Harry tell the worst jokes he's ever heard, and lets the river of time run forward toward its inevitable conclusion.

There are no old werewolves.

It is not a matter of werewolves passing into old age unseen, quietly disappearing into the embrace of society. They are all dead, gone somewhere beyond Remus' vision, and someday, he will join them. Maybe, if he is lucky, he will end up where James, Lily, and Sirius must be, a happy place, a good place, somewhere bright and beautiful. Maybe, if he is lucky, he will be allowed to spend the rest of the universe's time with them.

But he's never been lucky.

If he were lucky, would he have been bitten at all? If he were lucky, would he have lived to see his friends die, one by one, like crows leaving their perches on a power line? If he were lucky, if anything in the universe loved him, would he have watched his son (his son, his son, the words have a certain magic to them no matter where the emphasis falls) be born just weeks before heading off to war?

Remus is not a hero. Remus is a sidekick. But the sidekicks never have good chances, and the charity cases fare even worse.

Too bad Remus is both.

James has grown up with the knowledge that the human body is nothing more than a glorified suitcase for an eternal soul. Death is nothing more than forgetting it at the train station and climbing on without your things, realizing only when the train has left the station that your bag is still sitting by the bench you were waiting on, forgotten in your hurry. Even then, he is surprised when he dies, surprised by the instant shock of it. The strange sensation of being without a body, without limits. 

He sees the front room of the cottage, in Godric's Hollow, and behind him is the foot of the stairs where he'd-- where he'd-- oh well, there was no sense in avoiding the word died now that he was already dead, was there? He'd died there, a hand on the railing, and woken up on the floor like he'd gone on a drunken bender instead of running right at one of the most powerful wizards of the day without a wand. Even now, he didn't have a wand. 

He laughs, at his empty hands and empty pockets, at the horror of a life he's consigned his wife and son to, at what a horrible husband and father he's been, if he's signed over their lives. He could have fought longer, could have picked a better Secret Keeper, could have been so much more for his wife, for his son. He could have believed it could be about him, when Dumbledore said there was a prophecy, could have believed that Voldemort would choose his son. But no one ever chose boys that looked like James as the hero, no one had ever deemed him important enough to mark as the herald of their death, and James stupidly assumed that his son would be the same. 

Harry is a pretty boy with James' copper skin and Lily's green eyes, who sings along to songs of the radio with off tune screeches, and recently learned how to jump, much to everyone's consternation. Harry is hardly a boy yet, can't dress himself or get out of his crib alone or sleep through the night, and now he will learn those things without James, without his father, at his side. Harry will learn what the world is like, for boys like them, without a father to guide his path, to hold him when things are unfair and teach him to be proud of his work, of himself, of what he can do, in the few sparkling instances that they are not.

James crumples into a ball at the foot of the stairs and weeps, not for himself but for the son he's left behind, a son with no history and a deadly inheritance in the color of his skin, a prophecy hanging over his head that will, without a doubt, kill him some day. The hero never survives all the way, even if his body lives on -- something must always be sacrificed. Death's thirst always get sated, one way or another, and James can see it circling over his son, even if this isn't the cottage, isn't the same stairway, isn't the same world. Even if this is a sick parody of the place he'd lived and loved.

His son will be sacrificed to save other children.

Will he ever be able to repay whatever part of Harry remains? Will he ever be able to apologize for what he's done? Will Harry ever forgive him?

He should have known better. Nothing ever ends well for boys who look like him, in stories. From the beginning to the end, he should have known better.

Lily awakens on the nursery floor and hears the soft sound of crying from downstairs and thinks, for a second, that it is Harry. That it is Harry, who has somehow run fast enough past Voldemort to avoid death despite being all too fond of sliding slowly down the stairs on his stomach, one step at a time. She loses herself in that certainty for a second, that her son has survived, before reminding herself who is at the foot of the stairs. Who was at the foot of the stairs. Who has to be, if this is their home.

She feels like she is abandoning her son, with each step she takes toward the doorway of the nursery, her heart thumping painfully in her chest when she slips past it into something new, something unknown. Each step down the hall prompts a stabbing, ripping pain somewhere deep inside her. She can't turn around. There's no reason to turn around. 

There's nothing in this nursery.

She places a foot on the stairs and James looks up instantly, eyes bleary, having sensed her presence finally, and she runs toward him, never doubting him for a second, launching herself into his arms like she often did after a long Order mission, sobbing into his shirt. And James, as he's always done, comforts her. He wraps himself around her like a blanket, like armor, like a wall against the world, and lets her cry, lets her scream, lets her do anything she needs to fight her way back to whatever will be their new normal. His tears drip into her hair, his nose digging uncomfortably into the top of her head, and they grieve into each other, hands clutching at each other with a desperation they've never felt before.

""I love you."" Her voice has been wrung out like a wet dish towel, hoarse and creaky, but he smiles like he has been given a gift, her words lighting him up from the inside. James is a candle, a firework, a lightbulb -- something electric and fiery coursing through him in eternity -- but he's muted now in death, like there is some deep, dark sadness within him now that cannot ever fully be chased away. 

James has been switched off, forever. 

He doesn't say anything immediately afterward, brushes her hair out of her face with careful, shaking hands and kisses her like she is something precious, made of glass or porcelain, infinitely breakable.

""I'm so sorry."" He says and she crumbles again, safe within the circle of his arms. She'd often joked, when they were children who didn't know better, that she could never live without him. And now, she wishes she hadn't been so certain that a life without him wasn't worth living, that he hadn't agreed with her, so one of them could have survived to love their son. She wishes they hadn't loved each other so much, after saying those three words, and finds it hilarious that James picked three different ones for what was likely the same reason. ""I'm so sorry. I never meant for us to be here.""

""I know, baby, I know."" Lily fists her hands in his shirt. ""You didn't know. Neither of us did."" 

She wonders how long it had felt for him, being without her, remembers intimately the seconds between hearing the thudding noise his body had made against the floor and Voldemort appearing in the doorway of the nursery. She remembers each and every one of Voldemort's footsteps, his taunting words floating up ahead of him, the reminder that her husband had died for them, James' last heroic blaze of bravery doing nothing to protect him from mortality. 

It had felt like hours, for her. Days and days of torture. And here he was, as always, packing himself away for her, ready to welcome her with open arms whenever she was ready. She remembers that first real smile, the way he'd left space for her in every moment after, and reaches to grab his shirt collar and pull him down into another kiss, a hungry one, in the hopes that it would tell him everything she found herself incapable of saying.

I love you.

I am so happy you are not alone here anymore.

I wish we were both still with him but this is better than nothing.

James seems to understand, when she pulls away, something in his eyes hazy and unfocused, because he smiles, a ghost of the smile Lily remembers, but just enough to convince her. He pulls her close, arms wrapped tight around her, her head resting against his chest, and says sorry again, then a third time, then a fourth, each one blending into the next like scarves pulled out of a magician's mouth, and she gently punches him in the jaw.

""Ow, fuck."" He says, words slurred and uneven. ""I bit my fucking tongue.""

""Stop saying sorry, then."" She challenges, words still heavy with recently shed tears. ""Stop saying sorry and help me make this doable, then.""

""Yeah."" James says softly. ""Yeah."" And then he smiles, and then it feels real.

Sirius falls through a curtain and into the kitchen at Godric's Hollow, where James and Lily are making badly constructed robot horses joust with butterknives. They don't notice him for a second until Lily's knife falls off her horse and Sirius dives to catch it, bumping his chin on the tiles. 

""I hate everything."" He complains, and has only a second before James decides Sirius needs to get to know the floor face to face and jumps onto his back, screaming incoherently while nuzzling the back of his head. 

""It's good to see you again."" Lily says, kicking James off his back. Sirius scrambles to his feet, thankful to be freed, but has only a second before they both tackle him from either side, Lily barely avoiding knocking her head on the countertop as they all go down in a pile again. 

""Can't we do this somewhere more comfortable?"" Sirius whines, but feels at peace for the first time in years, the first time since October 31st, 1981. ""Why do you two always have to be so violent?""

""You're talking about violence? You? Sirius Black?"" James says, incredulous. ""Don't corrupt me, my wife has a hard enough time as it is.""

""God, I've been here some ten seconds and it's already 'my wife' this, 'my wife' that. I'll go find another place. Somewhere with single men."" Sirius groans, but loops an arm around James' neck, trapping his throat between elbow and bicep like a vice before rubbing his knuckles into James' head. That would teach him. ""I don't need losers cramping my style.""

""But we're winners."" Lily says sweetly. ""We won the Board Game Triathlon of July 1980.""

""You were in labor! We let you cheat until you absolutely couldn't wait anymore!"" Sirius exclaims. ""I'm still surprised you didn't have Harry right there on the couch, with how long you were willing to wait just to win Trivial Pursuit.""

Suddenly, he thinks of Harry and Remus, still in the Department of Mysteries, probably at risk of death themselves. Would James and Lily be so happy to see him if they'd known that Sirius had left Harry and Remus to die? If Harry and Remus followed him here, one after another, like little ducks in a line, would James and Lily still be so happy to see him?

""Harry."" James says, hazel eyes searching Sirius' face. ""Have you seen him? They gave him to you, right? He never-- he never showed up here, so..."" He looks to Lily, hope clear in his eyes, and she looks to Sirius, putting him on the spot. ""You look... older."" He frowns. ""How much older? How old is he now?""

""Do you not know?"" Sirius asks, a bolt of terror shooting through him. ""James, how old are you?""

""Twenty-one. Same as Lily."" James says. ""How much... how much time has passed?"" He looks to Lily, fear clear in his eyes. ""There are no... no clocks, no anything outside the house. It's like we're in a little pocket of the universe by ourselves.""

""He's about to turn sixteen. It's mid June, now. School's about to let out."" Sirius says softly, and James and Lily both recoil in horror. ""Nearly as old as his parents, now."" He can't resist making the joke, but they both wince, and it feels awful. ""He's getting his OWLs back this summer. He expects he'll do well."" 

He doesn't know what else to say, the secret of Harry's childhood with Petunia and Vernon feeling like too much for one conversation. Harry's hard won trust, the way he scouted out rooms on an endless loop of anxiety, the way he held his breath when any adult looked right at him, none of that was what James and Lily needed to hear.

""He looks just like you, James."" Sirius says instead. ""Like a fucking giraffe with glasses.""

James bursts into laughter.

""We taught him to shave last summer, Remus and I, and he nearly cut his own face off with a safety razor."" Sirius begins to laugh himself. ""He's got your temper, Lily. The world bites and he bites back. It's beautiful to watch. He's found-- he's found the Map! The Weasley twins, Fred and George, they've given it to him and Harry's used it to find empty classrooms to sit in. God, Evans, he's so much like you that it hurts sometimes.""

Lily, still shocked, reaches around Sirius to grab James' arm.

""Nearly sixteen."" James says softly. ""It feels like he was a baby just yesterday. For us, he was a baby just yesterday."" He stands up slowly. ""It's a lot to take in at once."" His eyes cut over to Lily, who's pulled herself up to her feet using the countertop, helping Sirius up after. ""Nearly sixteen. I can hardly believe it. We've been dead almost...""

""Fifteen years this October."" Sirius says, like an apology. ""He asked about you nearly every day. Wanted to know everything we could tell him. Didn't have much that was kid appropriate, but--""

""Oh, come on, what did we do that wasn't kid appropriate--"" Lily interrupts.

""We made the kid in question, I guess--"" James shrugs.

""Oh, shut up, both of you. He's a great kid and he'd be better with you there, but he's pretty damn perfect."" Sirius says. ""He's a wonderful kid and it's all you two. It's all what the two of you gave him. The rest of us just... helped him along.""

""Fifteen years."" Lily smiles. ""You've got a lot to tell us."" She reaches out for Sirius' hand. ""No time like the present, right?""

""No clocks either."" Sirius quips. ""If James can be believed.""

""Oh, shut it."" James complains, and there it is, the easy rhythm Sirius had missed for half of his life, wrapped up in a bow for him again.

Death isn't half bad.

Peter ends up somewhere cold and dark and lonely.

He deserves it.

Remus stumbles up to the door of a familiar cottage, knocks on the door, afraid of what he'll find. He knocks again, when there's no response, then the door swings open to reveal Harry, sleepy eyed and without his glasses and-- no, that's not Harry. That's James. It hits him like a punch in the stomach, that this is James, James who he has been hungry for, begging for, praying for for almost seventeen years, and the moment Remus has been given his wishes, he doesn't see them for what they are.

James catches him without a thought, the two of them forever caught up in a game of cat and mouse fueled by order and chaos and all those eternal things. They were supposed to be eternal. They were supposed to live forever, two dumb teenagers uniquely suited to understand what it meant to not really feel at home anywhere, clawing their way up into security and joy with their last dregs of strength. But James had died and now Remus is dead, both of them leaving young sons behind, and that is the first thing Remus says to his best friend.

""My son's name is Edward. Teddy. I wanted to call him Teddy.""

""I'm an uncle."" James says, awe and wonder turning his words into fireworks. ""You're a dad. Remus, that's brilliant."" He looks over his shoulder into the house and yells ""Sirius, Lily, it's Remus!""

""Everyone's here?"" Remus asks softly, not believing his luck. 

""We were all waiting for you."" James ruffles Remus' hair, then pats his back like they'd just taught the Giant Squid to play fetch again. ""We're not us without you, Remus. Never. That's true everywhere.""

""You've gone soft in your old age."" Remus says, words rocky and uneven because the sunburst of feeling in his chest is forcing its way out of him. ""What, you're a fucking poet now?""

""No, I'm twenty-one."" James says, though he sounds a lot older. ""And that means I'm entitled to be ridiculous all the time.""

""I'm thirty-seven."" Remus says. ""I'm fucking old as balls.""

""Lovely."" James winks. ""We'll make quite the pair, then.""

He barely jumps out of the way as Lily comes barreling into Remus next, a veritable hurricane of words masquerading as a conversation pouring out of her, and James looks on in mild amusement for a second before disappearing back into the cottage. Remus has hardly gotten Lily to calm down enough to leave actual spaces between her words when Sirius is standing in the doorway, staring at Remus like the universe has spat him up on their doorstep which, if Remus were to think about it in an overly mundane way, it did.

""Sirius."" Remus says, grateful, thinking of the moment Sirius had fallen through the Veil, how Remus would've pulled him back if he could. ""Sirius, I--""

""You did well with him, Remus."" Sirius comes forward slowly, places a hand on Remus' shoulder. He pats it twice, thrice, trying to appear as casual as possible, before wrapping his arms around Remus. ""You did so well, Remus.""

James joins in, resting his chin on Remus' shoulder and throwing his arms around them both. ""We couldn't have left him with anyone better, Remus."" His voice breaks slightly as he buries his face in the side of Remus' neck. ""Your Teddy would've been incredibly lucky to have you.""

""Teddy?"" Sirius asks, confused.

""My son."" Remus says, voice shaking. ""Edward Remus Lupin."" 

Lily's face falls. She'd been the only one to know how dearly Remus had wanted a child even as a child himself, how his first fear, after being turned, was that he could never be a father someday. She'd been the only one to know how jealous he'd felt, watching James with Harry and knowing that could never be his. He is perversely grateful that Teddy will never see the full moon rise with fear in his heart, but all the same, he wishes he could hold his son again, watch Teddy blow spit bubbles with his little rosebud mouth once last time.

""He's a month old next week."" Remus says hoarsely. ""And I'm never going to see him again. I watched-- I saw his mother die. He's-- He's going to have none of us.""

""I'm so sorry, Remus."" Lily joins James and Sirius, and they all hold each other like old times, James and Lily gluing Sirius and Remus together effortlessly. ""I'm so-- I'm so sorry, Remus.""

""We're all together."" Remus says, eyes brimming with tears. ""It could be so much worse.""

One moment, James, Lily and Sirius are playing a rather boring game of Connect Four Times Three, a frankly terrible game they'd devised where three separate games of Connect Four are on at a time and there are all sorts of ridiculous penalties involved for playing games in the wrong order and not knowing exactly when your turn is in each one, while Remus referees. The next, they are standing in a forest, all four of them looking around in confusion. 

And then, at once, they all notice Harry, face streaked with mud and wavy hair matted to his head by sweat and dirt. He looks old, tired, exhausted, far beyond his seventeen years, and James would've run to him if he could. From chancing a glance over at Lily, he knows she is seconds from doing the same. Instead, she holds a hand out toward Harry, an invitation left open ended. 

Harry seems amazed, entranced, for a moment, before running to Lily, eyes filled with glee. He tries to take her hand, but his hand passes through hers and he squeezes his eyes shut, like it hurts him to be reminded that she is somewhere beyond him. 

""You've been so brave, sweetheart."" She says. 

""Why are you here?"" He asks. ""All of you.""

""We never left."" Lily says with a smile.

Harry nods slowly, his breathing heavy, and takes a look around the gathering again before making a bee line for James. He is a little more hesitant, this time, not as sure what to do with his father as his mother, but when Harry and James stand together, there is no mistaking them for anything than father and son. Perhaps brothers, James looking young for twenty-one and Harry looking old for seventeen, but their ears, their long fingers, the breadth of their shoulders, are all the same. They're within an inch of each other in height, the soft slope of their noses matching near perfectly, and when they smile at each other, it is like watching a mirror be invented for the first time.

""I always wondered what you'd think of me."" Harry said.

""Wonder no more."" James intones, sounding far too dramatic, and Harry laughs Lily's laugh, shrill and screeching. ""I think you're the best thing that ever happened to me. Sorry, Lily."" James holds his hands just millimeters from Harry's shoulder, giving them both the illusion of contact that they're craving. ""You're an incredible boy. An incredible man. Any father would be proud to call you his own. And I'm not just any father. I'm yours.""

""You're proud of me."" Harry sounds almost relieved, and James wants to scream. ""You really are?""

""Honest to God."" James' voice cracks and shatters, a dinner plate thrown against a tile floor. ""I'm a lucky man. You and your mother have made sure of that."" 

Harry smiles weakly at him, reaches toward James for a second before remembering his father's embrace is a tripping hazard, that he is trying to catch smoke in his hands. Watching him pack that simple want away is nothing short of torture, watching Harry realize something so normal, something so regular, cannot and will not be his until he's dead.

""When you come to us"", James says, ""a billion, million years from now, when you've got thousands of great-great-great-grandkids or something, you'll have all you want from us. Anything you want, we'll give it to you. I promise.""

""Anything I want."" Harry says. ""That's a loaded promise.""

""I don't mind."" James smiles. ""Go, Sirius is waiting."" He points to Sirius, bouncing around antsily like a child being denied attention. ""There'll be time later.""

Harry almost laughs, a choked, wet sound tearing its way out of him, but he walks over to Sirius and Remus on unsteady legs, like a newborn foal.

""I'm sorry."" He says, sounding so like James that Lily looks to James to assure herself he is still by her side. ""I'm sorry, to both of you. You should've-- you should've had years more than you did, Sirius, and I led you to-- to what, your death? Remus, Teddy-- Teddy shouldn't have to grow up without you, he should have his parents, he should have-- he should have what I didn't.""

""Teddy has an excellent godfather who will know what he needs."" Remus says. ""One who's lived his circumstances already and knows how to make sure he'll want for nothing. And you'll have everyone there with you too. Like your mother's said -- none of us ever left. We're just selectively invisible.""

""Very funny."" Harry sniffles, then laughs wetly. ""I'm tired of looking at you, so go invisible again."" He swallows hard. ""I've, uh, I've got to die, now. That's how this ends. I don't know how much you know. If you know."" He looks around the group slowly, as if drinking the moment in. ""I'll be with you soon, I think. Hopefully he goes down without me."" He manages a wan smile. ""I just... when I get there, I'll be where you are, right?"" There is hope in his voice that James cannot bear to crush, so he nods. ""I can do this then."" He exhales slowly. ""I can-- I can do this.""

""We didn't want this to happen to you."" James says softly. ""None of us ever did. We didn't-- we didn't want you to have to--""

""I know, Dad."" Harry says, and James' heart breaks. ""We'd have a problem if you'd wanted me to die."" He tries to laugh and James is reminded of Sirius as a teenager, so unused to the idea of adults that wanted good things for him that he'd laughed in James' parents' faces when they'd suggested things so simple as eating more greens at dinner. ""Thank you. For loving me all this time. Can't have been easy.""

""It was."" Lily says. ""Every second, it was.""

""I'll be home soon."" Harry says, and it feels like a parody of a child leaving home, like the universe is jerking James and Lily around, strung up like marionettes. It feels like someone extraordinarily cruel wants them to hurt, wants them to cry, wants them to grieve for their son all over again, like the last sixteen years and nine months and some odd days haven't been just that in various shades. ""I love you. All of you. I have to-- I have to go now.""

""We'll be with you every step of the way."" James promises.

""You're never alone, Harry."" Lily adds her voice to the mix.

""And then you'll have us after."" Sirius says fiercely. ""For as long as you want.""

""Forever, if you want."" Remus says. ""Let's go.""

Harry drops the stone, and suddenly they are all back on the cottage floor, grabbing at each other's clothes and screaming. James is crying and Lily's eyes are burning with anger and Remus would've broken his first pounding it against the wall if they could break anything here. Sirius screams himself hoarse for longer than anyone else, the rebellion of noise all he had left to give, and runs circles around the cottage in the emptiness, searching for someone who isn't there. Who might never be there.

They promised him they would be there.

They promised him they would be there.

Instead, they wait up for that eighteen year old boy to appear, spend enough time lying in wait that they all grow irritable and Sirius has what sounds like an extremely vivid hallucination, and for weeks afterward they sleep in shifts, waiting, waiting, waiting for a teenager that desperately wanted nothing more than to be wanted by them to knock on the front door. 

James cannot look in the mirror and Lily cannot look at him and Sirius and Remus snap at each other like they are kids again, circling each other like vultures, each waiting for a sign of weakness from the other to pounce. It feels like the war again, feels like they are all being played against each other, but they are smarter this time, stronger. They know better. James learns to catch his reflection in windows without wincing and Lily's smiles come back eventually. Sirius' words eventually cocoon themselves in bubble wrap and Remus stops trying to destroy the cottage.

To Vernon and Petunia,

I didn't really want to write this letter (I wanted to never speak to any of you ever again) but Hermione and Ginny convinced me it might help me find closure or something, so here goes.

 

I'm seventeen now, so I'm not going to be returning to Privet Drive. I know you only took me in because Dumbledore insisted that it would help keep me safe, and now that the spell my mom cast with her love isn't going to protect me anymore, I see no reason to stay.

 

I've always wondered - did he Imperio you to keep me? Or was the letter he dropped off at your doorstep along with baby me charmed with something similar? He would never answer that question, and now that he's dead I'll never know. If he'd done that, I wish he would've cast something to make you treat me better, or at least to let me have a real bedroom. He claimed you took me in out of the kindness of your hearts, but I never saw kindness growing up at your house, so I don't believe that.

 

I've also wondered why you always treated me like shit. I'm tired of people treating me certain ways because of how they felt towards my parents. I think it's evident by now that I'm not James or Lily, and given that you two took me in when I was only a baby, it's not like I would've formed much a personality like theirs at that point. You could've raised me to hate them - instead, you just raised me to know that I was horrible because I was the offspring of Petunia's sister who she hated and some ""uncultured"" British-Indian man. (Thanks for implying that I can't be a real Briton due to my parentage, by the way.) I'm so glad my friends (my true family) and my girlfriend have shown me that I'm not the person you thought I was.

 

Maybe if you'd just allowed me some independence, allowed me contact with the world my parents came from, I would've grown up with less warped a self-image. Even if you couldn't contact Sirius until I was nearly an adult, you could've talked to Remus. Or even Hagrid, or Marlene. Just because my godfather was in jail didn't mean that there were no adults who would've wanted to help me.

 

But you didn't, and I had to find myself on my own.

 

Oh yeah, and I'm queer. Bisexual, to be specific. Hermione helped me figure out that it's okay to like both men and women even though I'm in a relationship, and she and Ginny have been helping me find support groups and stuff. So have fun with that knowledge, since I know Vernon liked to rant until he was red about queer people, which is probably why I didn't figure it out until I was fifteen.

 

If you ever realise how much you fucked up, or if Dudley wants to contact me (since I know he's only partially responsible for how he turned out, with parents like you) you can send a letter to 12 Grimmauld Place. One of my friends or my girlfriend will be looking at the letters before I do in case they're loaded with insults and profanity, just as a warning.

 

Sincerely,

Harry James Potter

Let's find us a Malfoy!""

""W-what? Why?! Rose-!""

Rose dragged Al, her helpless henchman, behind her (caring not a whit for his increasingly reddening face) as she shoved her way through the train corridor and all with a mad grin on her face.

""Aha! Found you!""

Al bumped into Rose's back, hurriedly catching his glasses before they fell, as she abruptly stalled. He stood on tiptoe, once again bemoaning Rose's early growth spurt, to catch a glimpse past her shoulder: a largely empty compartment with but a single well-cared for suitcase covered in stacks of books and one very startled bookworm.

 

""I'm sorry?""

""You! You're Scorpius Malfoy, right?""

""Y-yes?""

The combination of white-blond eyebrows and big circle glasses gave ""Scorpius"" a rather owl-like appearance. Al found himself liking the boy despite himself. He'd always rather liked owls. Then again, Al liked anyone who kept Rose's attention off himself.

Rose plonked herself on the seat opposing the blond and put an arm out in front of her. ""Scorpius"" carefully set his book aside.

""I'm Rose Granger-Weasley. My dad told me to beat you in everything.""

""I'm, er, Scorpius but... you know that already? Er..?""

Scorpius looked at Rose's hand as if it were a live squid. Al cautiously went to sit beside his cousin, nervously nudging his glasses up his nose, and whispered to the blond,

""It's a muggle thing. You're meant to shake it.""

Eyes narrowed suspiciously, Scorpius reluctantly moved to grasp Rose's hand. He slowly moved their hands to the left only to be interrupted by Rose cackling and shaking their hands up and down ""properly"".

""Ha! You're a funny one, Malfoy! Oi, Al! Don't be a stranger! Introduce yourself!""

Al jumped in his seat. He fidgeted with his glasses again before muttering his name, desperately trying to hide his growing nerves. He really wished Rose didn't drag him into her antics. Why did she have to be so utterly shameless?

Scorpius squinted at Al before murmuring his own name in response. The three sat staring at each other (or in Al's case, anywhere but at each other) before Scorpius said,

""Er, this is... nice and all but... why are you talking to me?""

Normally Rose would have gone immediately on the defensive but something about Scorpius' genuine confusion must have left her amicable. Rose laughed, her natural hair bobbing good-naturedly with her.

""I told you! My dad told me to beat you in everything!""

""Er, if your father's so against me... won't he be rather mad that you're sitting with me on the train?""

""Pssh! If he gets mad about it I'll just tell him I'm keeping an eye on you. 'Friends close, enemies closer', you know?""

Scorpius blinked at Rose, seemingly sincere, before shifting his skeptical blue eyes to Al. Al shrugged helplessly. He'd never really understood Rose either.

 

""Well! This has been fun! I'll be back in a jiff- just got to check on the rest of the gang. Merlin but there's a lot of us! You two play nice now, alright?""

Rose narrowed her eyes at Al. He nodded furiously.

And so, with as much bluster as she had entered it, Rose Granger-Weasley swept out of the compartment, reddish-brown curls bouncing behind her.

She graciously left her luggage behind for Al to deal with. He sighed, unsurprised.

 

Meanwhile, Scorpius was continuing his impression of a startled bird, brow furrowed, eyes blinking, mouth gaping slightly. Al took pity and decided to attempt some explanation. It seemed to be most of what he did as Rose's unwitting second.

""Rose is, um, always like that. My dad... he likes to say she's like some 'unholy combination' of her mum and mine. Sent to terrify the pox out of the Wizarding World, apparently.""

Al pulled at his plait, desperate to avoid eye contact, hoping madly that Scorpius would be satisfied with his rambling. Alas.

""Your dad... Harry Potter.""

""Um, yes.""

""Your dad, Harry Potter, famed hero of the Wizarding World and former arch-nemesis of my father, the school-yard bully?""

""Um, yes. Sorry.""

""Why are you sorry?! Shouldn't I be sorry-?""

""No! Um! I mean, my dad... he's always saying that we, my cousins and me, shouldn't try and relive his, um, his...""

""Heroism?""

""No! Um! I mean, kind of?""

Scorpius snorted. It was the most natural thing Al had seen him do since meeting him. It made Scorpius' nose go all wrinkly.

""My father barely talks about his school years. He goes all quiet and then he gives a speech about 'not giving into what other people expect from you' and 'respecting your own sense of morality'.""

Scorpius seemed to be somewhat bitter about all this.

""That sounds... kind of similar to what my dad says? I mean! Um, not really but... kind of?""

Scorpius raised an eyebrow and Al whimpered miserably. Oh, Merlin, how long was Rose going to take?

 

Scorpius coughed and attempting to change the subject.

""Er, I think your dad sends mine a Christmas card every year.""

How was that a change in subject? Al thought.

""R-really?"" Al managed. Why did Rose have to leave him alone with people? Now he was expected to talk!

""Yeah... It always makes my dad act... weirdly?"" Scorpius paused but continued upon Al's complete lack of verbal response, ""I, er, think he tries to hide them but Grandmother gets hold of them and... puts them on display. Er.""

Silence. Painful, pained, pain-inducing silence. Al fidgeted in his seat, sorely tempted to hide behind his luggage. Rose owed him. Scorpius, seemingly out of fatherly anecdotes, shifted in his seat. Al, terrified of boring the other boy, blurted the first thing to come to his head.

""Um. What are you reading?"" 

Al was glad the blond hadn't winced at Al raising his voice. Al never could rely on getting his speaking volume right.

""Hogwarts: A History!""

Now Scorpius winced, probably at his own eagerness, before continuing in a more mumbled fashion.

""Father told me a lot about the Wars last year but I wanted to see if he was really... er. I wanted to read what had happened for myself?""

Al happily ignored Scorpius' unconscious slip. Honestly, Al could relate. He wouldn't say that of course: if there was something that terrified Al more than having to talk to a stranger it was trying to bond with someone through familial insecurities. Al attempted to make a vague reply.

""Y-yeah. Dad sort of left all... that to Mum. Uncle Ron got there first though... His version of it is quite... um, dramatic. Aunt Hermione ended up telling us all afterward that it really involved a lot more standing around reciting spells and a bit less dragon slaying. And, um, less Uncle Ron saving the day singlehandedly.""

Scorpius smiled despite himself. He looked somewhat surprised to have done so and began blinking again. Al wondered if he should offer some eye drops.

Thankfully, Rose decided to make her dramatic return before another torturous silence could ensue.

 

""Merlin's beard, did you two talk at all while I was gone? Really, Al! Ugh, never mind that - I found one of the cool Weasleys!""

Rose stood to the side waving ""jazz arms"". Aunt Hermione had sent Rose along to muggle dance classes to help ""build confidence"". Al continued to blame muggle dance for inflicting him with Rose in all her grandeur. Rose hissed something to someone behind her before mouthing 'ta-da' just as a vaguely ginger Chinese girl stepped into view.

""Hello, Alby.""

""Molly!"" Al leapt up and was immediately swallowed in a hug.

""Shouldn't you be with the prefects? Oh, wow! You're already in-uniform and everything!"" Molly giggled as Al jimmied up and around their hug to take in her shiny new badge.

""I decided to excuse myself for a bit to see you, Alby. Not fair to leave you all alone with Miss ""I Have A Fantastic Idea"" over here-""

""Heard that, did you?"" Al muttered under Rose's offended gasp. Molly made a quick grin at Al before taking notice of the other occupant of the room.

""Oh! I see you've made a friend! Introduce me?""

""Um, this is...""

""Scorpius Malfoy."" The words came somewhere around the blond's shoulders as he had apparently tucked his head into his chest amongst all the hugging. Molly then proved exactly why she was Al's favourite cousin (take that, Rose!) by being a wonderful angel of mercy.

""Scorpius, huh? After the constellation?"" Scorpius nodded, tense. Molly gave him an encouraging smile

""Astronomy has always been my favourite subject. I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. The professor is very nice.""

Al noted that Scorpius' ears had out-rosed Rose. Al quickly kicked Rose (who had decided to sulk in a corner at Molly deciding to talk to Scorpius instead of her) in the shin before she could comment on it.

Scorpius, unknowingly rescued from Rose's teasing, braved further conversation with the kind older girl, voice only squeaking slightly.

""Er. Congratulations on being a prefect?""

""Oh! Thank you!"" Molly's eyes wrinkled as she laughed and Al could almost see the steam coming from Scorpius' ears. ""My parents are very proud! I hope you keep this friend, Alby! Scorpius and his manners should be an excellent influence on Rosie!""

Rose snorted but let the comment stand, likely only employing tact to save face in front of Molly. No one liked looking bad in front of Molly.

""Well, I've best go off and make sure no one other than Rose is causing mischief- don't worry, Rosie, I'm only mostly kidding! Be sure to find me at dinner, alright? I'll give you a wave! Oh, you too, Scorpius!""

""Bye, Molly,"" the three first-years chorused, Scorpius looking rather dazed.

 

Rose humphed back to her seat and flicked Al on the forehead. Darn, Al had hoped she's let his kick slide.

""Trust me to rely on you, Al! You haven't even put our luggage on the racks! Hmph!""

Al lamented how easily his embarrassment showed on his face. He was just as brown as his brother and sister yet somehow only he had inherited the Weasley tendency to go tomato. He did his best to hide his cheeks with the bangs that had once again escaped his braid.

Rose busied herself with setting the compartment to rights. Every time Al went to half-heartedly assist she tutted him away. Al gave up, feeling rather useless.

 

 

""Er...""

Ah, Al thought, the 'Molly Effect' ended.

""Yes, Malfoy?""

""You really don't need to call me that... er, Rose.""

""Sorry, Scorp! Got a bit used to Dad going all 'last-name basis' when talking about you and yours.""

""Right..."" Beneath his breath, Scorpius muttered something along the lines of, ""Scorp? Really?""

""Well, come on, Scorp! Out with it!"" Rose stomped in emphasis.

""Doesn't your family mind?!""

""Mind? Mind what? I thought we went over the Malfoy thing already. All I have to do-""

""No! Not that, er. Doesn't your family mind that...""

Al finally got at what Scorpius was skirting around.

""That Molly's in Slytherin?""

""Yes!"" Scorpius said, relieved not to have to ask the question himself, still somewhat pink in the ears.

Rose stepped back from the luggage rack, humming. That always meant she was taking something seriously.

""Well, there was a lot of fuss at first. Not from Cousin Molly's parents but from Dad and Uncle George. Aunt Ginny was a bit iffy too. A few others- I only know this second-hand of course, bit before my time, you understand.

""Uncle Percy - Molly's dad - well, he was always a bit of a black sheep for the family. Some tiff during the War, I think. Anyway, Uncle Percy was all about being supportive of Molly. Her mum too - was a Ravenclaw - so that's obvious enough. Mum took Molly's side too - she's always got a soft spot for underdogs - and it was a bit of a row for a while until Uncle Harry had his say.

""He mentioned you, actually, Al! You know your dad - always keeping to himself until he's suddenly all serious. He went and brought up your middle name - Al's is Severus, like Severus Snape, one of the headmasters during the War? Unfortunate, I know - and how Uncle Harry thought that if the Potters and Weasleys and all the other Gryffindor families had been less judge-y about the whole Slytherin thing, maybe Snape and some of the other Slytherins wouldn't have turned out so... difficult? I think? Then something about house rivalries fuelling sides in the War... I'm pretty sure at least half of what he said was stuff he'd sponged off Mum...""

Al had stiffened at the mention of his infamous middle name until he'd realised that his dad had meant what he'd said about not telling anyone else about his Sorting. What with Al's brother being the apparent reincarnation of Granddad James and his little sister being, well, a little sister, Al had never felt all that... special at home. Knowing that he and his dad had a secret, just between them? Well, it had done more for his confidence than he'd realised. He was a bit surprised to hear that Uncle Percy had been so supportive though. Just another example of Uncle Ron being an unreliable source of information, Al supposed.

""Anyway, Uncle Harry's little bit settled it and then Grandma Molly - that's who Molly's named after - put her foot down and said that 'A Weasley's a Weasley no matter what colours they're wearing'! So it ended up that it was all sort of sorted - heh, sorted - before the family had even owled Molly back!""

""Wow.""

""Yeah! Exciting, right?""

""I guess? I just... I hope my family will be as accepting. If I don't get sorted into Slytherin, I mean.""

""Oh! Is your dad hassling you about it? I know my dad was still trying to do the whole 'Join us on the Gryffindor side!'-thing.""

Al winced at Rose's awful impersonation of her father. For some reason she always made Uncle Ron sound a lot shriekier and menacing than he was.

Scorpius surprised them by shaking his head.

""Actually, I think Father would be fine with it. It's just my grandparents I worry about. I just don't want to disappoint them.""

They all went solemn then. Grandparents were serious. Al wasn't sure how he would cope if he ended up being the only Weasley without a sweater on Christmas. Being without a jumper from Grandma was almost worse than being disowned! Rose nodded to herself, likely thinking the same thing Al was thinking, before jumping to her feet.

""Well! That was depressing! Why don't we play a game to cheer ourselves up?""

Al nodded eagerly: anything to avoid having to do more talking. Scorpius made a weak smile before saying,

""As long as it's not Exploding Snap. I'd like to keep my eyebrows intact on my first day of school, thanks.""

That got a smile out of everyone and Al relaxed. Perhaps he wouldn't have to suffer Rose's tyranny alone this year. In fact, having Scorpius around would mean Al would have another human to hide behind when James (inevitably) tried to challenge Rose for leadership of the younger Weasleys!

Perhaps Hogwarts wouldn't be too awful after all."

Great Hall, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Scotland







31
st
 June 2025




Padma Patil, former Ravenclaw prefect and daughter of the Indian Magical Ambassador, was happy. Her fiance, Ravenclaw Head Girl Rose Granger-Potter, was graduating today and Padma had been invited to it by her.

Today was also a first for the British Wizarding Nation as it would be the first marriage allowed on this day between two witches, making Padma excited.

It was all thanks to a campaign led by her future father-in-law and fellow classmate, Harry Potter, the Minister of Magic. He, along with his wife, Hermione Granger, had spearheaded the creation of a 'Marriage for All Act', a law created in order to allow the joining of not just heterosexual, but also homosexual couples in matrimony.

Padma remembered how she had first met Rose. She had attended a Weird Sisters concert two years ago and it was there that she first met the bushy haired teen. They swapped Floo addresses and had been seeing each other for a year, before Albus Potter, Rose's half-brother, found out about the couple.

Rose and Padma talked to their parents, admitting their love for each other and initially Rakesh Patil, Padma's father, refused to allow her to continue in the relationship, but Padma won out in the end.

As the graduation speeches ended, Padma looked into the chocolate brown eyes of her lover and smiled, knew that she was happy. As the Minister for Magic rose, Padma heard the reason for him to rise and was ready to be called by him.

""Today we call for Miss Rose Granger-Potter and Miss Padma Patil to come forth in order to celebrate their union together."" Harry said, smiling at his future daughter-in-law and his daughter.

Padma saw her fiance smile, kissing her on the lips in front of the assembled students, staff and dignitaries. Who knew that the two of them would be Ravenclaw students who were happy together."

The snow drifts reached almost up to the knees of Regulus Black as he struggled to keep up with his older sibling on the poorly kept cobbles of Nocturn Alley.



Christmas shopping with the Carrows were a tradition designed by their mother and father to get the two Black children out of Grimauld Place to allow Kreacher to decorate the place to Walburga's preferences. The place would look beautiful when they returned later that afternoon, Regulus knew. It would be filled with garlands of holly and evergreens, ribbons and candles; a Christmas tree, hung with candy canes, beaded peacocks made with real feathers and strings of pearls. There would be presents under the tree - books, fine robes, maybe toys, and cards with brand new galleons spellotaped to the insides.



 Regulus was snapped out of his thoughts of hot butterbeer and tinsel when his winter boot slipped on a wet patch of snow, whipping it out from underneath him and sending him headlong into the snowy street. The cold and wet of it, the sudden immersion, shocked him, and he cried out for his sibling. 


 


""Siri!""


 


Sirius Black was walking a few paces behind the two Carrow youths - twin sister and brother, Alecto and Amycus - their hands shoved deep into the pockets of their winter cloak, and their hat pulled down over their forehead in a bid to hide their mullet of a haircut, as well as a yellowing bruise above their left eye.



 All three stopped and turned around to find Regulus sprawled out in the muddy snow-slush, covered head to toe in the freezing slurry. The Carrows giggled gleefully into their mittens as Sirius turned on their heel and marched back to pull the boy up by his wet sleeve, his bottom lip quivering, bare hands turning red with cold.


 


""You are in trouble now, little Reggie,"" cackled Alecto.


 


""Walburga is going to whip you for messing up your robes,"" Amycus agreed.


 


Regulus' eyes went wide with fear, as he stared at the two, then at Sirius, who was doing their best trying to brush the snow and dirt off the front of their brother's wet robes.



He looked so scared, and it hit Sirius like a bludger to the heart.



They had already cried themselves to sleep together in Sirius' bed four days ago.



 That afternoon they had played hide and go seek, when Regulus had broken a crystal cup while climbing into a cabinet to hide, in the formal reception room. Sirius had taken the blame, and the punishment, but Regulus had cried the hardest. Sirius hadn't even bothered to put dittany, or even ice, on their eye, instead they had taken their little brother straight to their bed, where they held him while he cried until he fell asleep.



Then they themself had cried, in silence, gently stroking their little brother's hair, until they too fell asleep. 



 Now they crouched down and placed both hands on Regulus' shoulders, locking eyes.


 


""Reg, look at me, no she is not, don't worry about it, come on.""


 


They swivelled on their heels, gesturing for the boy to climb on their back, and he obeyed, stifling a sob, as he wrapped his arms around his older sibling's neck. Sirius in turn wrapped their arms around each of his legs, and pushed themself up, stumbling once, twice, before finding their balance, and kept heading up the street towards Diagon Alley.



 The two Carrows let them catch up to them, then fell into step on either side of them.


 


""Where are we going?"" Amycus asked.


 


""To the Leaky Cauldron.""


 


""What good is that going to do?"" Alecto inquired.


 


Hiking the sniffling Regulus up higher on their back, Sirius sighed.


 


""Get warm and dry, for one. You coming?""


 


""It's 'are you coming', 

for one

,"" Amycus muttered under his breath, but shuffled, albeit grumpily, after the Black siblings together with his sister.


 


***


 


The windows at the Leaky Cauldron were fogged up with the condensation from dozens of wet winter cloaks drying on warming bodies in the heat of the blazing fireplace, filling the air with the smell of wet wool and leather, as well as mulled wine and roast. It was crowded with Christmas shoppers and their bulging bags, their squawking owls and babbling children. Goblins and wizards alike were huddled around tables full of pints and pub-grub, illuminated by lamps and Christmas lights alike.



 The four children pushed their way towards the bar, where Tom, the landlord, was chatting away with his patrons.



Sirius put Regulus down on an unoccupied barstool and looked around for a familiar face, any familiar face would do, at this point. Fortunately, Merlin must have been smiling down upon them, because just then they spotted a face they would recognise anywhere; across the bar, a tall bespectacled wizard raised his hand to flag down Tom in the hustle and bustle, tufts of his dark, thick hair sticking up in all directions after having worn a hat all morning. Fleamont Potter's likeness to his son was uncanny - or his son's likeness to him was, Sirius supposed they should say - except for James's dark complexion and the bend in his nose, which he had clearly inherited from his mother.



 Sirius had always liked the elder Potters, and right now they were happier than ever to see them. Heaving themself up on the bar, leveraged on straight arms and leaning in past the other patrons, they called out:


 


""Mr Potter! Mr Potter, sir!""


 


Fleamont scanned the bar until his eyes met Sirius'. Immediately his face lit up, and he waved, before turning around to talk to someone else over his shoulder. When he turned back around he gestured for Sirius to come over, pointing to indicate that corner of the bar, where, presumably, there was a table.



 Sirius hopped back down onto the sticky floorboards and helped their brother off the barstool, turning to the Carrow twins:


 


""You coming?""


 


Alecto and Amycus crossed their arms in perfect unison.


 


""You know,"" Alecto started, ""those no-good blood traitors you call friends are making you common, you can tell from the way you speak.""


 


""No wonder your parents are ashamed of you,"" Amycus continued, ""socialising with half-bloods and mudbloods, acting like a poofter...""


 


""Watch it, Carrow!"" Sirius bit back, ""the Potters are part of the Sacred Twenty-eight, just like you and I.""


 


""So are the Prewetts.""


 


""And the McKinnons.""


 


""And the Weasleys.""


 


""That doesn't stop them from being blood traitors.""


 


""They are blood traitors, Lupin is a half-blood and Evans is a mudblood.""


 


Stepping in front of Regulus, putting themself between him and the Carrows, and angling him away from the two blondes, Sirius leaned in and hissed through their teeth:


 


""Look, you blast-ended skanks, you want to talk about blood? Snivellus Snape is a half-blood too, you don't seem to mind his greasy beak up your arse eight days a week. And keep my friends' names out of your mouths if you know what's best for you.""


 


The superior grin on the twins' faces did not falter as they gave each other a smug look, unfazed by both the name they'd been called, and the threat levelled against them.


 


""Oh, don't you worry your pretty little head about Severus Snape,"" Alecto smirked. ""What he lacks in blood-status, he makes up for in other ways, just ask Mulciber next time you see him.""


 


""And as for your little friends, us 

talking

 about them will be the 

least

 of their problems, before long,"" Amycus added, the same malevolent mirth playing across his face. ""So get your act together, Black, and do it quickly, if 

you 

know what is best for 

you

.""


 


The three stared each other down for a moment, neither of them willing to concede, to break away first.



 But their face-off was settled for them by the arrival of Fleamont Potter, who had made his way through the crowd when Sirius failed to appear at their table. All four children flinched at the sudden voice from above them:


 


""Sirius, where ever did you go?"" Then, ""Gosh, there are more of you! Hello there, Carrow, I presume?"" He held out his hand to the two, and to Sirius surprise, and, frankly, amusement, they both took it. They bowed and curtsied, mumbling greetings and wishes for a happy Christmas, before excusing themselves, and disappearing into the crowded tavern.



 Fleamont watched them leave, somewhat perplexed, then turned to Sirius, and the now shivering Regulus standing beside them, holding onto their arm.


 


""Are they not joining us?"" He asked, but upon seeing the state of the younger Black's robes he seemed to forget about them instantly.



""Oh dear, what in Merlin's beard has happened to you, young man?""


 


***


 


At a cosy table near the far corner of the Leaky Cauldron, with a bench seat against the wall, Euphemia Potter and her son, James, welcomed the addition of the two siblings. In fact, they had already bought a round of hot butterbeer, which was now sitting on their table, waiting as well.


 


""We seem to be in need of some clean-up,"" Fleamont announced, gesturing to the youngest of them.



It was then that Regulus finally started to cry, turning to bury his mucky face in Sirius' scarf.


 


""

Mama

 is going to flay us!"" Came a muffled whimper. 


 


 Euphemia was on her feet immediately, putting her arm around Regulus' shoulders and steering him towards their table.


 


""

Oh pyaare

! 

Oh

,

 bachche

, 

roo mat

... 

Roo mat

..."" And with a wave of her wand she had cleaned him up; with another, dried his robes, and with a third, done the same for Sirius, who was indeed quite wet and dirty themself after carrying their little brother.


 


 Soon, the three Hogwarts students were sitting on the bench seat, Regulus fitting comfortably between his sibling and their friend, sipping their butterbeer and chatting happily.



 He was ashamed about having cried in front of the Potters, Sirius knew.



Despite being favoured by their parents, Regulus felt the oppressive terror as much as Sirius did, but whereas Sirius pushed back, Regulus buckled. He both looked and acted younger than he was. After all, there were only two years between them, but, as Sirius had had to grow up fast to protect their brother, Regulus had become somewhat stunted.



 But sitting in-between themself and James in the warm glow of the decorated  tavern, he seemed to come to life; chatting animatedly, cheeks rosy, smile wide, eyes bright. James, too, seemed to enjoy himself. He didn't treat Regulus like a little child, he talked to him like an equal, more so, even, than Sirius did.



If they could just stay like this forever - warm, content, safe, happy...


 


""So, boys, when are you meeting up with your mother and father?"" Euphemia asked, shattering their dreamy pondering at once.


 


Their mother and father. They had lost the Carrows a long time ago, finding them now would be hopeless, if they were even still in Diagon Alley.



They were meant to Floo home from Borgin and Burke's at five o'clock, no earlier, no later. As long as Alecto and Amycus didn't tattle to their parents, maybe they would get away with it...



It certainly was a good sign that neither Walburga or Orion had yet shown up to flog them right then and there, that meant that the Carrows had not, yet at least, told their parents of their exchange, and subsequent departure.



But now Sirius' blood ran cold.


 


""What time is it?""


 


Fleamont reached into his robes and took out an ornate pocket watch.


 


""Five ten,"" he declared. ""Have you finished your Christmas shopping? If not, you have less than an hour before things close around here."" 


 


""SHI--!"" Shooting out of their seat with such force that they rattled the tabel Sirius clapped both hands over their mouth to stop themself from swearing. ""Reggie, we've got to go, grab your cloak, 

now

!"" They turned towards the bar, ""Tom, Floo powder, now, 

please

!""


 


Regulus flew out of his seat, swinging his cloak over his shoulders in the process and practically leaping towards the fireplace while Sirius rushed to the bar, flanked by James, ready to help if he could.


 


""Hey, hey, hey! Lads, what's going on?"" Fleamont stood up, gesturing, with the palms of his hands facing the floor, for the frantic teenagers to calm down.


 


""We're late, Sir, and we'll be in trouble if we don't hurry home,"" Regulus explained, with only a fraction of vibrato in his voice, hopping from one foot to the other in front of the fire.


 


Before any of the elder Potters could get another word in, the older boys pushed past the table with a clatter of chair legs and winter boots on the floorboards.



James pushed a handful of Floo powder into Regulus' hands and gave the boy a one-armed hug, then he hugged Sirius and wished them good luck.



With that, the Black siblings turned to the roaring flames, threw the Floo powder down, took each other's hands and stepped into the fireplace, calling out:


 


""12 Grimauld Place!""


 


And with a rush of green sparks they were gone.


 


***


 


The countryside outside of Woking was much colder than the city of London. Here, the snow lay mostly undisturbed over the fields and hills, save for the tracks and trails of creatures great and small that crisscrossed the land.



It was dark now, the sky thick with snow-heavy clouds, only illuminated in parts of the horizon by the yellowish light from the cities beyond. Occasionally there were twinkles of light from neighbouring farms and cottages, appearing as mere fairy lights in the distance, from where Euphemia was standing, by the tall front room windows.



She was holding a large cup of tea with both hands, watching how the strands of steam rising from it condensed on the cold glas, when movement in the reflection of the sparsely lit room caught her eye and made her turn around.



Her son was standing in the door, a deep furrow between his brows.


 


""

Pyaare bachche

, what's on your mind?"" 


 


Smiling warmly, she held out her hand towards the boy, beckoning him to come to her.



He obeyed, letting his mother put her arm around him as he joined her by the window. She continued:


 


""Are you worried about your friends?""


 


James made a noncommittal noise in the back of his throat by way of an answer, so Euphemia continued:


 


""They are nice boys. Are their parents... nice, as well?""


 


""You know of the Black family..."" James supplied.


 


His mother sighed loudly and turned to face him, pinning him with that knowing look only mothers learn to perfect.


 


""James, 

main ek bevakooph nahin hoon

, I saw the bruise on Sirius' face, and I know fear when I see it, and those boys were terrified. 

Mujhe batao

, are their parents hurting them?""


 


""Mom, you can't tell anyone!""


 


""That's a 'yes', then?""


 


""They don't hurt Reggie, but they can get very angry, Sirius takes the brunt of it, but please don't get involved, it'll just make it worse.""


 


""

Bhagavana

, James, that's not right!""


 


""I 

know

, mom!""


 


They were raising their voices now, and the escalating commotion finally reached the ears of Fleamont, who appeared in the door, with a tray of mulled cider and bakewell tarts, now demanding to know what on earth they were fighting about.


 


""Darling, you know what these old English pureblood families are like, we might indeed make it worse by interfering,"" he admitted, once the others had filled him in on their discussion.



He set the tray down on the side table between the armchairs, taking a seat, as well as a glass mug of cider, stirring it slowly with a cinnamon stick. 


 


""Sirius is a good lad, and his little brother is a delight, and so polite, but I know Walburga and Orion, and I think James is right - upsetting this particular apple cart may have repercussions beyond that of the safety of the two Black brothers. Honey, please.""


 


Euphemia was rubbing her forehead above the eyes with the thumb and forefinger of one hand, pacing up and down in front of the fireplace and muttering under her breath in Hindi.



 However, upon seeing the look on her husband's gentle face, she sighed with resignation, and returned his loving look.



He held out a mug of cider towards her, and she took it, taking a seat herself in the second armchair and taking a sip of the warm, fruity potion.


 


""Fine,"" she gave Fleamont a sideways glance over the rim of her mug, ""but we're extending a standing invitation to both of those boys. They can visit any time, without prior notice.""


 


""With permission from their parents,"" countered Fleamont, raising his cider, index finger extended, to make his point.


 


""And they can stay the night,"" added Euphemia.


 


The two Potters smiled at each other, and both raised their mugs in agreement.



 Fleamont turned to James, who had been sitting on the rug in front of the fireplace with his own mug of cider, watching his parents talk for the last half hour, thinking in silence.


 


""Jamie, my lad, will you write to Sirius in the morning, please, and let him know?""


 


""Sure,"" the boy nodded, and after a beat of hesitation he added: ""But there's something you probably should know...""


 


His parents exchanged a look, both furrowing their brows as they turned back towards him to let him continue.



 James took a deep breath, he wasn't sure how to explain this to his ageing parents, but if they were to offer Sirius a safe place where they could take refuge, then he wanted to make sure that the Potter estate was just that - safe - so he pressed on:


 


""Mom. Dad. Sirius is not a boy, or a girl...""


 


***


 


Lyall and Hope Lupin had built their little house themselves about eight years ago, deliberately off the beaten path, in the Welsh countryside.



 It was quiet, save for the birds, chirping in the garden around the birdfeeder, and the occasional motor vehicle passing on the distant highway.



 Remus pulled the duvet off his head, hair in an impressive disarray even for him, to find himself bathed in the golden light of a sunbeam, the dust in the air glittering around him like a strange and unfamiliar spell. It had pierced through his dream, where he had been on the Hogwarts Express with his friends, just as it sped out of a tunnel into the bright September sunshine. In the dream he had been asleep in his seat while his friends were all laughing and talking around him, and much like right now in his bed, the sun had woke him up as it suddenly shone in his face. Just before he woke, he saw, in the seat across from his dream-self, Sirius laughing at something one of the others had said. Their hair was long, past their ears again, and pulled back from their face with clips. They turned towards him, still smiling brightly, and said something...



Remus wasn't sure whether he'd just not heard what they'd said, or if he'd woken up before they said it, but whatever it was, it was gone, and the rest of the dream was fading fast.



 Somewhere downstairs he could hear his mother moving around, and the faint sound of Christmas songs on the radio.



He flopped onto his back on the bed with a sigh. They always let him sleep in, in the days after the Moon, but, given the Sun's position in the sky, it must be more than time to get up. He closed his eyes again and tried to recall dream-Sirius' face. He wondered if their hair really would have grown out that much over the winter break, and if they would really look that happy and healthy in a week's time when they'd all meet up on Platform 9 3/4 . Their many letters, notes and cards hadn't suggested any further spontaneous make-overs at the hands of Mrs Black, but given her famously unpredictable temper, that could still change in a week.



He wondered how many letters Marlene had received. Had they been writing sickly sweet love letters to each other every day?



 Remus groaned and threw his duvet off the bed, giving it a kick as he used the momentum to lever himself up into sitting on the bedside.



It was cool in the room despite the bright sunlight, and he slipped a pair of long woolly socks on before sticking his feet into the threadbare slippers by his bed. Before he left his room he also pulled a too-big jumper over his head on top of his pyjamas to lock in some of the warmth from his bed



 James would have gotten letters from Sirius every day, they were inseparable, more like twins than friends, but he'd never reflected over the frequency of their correspondence like he now did with regards to Marlene, and it bothered him. He'd always considered her a good friend, but the last couple of months he found himself irrationally annoyed by the mere mention of her. 



Once again, he was being unfair, and he didn't like this side of himself. It added another layer to the shame he already felt. So he bypassed the bathroom, with its mirror, and went straight downstairs. 


 


Hope looked up from her papers, when he walked into the kitchen, and smiled.


 


""Morning

, cariad

, 

ffansi paned

?""


 


""Please,"" he smiled back at her, but immediately flinched and sucked a breath in through his teeth.


 


A fresh, deep slash trailed down the side of his neck, under his ear from his cheek. Instinctively, he raised his hand to touch the burning cut. It was going to scar, he was sure of it. Another reason to avoid the bathroom mirror.



 His mother made a sound of sympathetic pity, leaving the kettle on the cooker to take his hand off his face, but he ducked out of her reach.


 


""Let me look, del,"" she scolded, but he pushed her hand away when she tried again to reach for him.


 


""It's fine, mum, leave it.""


 


Hope looked unconvinced, perhaps even hurt by his rejection, but she sighed in resignation and appeared to let it go, at least for now. Instead, she poured a large mug of tea and placed it on the table for Remus.



While he sat, she topped up her own mug and fetched a bottle of milk from the fridge.


 


""Did you sleep well?"" Hope tried again.


 


""Yes, thank you,"" Remus felt guilty for not letting his mother tend to his wounds, but on balance, he felt like a burden for having inflicted them in the first place. There was no winning this internal battle he was fighting. He pressed on, hoping to talk about anything else but himself and how he was doing:


 


""What are you grading?""


 


Hope had taken a job as a muggle primary school teacher once he had started Hogwarts. Up until then, she had stayed home to look after him, leaving her husband to provide for the three of them with his ministerial research grant.


 


""Oh, I'm not grading, dear, these children are too young to be graded"", she took a sip of her tea, ""I'm just going over their report books for half-term"".


 


Remus stared at her. Did she think that made sense to him?


 


""What?""


 


""Hm?"" Hope looked back up from the thin notebook in which she was writing. 



""Oh! The children write these letters to their teacher, and we write back to them."" She picked her mug up with both hands, mirroring his own stance with her elbows resting on the table.



""We have books for the parents too, so that we can... talk to both parents and children, without the interruption of the other.



They aren't meant to read each other's letters, and we don't tell them what the other writes, unless there's a good reason for us to do so... it's to make sure everyone's... happy, I suppose you could say.""


 


Remus thought about it for a moment, taking another slow sip of tea.


 


""Is that... normal? Do all muggle schools do that?""


 


""I honestly don't know, 

cariad

, I've only ever worked at this one."" She smiled, her open, honest face looked content.


 


Maybe he needn't worry about being a burden to his mother.



She seemed happy, now, that he was away from home, from her, most of the time.



Maybe once he was done with Hogwarts he'd finally move away for good. They could be happy, then, his parents; they could have a normal life at last, without him around.

Greeting each other like old friends, James took Death's hand and followed. Passed over, some would say. But the ugly truth of it was...

James Potter was dead.

He opened his eyes and he was suddenly in the backyard of his childhood home. He looked around, not seeing anyone.


Did Lily make it? Did Hari?


""James."" A soft voice called out. 

James froze, instantly recognizing that voice. How he had longed to hear that voice again. But why like this?

James was terrified to turn around, knowing he wouldn't be able to keep himself together. 

He was about to say something when he felt him grab his hand. Tears immediately started welling up in James' eyes and he turned, attacking the smaller boy in a hug.

""Merlin, I've missed you."" James whispered into Regulus' hair.

Regulus beamed, ""I have as well.""

James held Reg tightly, never wanting to let go. He was terrified that once he did, Reg would disappear. Vanish. Maybe this was all some dream, maybe-

Regulus pulled back and cupped James' cheek, ""You've gotten older."" He teased.

""You haven't aged a day."" James said back.

Regulus smiled sadly, ""Yeah... that happens.""

James snorted, ""Still cynical, even in death.""

""Oh, you know it."" Regulus nodded.

James admired Regulus. He still had those beautiful, stormy eyes, gorgeous curly hair and a smile that could light up any room.

""So this is the Potter mansion huh? Didn't think I'd have to see it like this."" Regulus said, a sad smile on his face. 

""Yeah. I've always loved it here. Lotta good memories."" James reflected. ""Where were you before?"" A smirk crept onto Regulus' face and he grabbed James' hand. The familiar feeling of apparition overwhelmed James but...softer. They materialized on the rocky bank of a crystal clear river shimmering in the sun. Regulus had a wide smile on his face and led James over to a rope swing hanging off a large oak tree. 

""Here, I'll push you!"" Regulus said excitedly. James walked around the swing and took a seat on the wooden plank, gripping the frayed rope. Once he was situated Regulus ran forward, running out the front, and taking his place back behind james. He whooped with glee as he soared through the air. It was pure bliss and for a moment things were joyous and he felt free. 

After a few more swings he dragged his feet on the bank and hopped off the swing. Regulus was still smiling brightly. 

""Sirius and I used to come here, when we were little. It stopped after he..."" Regulus shook his head out. ""It's been nice to be back here."" 

James nodded in understanding. He knew all about Sirius running away, having housed him. He took Regulus' hand and kissed it, ""It's brilliant.""

Regulus turned and looked at James, smiling. His eyes darted down to James' lips and a small blush appeared on his cheeks.

James noticed the look and nodded a confirmation. He leaned in slowly, heart beating fast. He had waited for this moment since forever. He was finally able to be with the love of his life again.

They were millimeters apart and...

It all started to fade away.

James' eyes widened and he started to panic, ""Reg?""

Regulus was disappearing and.... Oh fuck, oh fuck.

""Regulus, no!"" James cried out, tearing up again. This couldn't be happening.

Soon, he was in a field of flowers. James looked around in front of him, not being able to see Regulus, but then...

""James?"" A feminine voice said. 

James spun around quickly and there was his wife. His wife.

""Lily... oh... oh no, Lily."" James' world was burning around him. Lily was dead. Hari was defenceless, alone with...

He was interrupted by Lily rushing at him and tackling him into a hug.

""Hari lived."" Lily said, tearfully. ""Our boy is okay.""

""I... wh-what?"" James was overwhelmed. He didn't know how to react to anything. Was he to be in despair about being ripped away from Regulus? Worried that his wife was dead? Happy that Hari was alive? He felt lightheaded. Can you feel lightheaded in death?

Next thing thing he knew, everything was black.

James opened his eyes and there stood Death in front of him.

Death was cold. Commanding. Fearing.

Death was death.

""Why? Why do you play such a cruel trick on me?"" James asked, unusually calm.

Things work differently here. A voice said, seeming to come from nowhere.

""How? Is my wife dead? Can I see Regulus again? Is Hari-""


Hari is well. Distressed, but alive.


That eased James. At least that was real. ""What about Lily? Was that real?""


Lily is dead. She died protecting your son. She is what saved him.


James closed his eyes. Lily was real as well.

""And... and what about Regulus?"" James said.


What about him?


""Is... why... can..."" James didn't know what to ask.


Soulmates, dear James. When one dies, they are sent to their soulmate. Regulus has waited to be reunited with you.


""Then why was I sent to Lily?""


You are Lily's soulmate.


James was confused. Regulus was his soulmate, but he was Lily's? It didn't make sense.


You may see him again. You may visit whoever you like. But once you are ready, you will rest. You will be in peace.


""You mean this isn't it. This isn't the end?"" James asked.


Not until you decide that it is the end.


""Can... Can I be with both of them?"" James asked. 

Death raised his hand and suddenly, James was back in the field, two faces staring down at him.

""Bloody idiot's only reaction to things is passing out.""

""I know. He passed out when we found out you died.""

""I saw that."" A laugh.

""You saw- oh wait, he's opening his eyes.""James blinked a few times, and a worried Lily and Regulus were peering down at him. Regulus offered him a hand up and Lily immediately peppered him in questions and a kiss to the cheek. 

""I was worried for a minute!"" She said, now smiling softly. ""Hari's alive, love. And we're both...together."" Even in death her optimism shone through. ""And here nonetheless! I used to come here with Pet and mum and dad. We'd camp here."" 

""That's lovely. Want to have a look around?"" James asked, extending a hand. Lily smiled but shook her head. 

""I want to look for a moment. Just remember."" She said. James nodded. And Regulus, nodded just so, smiling at Lily. She walked off into the field and Regulus turned to James. They both spoke at the same time. 

""I talked to death-""

""James-"" Regulus blinked at him. ""Well you have the floor."" He said incredulously. 

""I talked to death, and we're soulmates. But Lily's my soulmate too."" he finished. Regulus nodded. 

""I know."" He gave a sad smile. James wasn't sure what to say. He couldn't well choose between his first love and his last. Luckily Regulus picked up. ""Choose her.""

""But-""

""You won't decide James. So I'm telling you to choose her. Don't get hung up on me. I'll still be here. But it's you two."" James reached out to put a hand on his arm but Regulus stepped back. He sighed, eyes darting up at James again and he gave him a quick and tight hug. 

""I want you to be happy. And you'll have that with her."" He said in only a whisper, but the words reverberated in James' ear. He understood. 

Regulus loved him. 

James nodded, ""Will I see you again?""

""Of course. I'm gonna be annoying you for eternity. It's my job now."" Regulus grinned.

""Dork."" James laughed.

""You know it."" Regulus said quieter. He looked back at Lily who was still exploring. ""Go be happy, James.""

""I love you, Reg.""

Chapter 1


 


Dhatura Lily Potter supposed she should have seen all of this coming. She 

seemed

 to have the worst luck in the world, and the weirdest things just

 seemed

 to happen to her, all on their own.


 


It wasn't her fault, at least she believed so. She never asked for any of this to happen, she couldn't control any of it. She knew she was just a little girl, and it all just plain sucked.


 


Her life, as long as she could remember, had been utter shite. As if her parents being dead, and living with the most awful family in England wasn't enough, now she was left behind and homeless on the bloody streets of London. 


 


She knew she was odd, but no one deserved this. These 

things

... they just 

happened

 and it wasn't like she could control it. This time, it had cost her food and a home to live in, not that the Dursley's was any sort of home for her.


 


See, when Dhatura's parents had died, she had been left upon the doorstep of her aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon. Aunt Petunia had been her mother's sister, and so responsibility had been handed to them. In kind, they reluctantly took her in, which was evident in how they treated her, and especially when Uncle Vernon was incensed enough to hurt her, which wasn't exactly rare. 


 


To them, she was a burden risen up from the highest evils of hell and she was handled as such. Despite having several other spare rooms in their spacious suburban paradise, she was shoved to the cupboard underneath the stairs, to live with the spiders and dust. She was hardly ever given much, so the only things that had resided in her box was her mandatory school uniform, dyed grey hand-me-downs from her cousin, books given to her by sympathetic teachers and a worn blanket and pillow. 


 


As a young child, she'd had no idea this was abnormal, until she truly thought about the differences between her and the precious Dudley Dursley, and why they so despised the girl's very presence.


 


Well, for one, she wasn't white. Her father, as much as she could figure, was of Indian descent , considering her Aunt Petunia, who never spoke a word about her parents, was as pale as the moon above, she guessed her father was of Indian heritage or something close to that. 


 


It also had to do with all of the weird things that had happened to her throughout her short lifetime. For example, when she was left at their doorstep, she also came with a scar on her forehead, in the shape of a lightning bolt and unnaturally green eyes. Dhatura thought it was rather cool looking, but the Dursley's believed it was grossly abnormal for a little girl to have a scar, and it was therefore labeled ""ugly"" and her aunt forced her to hide it behind unruly black bangs. 


 


Then one time, Dudley, her cousin, had stuck gum into her hair, to which Petunia then cut her hair into a horrid bowl cut that refused to stay flat. As much as Dudley had laughed and she had cried that night, it had miraculously grown back overnight after having an amazing dream about a flying motorbike and a giant friendly black dog. Dhatura had thanked whatever god or goddess that had answered her prayer. Then again, she had also gotten locked in her cupboard for a week without food privileges. 


 


This time, however, her weirdness had come with truly dire consequences. 


 


She had been exiting her school building for the day in mid-September, after having talked with the school librarian about the Nancy Drew books that she so loved, when Dudley and his stupid gang of bullies, of which he was the leader, had begun to chase her around the school. She dove behind the trash bins just next to the kitchen door, but found herself on the roof of the school, just above the kitchens, witnessed by many of the residents in the neighborhood.


 


That's when the Dursley's and their 'bizarrely delinquent niece' had been quite literally the talk of the town. This gossip enraged them and she was pushed violently into the wall the moment she got home, and dragged by her hair into the cupboard again, listening to the harsh whispers that came from the living room for days upon days. The next few days she was lucky if Uncle Vernon would throw her a bloody apple, if anything at all. 


 


Then, there had been all of the rukus outside of her cupboard for several days in a row, thumping down the stairs multiple times a day, until everything was silent. Every once in a while, Dhatura could hear Vernon muttering ""freak"" or ""... tried to stomp it out...""


 


Then there was nothing except the fading sound of a car engine.


 


For days, no words were heard, nor the telly going off, absolutely nothing. Not even an inkling of Vernon getting too drunk and smashing glasses, or Dudley throwing a fit for more food. 


 


Panic seized her. 


 


She was trapped in a small box, and presumably left behind, at the age of 8. 


 


Instinct grabbed her. She rattled at the locked door, as tears poured down like lava released from her eyes. 


 


She thrashed wildly, like a caged animal abused for far too long. Minutes felt like years, trapped in a hell that she did not deserve.


 


After banging one last time, the door's lock cracked as it unlocked and it flew open, hitting the wall with a loud bang and caused Dhatura to jump back and flinch.


 


A few moments later when the coast seemed to be clear, Dhatura slivered her eyes open just a bit. The door had opened... but no one was there to open it from the outside... 


 


Of course, the young girl had simply chalked it up to the weird things she couldn't control and climbed out of the cupboard. She had no reason to believe it was anything otherwise.


 


The house was... empty. Not a soul or even object remained. 


 


She didn't know what to do. On one hand, the Dursleys were horrid, and she felt herself slump a little in relief. Of course, her life would look up a little bit since those vile people were gone, but she was left with so many questions. What was going to happen to the house? What did they think was going to happen to her after they left her there to die? What was she going to do? 


 


She felt confused. She supposed she had to come up with a plan.


 


All this, and she was only bloody 8 years old.


 


***



She didn't have many choices, so she went with the most sensible of them.


 


Dhatura cleaned out her school bag, which held her work and a few books to read. She kept the books, but left everything else laid out on the table of the kitchen. 


 


Then, she took all of her belongings, considering she had next to nothing anyway, and stuffed them in, jamming her ratty blanket and pillow deep next to her ugly oversized clothes from her ugly oversized cousin. 


 


What was to come next had been banking on what little luck she'd had and every bit of building karma she was owed from such a damning universe to treat her so cruelly. 


 


In the dead of night, as not to get caught by any peeping neighbor, Dhatura snuck off to Surrey Station. She knew it was useless being 'homeless' in the middle of a suburb, because most people only cared about their garden and whatever have you. 


 


She snuck around the crowded train station, stealing some crisps and a bottle of water out of a sleeping woman's purse while she slept soundly on the bench.


 


With no money, Dhatura snuck past ticket agents, and hid in the bathroom on the emptiest car, saying she was motion sick, until she ran off the train as soon as it stopped. She felt residual guilt, at the mixture of taking up the bathroom and not paying for the ticket, but she simply had no other choice.


 


She ripped out of the bathroom like a bat outta hell. Shouldering her bag, she darted straight into the dangers of London. 


 


***


 


Being homeless... was hard, but that was quite expected. 


 


Dhatura would never admit this, but as much as she hated the Dursleys, she missed being able to eat a good, solid meal, at least every once in a while, and having a roof over her head.


 


She also missed showering. That was nice while it lasted. 


 


It was a few months away from being 3 years she became homeless, abandoned and a runaway all at once. It was the beginning of June, and in a bit less than two months, Dhatura would be 11. 


 


It had been three years of survival, and she continued to count her blessings as they came, as she refused to become as bitter as Petunia had been. Wandering the streets all those years ago, she continued her brief luck streak from right off the train, and didn't die. In fact, in those months to come, she had found a small niche with a group of other homeless people, including Agnes and her 2-year old Heather, Mitchell the ex-accountant, Robert, or Raz, a kid kicked out of his house for being gay, and Akemi, an elderly Japanese woman. 


 


She took their advice and slept under a bridge underneath a motorway, keeping her mostly dry at the very least, but she was always chased away when trying to make permanent camp in warehouses. It was hardly easy. She often starved, and honestly, she was just barely surviving day to day.


 


Winters had obviously been the worst. Dhatura felt she now had a permanent chill to her bones, despite staying in the youth shelters as much as she could. 


 


But her minimal luck had yet to run out, so she was grateful for that at the very least.


 


Three years later, and not much had changed. Her little camp saw several freezing winters, but Dhatura kept in mind that she hadn't died yet and that was enough for her. And while, as wasn't quite permanently bitter, she held some resentment towards the Dursley's.


 


She slept in threadbare sleeping bags, but she had found a tiny mattress a year ago and it served as an extra cushion. 


 


Dhatura would never call it home. It helped her to survive, and kept her mostly safe, but it was hellish and dirty. She longed for a nice meal in a nice house. 


 


That day had started just like any other. The sun rose early on a summer day, and wildlife around her began stirring. Dhatura refused to move today, content to dream about a better life than she was leading today. A life with loving parents, a warm home filled with laughter, and food made with the intent to keep her safe and content. 


 


She was about to drift off to sleep again when she heard the nearby flapping of wings and a short hoot, alerting her that some bird was close. She peeked a sleepy eye open to see an open right in front of her face.


 


Spooked, she jumped and slipped out of her sleeping bag cautiously. The owl blinked up at the tiny girl innocently, and seemed to be gripping onto a piece of paper. 


 


She took a step forward.


 


The owl took a step forward. 


 


She took another step.


 


The owl took another.


 


They stared at each other down, until Dhatura slowly crouched to pick up the letter, unwilling to get any closer to this truly strange bird that acted almost human.


 


Snatching quickly, she backed away, but the owl remained blinking up at her. Fancy her, having a staring contest with an owl with too much personality.


 


Shaking her head, she looked at the letter. 


 


It read:


 



To: Miss D. Potter





The Bridge Under The Motorway





London



 


""I really don't know what this is about but it's creeping me out,"" she informed the owl in a frank tone, which irritatingly continued to blink up at her. 


 


Hesitantly, Dhatura broke the seal and opened the letter. What found was even more crazy:


 



HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY





Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE





(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)





Dear Miss Potter,





We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.





Yours sincerely,





Minerva McGonagall





Deputy Headmistress





 





HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY



 


Dhatura truly did not know what to make of this. Was this a prank from Raz? Or from some stupid group of teenagers that thought it was bloody hilarious to make fun of homeless people?


 


She didn't bother to look at the book list, as she didn't feel like dealing with that mind blowing experience. 


 


She was stunned into silence.


 


She stared at the awaiting owl and remembered that the letter had said it expected some sort of reply... She truly didn't know what to say.


 


This had to be fake... Witches and wizards? 


 


She supposed she had to answer or else the owl would probably peck her eyes out. 


 


She stepped over to her old schoolbag, and pulled out a pen she had found last week on the street outside of a fancy bank, and on the bottom corner of the first page of the letter she penned out a note.


 



Hello, is this a prank? I'm very confused.- Dhatura Lily Potter



 


She stalked back over to the owl and handed the letter off.


 


""Er- take this I s'pose?"" And the bird nabbed the letter back. Dhatura merely hoped it got back to whoever it was supposed to. 


 


***



Several months later, and it was July 31st, Dhatura's 11th birthday. She still hadn't heard from the crazy wizard school. She simply believed at this point that it was just some prank.


 


On this bright summer morning, Dhatura once again snuggled deeper into her makeshift bed and let herself have a lie-in as a small birthday present to herself. It was pretty much all she could afford anyway.


 


She felt the sun hit her from beneath her spot under the bridge and gave herself a small grin, just celebrating the fact that she was alive. She wasn't going to let this get her. She had been through worse with the Dursley's all those years ago.


 


A small but loud pop hit her ears. Opening her eyes, she found the strangest dressed woman she had ever seen, which was hard to believe, seeing as she had been living in pits of London. She felt vague deja vu and remembered this exact scenario happening the last time she had a lie in, with that bloody owl. 


 


Dhatura sat up warily and grabbed the small pocket knife for protection, upset at the disturbance of her sleep. She gazed at the woman who was stunned at the site before her. The woman was tall, emphasized by her strict posture, with greying hair pulled but into a tight bun, adorming what looked like a long dress and robe and lastly, a witch's hat straight out of the Wizard of Oz movie from decades ago. (She was homeless, not culturally unaware.)


 


""Miss... Miss Potter is that

 you

?"" The woman held a Scottish cant.


 


""I suppose yes. Who wants to know?"" Dhatura was suspicious. How could a woman simply 

appear? 



 


The woman was still taken aback, which seemed abnormal on her. ""I-I'm sorry, are you sure? Miss Potter was meant to have been living with-""


 


""The Dursleys? It didn't work out.""


 


There was a pause, whilst the woman blinked her widening eyes in pure shock.


 


All the woman said was, ""I suppose we are in for a long talk then..."" 


 


***


 


""I assume I should start with the most pressing matter outside of this situation. I am Professor Minerva McGonagall of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You, Miss Dhatura Lily Potter, are a witch.""


 



What an elegant way to begin this conversation, 

Dhatura thought to herself.


 


""Well that's an arsehole move, lady."" The disbelieving look on the woman's face was quite amusing, but the young girl believed that it was tit for tat, as she just called her a witch.


 


""Miss Potter!"" This professor had come in her, insulted her, then scolded her for her language? Lame. ""No, I meant as in, witches and wizards, and magic. You were born in a magical world, quite literally. In fact, did the Dursleys never inform you?""


 


Dhatura snorted with cynicism, but finally released the grip on her hidden knife. ""'Inform me?' They certainly didn't 'inform me' of anything, including when they abandoned me and moved out of their house, leaving me locked in the closet.""


 


If possible, the woman's eyes widened further, whilst her eyebrows grew steadily. ""I cannot believe it,"" she murmured, rage injecting into every syllable. 


 


The girl kept on. ""So no, I don't believe anyone told me of any magic."" 


 


The mysterious professor shook off her emotions, promising herself to deal with this part later. She gazed at the small girl, who was still stiffly leaning in her little cot as if to guard herself. Dhatira's dark hair was ratty and greasy, but Minerva could see evidence of her father's wild, untameable hair. Her skin, dry and scratched from the elements was naturally bronzed, also taken from her father. The child's eyes, though, were just as brilliant as her mother's, an awe inspiring emerald, yet filled with distrust for the world.


 


The girl, so young, should have been care-free, happy and innocent, but her she was, distrustful, small, and so

 skinny

. 


 


""Well, I suppose I have some convincing to do,"" Minerva stated, and gripped her wand.


 


Waving the stick, she conjured up new clothes for the girl, and offered them, almost like an olive branch. ""We have many things to discuss further, and we will, but first we must take a small trip, so you might as well clean up a bit.""


 


Glaring up questioningly, Dhatura relaxed a bit as the woman turned away for privacy. 


 


As she finished pulling the plain clothes on, including a pair of blue jeans, plain black sneakers, and a black shirt, she stuffed her pocket knife in the front pocket of the new jeans and McGonagall twirled back around.


 


""Where are we going anyway?""


 


""We are going to Diagon Alley. First and foremost, we will stop by the bank, then we shall get you some food, as you are horribly in need of a good meal, and discuss these such things further."" The professor had a stern aura around her, but seemed quite kind as she gazed down at the short girl.


 


""That sounds alright... But, miss, I don't have any money."" Dhatura was confused, she was quite obviously homeless, sleeping under a bridge. ""Obviously if I had enough money to go to school, afford meals, and all this, I wouldn't be living under a bridge like a troll.""


 


A hint of a smile winked quickly in and out of existence on McGonagall's lips. ""Yes, well, when your parents died, they left you money. I have the key with me, as Professor Dumbledore, the Headmaster, was keeping hold of it to keep it out of the Dursleys grasp.""


 


""Alright then..."" Dhatura had no idea what to say anymore. All this was happening so fast. 


 


""Give me your hand Miss Potter. We will Apparating to Diagon Alley. This will feel very odd, like being squeezed through a hole but it goes quick."" Dhatura nodded; she could handle anything.


 


Holding onto the professor's arm like instructed, Dhatura braced herself, felt the unbearable squeezing sensation, like if she was an icing bag being compressed out onto a cake. A lovely thought for a very not-lovely feeling.


 


Not even a blink later, the feeling left, and Dhatura slivered an eye open to look out at the new world around her. She had expected some magical locations, or some unicorns, anything like that, but instead they stood in front of a dank pub called 'The Leaky Cauldron.' She had passed by it a few times, but never thought much of it, as looked just like any other pub in the great city of London.


 


""No time to dawdle, let us eat and then move onto the bank. Breakfast shall be on me,"" the unbending professor proclaimed before stalking upright into the pub. 


 


Dhatura walked into a welcome sight. What she thought was going to be some normal, oddly named pub, she instead found a literally magical room. There were glasses cleaning themselves, people playing cards that exploded, and one random man stirring his coffee with a spoon whilst simply circling his finger.


 


Minerva ushered them to the seats in the middle of the floor and called over the barman with a wave. 


 


Stumping over happily, the man looked jolly as could be. ""Ah, Professor! What can I do for you today?""


 


""Yes, hello Tom, two English breakfast for me and the girl,"" she ordered patiently. 


 


""New student?"" Tom asked, only to answer his own question. ""Merlin's pants it's Dhatura Potter!""


 


McGonagall looked quite irate at the attention of the bar now focused on them.


 


""Yes, Tom quite, but we would prefer to be left alone, as we have things to discuss."" The woman was undoubtedly scary enough for Dhatura to respect her.


 


""Ah, yes sorry there Minerva, got ahead of myself, almost didn't recognize the small 'un,"" he gave her a bright smile and sod off to place the order.


 


The two sat in silence, while it wasn't uncomfortable, Dhatura had a lot of questions, even more since she had stepped foot into the pub. 


 


""Go on and ask your questions. The food will be a while anyway. You probably have a large amount so we might as well get started now, and when we go to the bookstore, load you up as to give you an understanding of this world,"" the professor said tightly, as if she desperately wished this wasn't the case. 


 


Dhatura thought for a minute about what she wanted her first question to be. 


 


""Ok, so how did that man know me? I don't believe I've ever met him, or any of the people staring at us.""


 


McGonagall looked upwards as if asking the gods to send her strength. 


 


Carefully choosing her words, the professor set out for a long story. ""Ms. Potter, to put it plainly, as a baby, when your parents were killed by a dark wizard-""


 


Dhatura interrupted her, not caring about the stern look sent her way. ""My parents were killed in a car crash. That's what the Dursleys told me. They said they were drunks and that's how I got my scar.""


 


McGonagall scowled at this. ""No they certainly were not! Magical folk are certainly stronger than that! They were killed by a dark wizard, in fact, the darkest wizard to reign in ages."" The older woman paused to gauge the young girl's reaction. 


 


""Is that how I got my scar?""


 


""Yes, as far as we know, he sent the killing spell at you, only for it to simply bounce off of you.""


 


""W-what was his name?"" She inquired hesitantly.


 


Just as hesitant, Minerva spoke softly, as to not be heard. ""His name was V-Voldemort. There is a lot of fear behind the name, so many do not speak it aloud, but I suppose you are welcome to.""


 


""So my parents died for me and I killed an evil guy with a dumb name? Better than a car crash I suppose..."" This was a lot to wrap her head around...


 


""Ms. Potter, rest assured, your parents were of the highest quality in every way possible. In fact I taught them when they were your age!"" The professor promised her. 


 


Tom brought their breakfasts to them, winking quickly as Dhatura, which gave her a small smile. No one had ever been so nice, but to have both the professor

 and 

this barman acting kindly to her, she felt it was a miracle.


 


As they ate, Dhatura processed this new information. Her parents had died, 

for her

. For so long, she had felt unloved and uncared for, but now, finding out she had had parents who loved her so much they 

died

 for her caused a deep ache inside her, longing for these parents who are praised so heavily. 


 


Finishing their food, only for the dirty plates to float away from them, the professor looked over to her future pupil.""Anything else Ms. Potter? Questions?""


 


Thinking deeply, she responded, ""I have a million questions, but I'm quite ready to meet my new world.""


 


A twitch of a smile happened upon Minerva's lips, as the woman thought 

'she ought to be a Gryffindor, just like her parents.'









          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Chapter 2 


 


Straightening herself out, the professor led Dhatura, while waving goodbye to Tom, the kind barman. Guiding her to the backdoor, the two exited the pub, only to come across a blank brick wall, with a few weeds growing out of the cracks.


 


McGonagall proceeded to bring out her wand, and tapped one of the bricks, only for the rest of them to move and form a gateway to the most amazing sight the girl had ever set eyes on. 


 


""Next time you need access from the Leaky Cauldron to the alley, just tap the third up and second across, Ms. Potter."" Dhatura nodded dumbly, too in awe of what lay before her.


 


There were people everywhere. There were shops everywhere. 


 


She saw things for potions, books, robes like the professor's, magical brooms, and so so much more. 


 


It was quite overwhelming to say the least.


 


""Well, we best be off to the bank first. While we are there I have an errand I need to do for the Headmaster, so we shall go together,"" the headstrong woman conducted. 


 


Still too taken with her surroundings, Dhatura once again nodded, which led the woman to internally smile at the girl's wondrous and curious expression.


 


They appeared before a building as white as snow, as tall as a tower, and with magnificent bronze doors. Guarding bravely, were short creatures in uniforms of scarlet and gold. Whispering down to her, McGonagall said ""Goblins."" She whispered back up the woman, ""They look like they have something shoved up their ar-"" The girl got a sharp elbow for her troubles.


 


They had clever faces, pointed beards, large scowls, and hand quite long fingers. 


 


As they approached, the goblins bowed and opened the doors to reveal a pair of silver doors, with haunting words engraved upon them spelling out:


 



Enter, stranger, but take heed





Of what awaits the sin of greed,





For those who take, but do not earn,





Must pay most dearly in their turn,





So if you seek beneath our floors





A treasure that was never yours,





Thief, you have been warned, beware





Of finding more than treasure there.



 


""Keep in mind Ms. Potter, goblins don't take well to thieves,"" she warned. But Dhatura took that as a personal challenge.


 


Entering the hall, McGonagall stalked briskly to the first free goblin available. 


 


""Good morning, we are here to take money out of Ms. Potter's vault,"" McGonagall started. 


 


""Have you got her key, ma'am?"" The goblin asked not impolitely.


 


Prepared, McGonagall brandished it and handed it over. 


 


""That seems to be in order."" And before he could continue, the professor interrupted. 


 


""I have also got a letter from Professor Dumbledore, it's about the thing in vault 713."" She seemed quite unwilling to disclose the matter in front of the young girl, or anyone else for that matter, but the goblin merely nodded. Dhatura simply minded her business for the time being, despite the exchange quirking her Nancy Drew-like curiosity.


 


""Yes, I will have someone take you both down to the vaults,"" he agreed. ""Griphook!""



A goblin, presumably Griphook, took the two through another set of doors and to a cart on a set of rails, lit only by torch light in what looked like a cave.


 


They stepped in, and the three hurtled off, as if the cart knew what it was doing without need for a guide. 


 


While her professor looked quite ruffled, and the goblin looked stoic as ever, the young Potter was whooping in her seat excitedly. It was the closest to a rollercoaster she had ever been on!


 


They stopped at a small door, pretty far down in the tunnels. Griphook got out, motioning for the girl to follow him. He unlocked the door with the key McGonagall had presented, and as the door opened, a sickly green gas bellowed out.


 


When the gas cleared, what they saw was once again another wondrous view. There was so much gold, silver, and bronze! After being told she had money set aside for her, she never imagined this much!


 


McGonagall, finally got a hold of her bearings, and swiftly conjured a large bag with the swoop of her wand, so that they could stack the coins in. ""Yes, Ms. Potter, it's all yours.""


 


Helping her put them into the bag, McGonagall explained the wizarding currency. ""The gold ones are Galleons, the silver ones are Sickles, and the bronze ones are Knuts. There are 17 Sickles in a Galleon, and 19 Knuts to a Sickle.""


 


When they were done, McGonagall climbed back into the cart, and said ""That should last you for a little while depending."" She then turned toward Griphook, ""Onward toward 713 please and thank you.""


 


They rattled onward, even passing over an underground ravine. She attempted to look over the edge, curious as the cat that got killed, only for a still flushed Minerva to pull her back. 


 


When they reached the next vault, it showed no evidence of a keyhole, but knew not to ask too many questions. Griphook simply stroked the door, and it melted away. 


 


""If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they would be sucked into the vault,"" the goblin croaked. ""Get stuck in there for 10 years before we check."" He cackled. 


 


Dhatura knew there had to be something quite eye catching for such a stealthy mission for her to behold. She took a quick peak, not being able to help her curious nature, only for it to be virtually empty except for a small brown package, which the professor pockets and climbs back into the cart. 


 


They head back the way they came on the cart, and Dhatura questioned what she witnessed. 


 


***


 


Blinking rapidly in the sunlight, she was then ushered back up the alley by McGonagall. ""Might as well get your uniform now. I have an... important owl to send to the Headmaster, but I will be back.""


 


Pushing the girl through the door, the woman then turned on a heel and marched quite aggressively towards what she assumed was an owl delivery or something similar. 


 


She hefted the heavy bag and continued fully into the shop called 

Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions

, nervous to be alone for the first time all morning in a world she hardly knew. 


 


Who she assumed Madam Malkin was a short, round woman with an extraordinarily sweet face, as if she would pinch her cheeks and hand out candies. The woman in all mauve robes smiled and said ""Hogwarts, dear?""


 


Nodding, the woman continued, ""Got a lot here, a boy just being fitted up here now!""


 


She dragged the girl to the back of the shop, where a bored looking boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a stool, while another witch pinned up his black robes. 


 


Madam Malkin stood her up on a stool next to the boy, then slipped a long black robe on her and immediately went to work, as she was quite small and skinny, so plenty of work to be done. 


 


""Hello,"" the boy said, looking around disinterested. ""Hogwarts?""


 


Dhatura gave a simple ""Yes."" She didn't like this boy so far. He seemed rude and bored which was never a good combination. 


 


""My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,"" the boy drawled with a smirk, as if proud that he got people to do things for him, the twit. ""Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing rooms. I don't see why first-years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow.""


 


She officially disliked this boy. Her mind briefly took her to 3 years ago, watching Dudley bully his parents into buying him some game consol or tellie or something. 


 


So she said nothing, but the boy still continued, not picking up the signals she was giving off to not talk to her. 


 


""Have 

you 

got your own broom?"" This boy certainly was snooty. 


 


""No,"" Dhatura snipped shortly, just trying to not get stabbed by pins in peace. 


 


The rude boy still didn't take the hint. ""Play Quidditch at all?""


 


""No,"" at this point she was quite irritable. She just discovered a new world of her own, and this boy was ruining it just a bit with his uppity attitude. She hoped not everyone in this secret community was like him.


 


Though, Quidditch sounded quite interesting, especially if brooms were involved. 


 


""Well,

 I

 do - Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked up to play for my house, and I must say I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?""


 


""No."" She felt quite stupid now. Dhatura didn't know what quidditch was, or what the houses were, and felt she was going in blind. 


 


""Well no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?""


 


""Not quite,"" she responded, ""I believe any house would be lucky not to have you."" Dhatura was quite done with his attitude. 


 


Not quite hearing her, distracted by the woman who just appeared in the shop, Professor McGonagall who looked apparently satisfied by the errands she had just run. 


 


""Well look at that woman! Looks like she ate a disgusting Bertie Botts' bean...""


 


""Ironic of you to say that, as you look like a-"" She got cut off by Madam Malkins, who accidentally stabbed her with another pin. 


 


Not processing her annoyance, the obliviously terrible boy kept on. ""Wonder who she is...""


 


""Professor McGonagall at Hogwarts."" '

Play nice', 

she calmed herself. 

'Don't make enemies right off the bat.'



 


""Oh I've heard of her. Quite a stick in the mud I've heard.""


 


""She's the deputy headmistress. And I think she's quite nice. A lot nicer than you"" Yes, she definitely did not like this boy. 


 


""Oh, 

do

 you think so?"" The boy said with a practiced sneer. ""Why is she with you? Where are your parents?"" 


 


""They're dead, not that it's your business."" All Dhatura wanted was to leave.


 


""Oh, sorry I s'pose."" He did not sound sorry in the least bit. ""But of course they were 

our

 kind, yes?""


 


Raising a dark eyebrow at the boy, ""They were a witch and wizard if that's what you mean.""


 


""I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname anyway?""


 


The words 

'Fuck off'

 were on the tip of her tongue, only for Madam Malkins to once again interrupt. ""That's you done, deary."" 


 


Dhatura was thankful for having an excuse not to talk to the seemingly racist boy any longer. 


 


The boy, of course, had to get some last words in. ""Well see you at Hogwarts, I suppose.""


 


Walking out with her professor, arms laden with more bags, she was quiet. 


 


Apparently seeing the look on her face, McGonagall questioned, ""What's wrong, Ms. Potter?"" 


 


""Professor, what's Quidditch?""


 


Looking slightly aghast, she said ""Ms. Potter I forget how much you truly don't know... Quidditch is quite a large sport for us wizards.""


 


""Please don't make me feel worse. That boy in there was quite rude about everything. He said that people from non-magical families shouldn't even be allowed in-""


 


""Ms. Potter, we call them Muggles. Non-magical people are muggles. And you are not 

from 

a muggle family, not that being from a muggle family is bad. Some of the most powerful and famous wizards and witches are muggle-born,"" the professor proclaimed. ""In fact your mother was a muggle-born!""


 


Wanting to move on from the subject, Dhatura asked ""So what 

is

 Quidditch then?""


 


""It's one of our biggest sports. It's played in the air, on broomsticks, there's four balls, and three goals on each side. Perhaps we'll get you a book?"" McGonagall said as they entered the bookstore, called Flourish and Blotts. 


 


""And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"" Dhatura questioned.


 


""They are Hogwarts school houses. There is Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin. I am the head of Gryffindor.""


 


Instead of asking more questions, the girl took to looking around the store for interesting books to help her learn more about everything she just found to be new. The shelves were so high they reached the ceilings. There was any form of book you could imagine; short, tall, big, small, odd shaped, and even an invisible book. She didn't understand how one could potentially read it but it was interesting enough. 


 


""Do you have your booklist Ms. Potter?""


 


Dhatura took it out and it read:


 



The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk





A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot





Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling





A Beginners' Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch





One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore





Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger





Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander





The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble




McGonagall grabbed a basket to hold all of the books and started picking out the books while Dhatura gazed at all of them, holding the basket as best she could as it got heavier and heavier. 


 


Thankfully, the professor also grabbed other books for the girl, remarking that they would help her adjust, or teach her more about their world. 


 


After paying and leaving the shop, they bought a trunk for her to carry her stuff, that the professor told her would always be somewhat light no matter the weight, and had some sort of extension charm in it to store a lot more. Dhatura truly loved magic. 


 


She pushed all of the stuff she had already gotten into the trunk, promising herself to sort it later, content to just not have to hold it all now. 


 


They went through the potions supply store, getting the cauldron and all of the potions ingredients required, not quite paying attention, knowing she was going to scour her books later for the information. 


 


""Just the wand left to get, then we shall see about getting you an animal. An owl, or perhaps a cat?"" Dhatura thought on it, she didn't particularly like owls, not after the last one she encountered. It could be useful, but who was she going to write? 


 


She also lived under a bridge. That was an entire problem of its own. She didn't want anything stolen... 


 


Dhatura told herself not to think about it for now, and not to ruin her perfectly amazing day.


 


They come up to a shop, narrow and shabby. The letters on the sign, peeling gold, read 

Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 B.C. 



 


They open the creaky wooden doors, and a faint ring called out somewhere deep in the shop. Looking around, there was pretty much nothing in the shop except for a single chair, and boxes upon boxes, stacked up to the high heavens. 


 


A blank room, yet it gave off what felt like the oldest magic possible, in the form of the dust and the silence that seemed to resound endlessly. 


 


""Ah, yes."" Dhatura jumped and grabbed her pocket knife in her jeans, not wanting it seen, but not wanting to be taken unaware. Neither woman had seen or heard the man approach. Before her, was an old man, pale in every single aspect, with wide blue eyes seeing through his two guests. ""I thought I'd be seeing you soon, Dhatura Potter.""


 


""Hello..."" The man was interesting but his eyes gave her the creeps. 


 


""You got the perfect mix of your parents it seems. You look remarkably like your mother, with her green eyes and her face, but your father's skin tone and raven hair... I remember their wands so well, hers being ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, willow, perfect for charms work. His was mahogany, eleven inches, pliable, with a little bit more force, which was perfect for transfigurations..."" 


 


He looked off into space. ""They chose their wands well... I say that, but the wand chooses the wizard, no doesn't it Minerva? Fir, dragon heartstring, nine and a half inches, quite stiff?""


 


""Yes, Mr. Ollivander, it's doing quite well,"" she said as she brandished her stick. 


 


Suddenly, Ollivander became rather close to Dhatura, and touched her scar with a long white finger. She preferred her personal space, but most wizards didn't seem to understand the concept.


 


""And I'm sorry to say I sold the man the wand that did this to you and your family... Thirteen and a half inches, yew. Powerful, but in the wrong hands... Well if I knew what that wand was destined to do..."" 


 


The professor spoke up, ""You are as much to blame as any of us, which is to say none. No one could stop him.""


 


""Hmmm..."" The man gave a thoughtful hum. ""Well now - Ms. Potter, let's get started."" The man started buzzing around her and the shop. ""Which is your wand arm?""


 


""Well, I'm right-handed if that's what you mean...""


 


""Hold out your arm, that's it."" He tapped the measuring tape, and it began to fly around her, measuring on its own. At one point it even had measured her nostrils. 


 


All this happened, and Ollivander grabbed boxes from the wall, seemingly at random without care. 


 


""You see, every Ollivander wand has a magical core, normally unicorn hair, dragon heartstring, or a phoenix feather, though I am known to experiment. Woods are also quite different, and each combination produces a different kind of want, depending on the size and pliability too, of course. Therefore, there is no Ollivander wand that is the exact same.""


 


Despite thinking him crazy, Dhatura thought this all quite fascinating. 


 


""Alright try this, unicorn hair, 14 inches, rowan, and flexible.""


 


She waved the wand, only for the chair in the corner to hit the wall violently. 


 


""Here, maple, dragonheart string, 8 and a sixteenth inch, sturdy,"" he said, only to immediately take the wand out of her hands the moment it touched her palm in the slightest. 


 


They tried at least 20 different wands until Ollivander said ""Ah-ha! Here we go, you may be a tricky customer but I have a good feeling about this one! Here, aspen, 12 and three quarter inches, phoenix feather, incredibly flexible... A wand for powerful revolutionaries, as aspen is known for that, and the feather is a signal for bravery ..."" 


 


Dhatura swished the wand upwards towards the ceiling, and it produced beautiful yellow sparks. 


 


""Bravo! Good, good,"" the man cheered. ""But curious... very curious..."" He wrapped the wand's box for her. ""You see, I remember every wand I have ever sold... And it just so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in that wand, also gave another feather for it's brother wand - the brother wand, in fact, gave you that scar.""


 


Dhatura blanched. 

'Of course nothing with me is that simple,' 

she said, unknowingly damning her school career into a complex mess of adventures.


 


""But the wand chooses the wizard of course... So must expect great things from you, Ms. Potter, as your wand being of aspen will lead you on many quests... After all, You-Know-Who did many great things... Terrible but great..."" 


 


She was officially creeped out, but handed the man the 7 galleons for her wand, then followed the professor out the door. 


I got done early bc i was excited to post this! Thank you all literally so much for the comments, kudos, hits, and bookmarks! This means so much to me, as a budding college writer!! 

(Also if anyone knows a good beta or is willing to beta, pls lmk... I have good writing skills but i also drink a lot of Dumb Bitch juice so...)

also i forgot disclaimers before, but I dont own anything you recognize... Im poor...

So before you read, just know that I personally am a fan of OC's, because, as long as they are done well, they can bring something new to a story, a side or an influence that wasn't in the original work. I value it, and that's why I've included one. #sorrynotsorry

Also, I'm not a fan of bashing, but I am a fan of redemption arcs, so you'll figure out fairly quickly the route that I'm going to take with Dumbledore.

Chapter 3


 


By the time they left Ollivander's it was time for lunch, as McGonagall took her back up through the alley and to the pub again. 


 


The two both ordered fish and chips, and the professor continuously opened her mouth to say something to the younger girl, only for words to apparently leave her. 


 


They got their orders, and a fresh pot of tea for the two of them. The teacups and saucers danced over to them on invisible currents of air, coming from the underneath of the bar where they were stored.


 


They ate quickly, wanting to get the rest of the shopping done in a swift manner. The chips, Dhatura resolved, were the best chips she'd ever had; better than any of the cheap chippies she had frequented whenever she got pocket money from strangers. 


 


They finished up, went through the backdoor and the bricks again, where McGonagall led her to an ice cream parlor, 

Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor. 

There were so many flavors, and so many she'd never heard of, like Pumpkin Juice and another named Butterbeer, and even one called Fizzing Whizbees Sherbert. 


 


Eventually, she chose what she had known to be good, no matter what world she was in; chocolate and peanut butter swirl, which she was told was called ""Hippogriff Swirl."" She had no idea what that meant, but was just as content. 


 


When they finally sat down after paying, outside watching the kids stare at a new broom that had just come out called the Nimbus 2000, Minerva finally spoke up.


 


""Ms. Potter, I have some news,"" the professor announced. ""I owled Professor Dumbledore, and he was as outraged as I was at your situation. It isn't... right, for lack of a better word. Even if you weren't the 'Girl-Who-Lived' as many call you, we cannot just let you live on the streets.""


 


Dhatura now had two little figures on her shoulders. One was telling her hopeful things like, 

'You may find an actual home now! Just imagine...' 

while the other hissed, 

'Doesn't matter does it? You were abandoned. No one will ever want you again.' 

She shook any stray thoughts away.


 


""Then what's gonna happen to me then? Magical foster homes? Yeah right..."" She licked her ice cream to hide her frown from the professor.


 


The professor twitched a smile, the longest one the girl had seen the entire day. ""No, Ms. Potter. Temporarily you are to live with me. I feel quite responsible."" She paused, as if to choose her words more carefully; she didn't want the young girl to resent her.


 


""You see, I was there with the headmaster when he left you on the doorstep after the happenings that night in which you were orphaned."" Dhatura winced. ""I saw what the Dursleys were like, I observed them the entire day, and thought they were quite crude.""


 



'That's one way to put it,'

 the girl thought. 


 


""But I allowed the headmaster to go through with his decision. Neither of us knew this was to happen, and we are very sorry. The headmaster thought it was for the best, and for reasons I do not know. But I know that the professor knew what he was doing and it was for a good reason.""


 


Dhatura thought on this, and knew it was her only option outside of remaining homeless. 


 


""I... Accept... It would be nice to have an actual place to stay, Professor McGonagall,"" the girl thought aloud. 


 


""Dear, please call me Minerva for now. Of course, at Hogwarts you are still to call me Professor, but for now we are living in the same household,"" the woman said, now giving a firm half smile. ""Do you have any... er, valuables left at your spot? We can pick them up on our way back.""


 


This all felt so unreal to her. If she played her cards right, she might never have to go back to that bridge again.


 


Knowing nothing had was valuable enough for her to go back, the girl shook her head. She already had her knife for protection, but nothing else was needed from her site.


 


Minerva nodded, not sure if she liked that answer, or utterly despised it. She called out ""Hellor!""


 


""Er, hello to you too... Minerva..."" She thought the woman was now insane. Quite a common thought today. Wizards were just odd compared to what she knew to be true.


 


The older woman raised an amused eyebrow at the girl. ""No dear, Hellor, is my house elf."" Just as she said the last syllable, a small figure popped directly in front of them. 


 


The small thing was like a bald child, with tennis ball eyes and huge bat ears, and it wore yellow flowery curtains like a toga. 


 


""Yes Mistress? What can Hellor do for you?"" The small thing squeaked.


 


""Yes, Hellor, this is Dhatura Potter, she will be staying with us for the time being, at least until September when she leaves for Hogwarts. Can you please make sure that the room directly across from mine is ready for our guest?""


 


Snapping to attention, Hellor once again squeaked, ""Yes Mistress! Anything else for the two Mistresses?""


 


An impish smile came across Minerva's face, and it suited her quite well in Dhatura's opinion. ""Yes, Hellor, please prepare a nice birthday cake for the young girl, as today is her birthday. Please pop over to Dumbledore's office and tell him he is invited over for dinner and cake if he so pleases, and to bring his great-niece as well."" The younger girl's face flushed at the attention.


 


""Absolutely Mistress! Thank yous!"" And the elf popped off.


 


Unable to make any noise except for a whine out of shock, Minerva got the girl's attention, by saying, ""Now, I believe we mentioned a pet before?""


 


***


 


Leaving the 

Magical Menagerie

, the sun was lower into the clouds, casting a burst of orange kissed light into the alley. 


 


Dhatura held onto a cage where her new kitten, a currently unnamed light ginger ragdoll cat of one month, was peacefully curled up. No one had picked the cat, as it was too tiny and was shunted from the litter, which reminded the girl of herself; tiny and abandoned, but slowly finding a new home. 


 


McGonagall joined her, picked up her trunk, filled to the top but not weighing anymore than two or three stones. 


 


""Grab my arm once more Dhatura,"" and she held out her hand. 


 


The moment she held on, she felt the squeezing sensation again, and as soon as they got onto ground again, Dhatura somehow tripped and tumbled into a heap. 


 


She took a long look around the room. It was a spacious cottage, and was well lit, decorated in soft greys and blues, with accents of red and gold things plaquing the wall.


 


Instead of commenting, the professor called out for Hellor again. 


 


""Yes Mistresses?""


 


""Hellor, take Dhatura and her luggage to her room, please. Dhatura, unpack, or sort, whatever you want to do with the room is up to you, it's yours. I will be running some errands, but I will be back quite soon. I'm simply getting basic clothes for you, just simple things, and anything that won't fit, I will resize,"" the woman ordered.


 


""Yes Mistress!"" The house elf squeaked, and popped away with the trunk, only to pop back and drag Dhatura, who was clutching her kitten's cage in shock. 


 


Holding on to her hand, the tiny creature brought her stumbling up the stairs, and careening to a room with a soft maroon door. The door opened and Dhatura was beyond happy and content. 


 


The room, painted with light yellows and blues, was the coziest place she could imagine. The bed sat in the middle of the room, a large full-sized bed. 


 


She ran up and jumped onto the beautiful, well-made bed.


 


""But Mistress Potter, I just made it...""


 


Dhatura didn't hear her. She began to cry. Never before did she have actual things of her own, to keep and enjoy. She felt overjoyed, if not a teensy bit suspicious at how everything came together.


 


She heard Hellor pop away, off to do her duties, and instead of unpacking, she decided to take a nap. Dhatura bent down, plucked her snoozing kitten up, and brought her onto the bed with her. 


 


The last thing that crossed her mind before dozing off was gratefulness at all of the things she had received today.


 


***


 


Dhatura woke up to a subdued knock at the door. 


 


""I'm up! What time is it?"" She felt a little bit crazed after waking up so suddenly from her little kip. 


 


She leapt up, disturbing her kitten, and slammed open the door, expecting to find Minerva or Hellor.


 


Instead what she found was another young girl, about 5 inches taller than her shrunken 4'1"". She had silvery blonde hair, an extraordinarily plain face with high brows. She had a kind smile, to match her opulent blue eyes. 


 


""Hello! The professors sent me to come get you! I'm Ariana Dumbledore!""


 


""Ah, uh, hi? I'm Dhatura Potter..."" This was not what Dhatura had expected.


 


""Well, obviously, silly! Come, dinner is about to be served! We're having bangers and mash! Hellor makes really good food, so dinner will be amazing!""


 


This girl was quite the ball of sunshine, and Dhatura thought it was fantastic if not a touch annoying. 


 


Ariana grabbed her arm and dragged her down the stairs the same way Hellor had.


 


They ran into the dinning room, to find an elaborate table set up with Minerva and an old man with youthful twinkling eyes. He had a beard longer than his waistband and half-moon glasses. 


 


""Hello, Ms. Potter, I am Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster to Hogwarts,"" the man started. ""It's nice to finally see you again."" 


 


""Uh, hello, sir,"" Dhatura stumbled. She realized she probably looked very rumpled from her nap, and her hair, a permanent rats nest, was even more mussed than usual. 


 


""I see you have met my great-niece, Ariana. She will be attending Hogwarts with you, entering at first-year as well."" He was quite a kind man.


 


""Yes! I am very excited to start at Hogwarts! I'm also super excited to have a friend to sit with on the train! We can go early, if grandfather will allow me to come here before going to the train, and we can find a compartment together!"" 


 


Dhatura smiled cheerfully, but hesitantly. This was her first friend. And while she was way better than that bratty kid from the robes shop, she doubted the girl would want to actually be friends with her.


 


""That sounds cool!""


 


They all chatted for a bit longer, until dinner was officially served and they ate healthily. 


 


After eating the sausage and mashed potatoes, Hellor magicked the plates away with one snap of her fingers. 


 


A well-sized cake then floated out onto the table, candles lit bright as the stars above. Dhatura could hear the crackling of the fireplace from the sitting room. 


 


As they ate the cake together, the chatter pleasantly died away to eat the delicious chocolate sweet pastry. 


 


The silence was interrupted by the headmaster's revelation. ""Hellor! I do believe we should retire to the living room, with some hot chocolate, perhaps? We brought some gifts for the birthday girl.""


 


Dhatura blushed embarrassed, as she felt like she had already gotten enough from people today. 


 


They resided to the seats in front of the fireplace, as it roared and sparked comfortingly. The fire played a dance for the group, as they talked about what Hogwarts was like, and Dhatura asked questions about the wizarding world.


 


Finally, Ariana burst. ""Uncle! Can we please give Dhatura her present now! I'm so excited to give it to her!""


 


The headmaster chuckled at his great-niece's energy for giving. ""Yes, my dear. Go grab them, please, I left them next to the front door.""


 


Ariana jumped up and ran towards the entrance, and rushed back. 


 


She handed them to Dhatura and returned to her seat, bouncing. 


 


The first package was small and wrapped quite badly. The other was the size of her head, but quite heavy in weight. 


 


She opened the smaller one, and in it was a gracefully braided bracelet with a little charm of a moon. The braid consisted of greens, blues and purples. She loved it, her first ever present given to her. 


 


""You see, I have the same one, but with a sun charm!"" She stuck her wrist out to show it to Dhatura. ""I made them myself but my Grandad was the one who bought the charms for me!"" Ariana rambled.


 


Dhatura gave a quick smile to the girl. ""It's very nice! Thank you!""


 


""Yes! Now open the next one!""


 


Ripping the paper open, Dhatura found a box that held a soft yellow baby blanket, several pictures, and a large stack of journals entitled 

'The Journal of Lily Jasmine Evans.' 



 


The baby blanket had 3 moving animals on them, a stag, a big black dog, and a wolf. It brought back memories of a little stuffed dog called ""Padfoot"" she'd had a child that Dudley shoved into his parents' document shredder, completely tearing it apart when they were 6 years old. Stitched into the blanket, in elegant cursive it read 

'To my bright Sunflower.'



 


The photos looked slightly seared at the edges like they had been in a fire a long time ago. They had pictures of a young family; a deeply tanned man with large glasses and messy dark hair and a pale redhead with twinkling green eyes moved around the paper, beaming up at her, like they knew exactly who she was. Some featured a sandy haired man with deep scars, or a handsome man with long dark locks. Every once in a while, a chubby but scared looking blonde man peeked into the frames.


 


Tears came to her eyes. Before today she knew nothing about her past, or her parents who now learned had died for her. 


 


Lastly, Dhatura took hold of the dozen or so journals of her mother's, knowing she was going to cherish them. 


 


She looked up to Professor Dumbledore, who was somber, the happy twinkle in his eyes now moved to a regretful glisten. 


 


""When Minerva owled me this morning about what had happened, I had no idea... I left you in that household for protection, but it seems I failed you, my dear. I never wanted this to happen. I should have taken Minerva's advice, but I was too busy thinking about the greater good."" Looking at Dumbledore, anyone could see his remorse clear as a midsummer's day. ""I'm sorry."" 


 


Dhatura didn't know what to say. She supposed she was too young, too unknowing of the world to fully put together what was said to her. There was still so much she didn't know.


 


""Sir, I- I accept your apology. Someday, I would like answers, but right now I just want to be content, if that's alright."" She tried to make herself sit up straight in her seat, and be more mature than her pixie-like stature allowed her to be. 


 


""Quite right, Ms. Potter. Everything in that box I scrounged up after visiting the site of your parent's cottage several years ago. Most everything had been left to ruins, unfortunately, but I was lucky to find what I did.""


 


Dhatura was awe-struck at the lengths people were willing to go to, for 

her

. ""This is the most amazing gift I have ever gotten, sir. You too, Ariana! Thank you! This has been an amazing day!"" She beamed up at every person in the room, feeling warm and welcome for the first time that she could ever remember.


 


***


 


After promising Ariana she would 'owl her', the two Dumbledores left as gracefully as they came, and Dhatura got a shower due to much prompting from Minerva.


 


Finally done for the night, Dhatura looked over her gifts one last time, her unnamed kitten curled up her again. Taking her old baby blanket from the box, she ran her hand over the stitching of the word 

'Sunflower'. 

She looked to her tiny ragdoll, who gazed at her expectantly. ""Do you like the name Sunflower?""


 


The kitten, now called Sunflower, purred lovingly. 


 


She set the blanket on her pillow and moved on to look at the pictures.


 


She gazed at her parents. Her mum looked to be very pregnant, probably with her. They were so young, probably not even 22 years of age. Her dad, just as tan as she herself was, was beaming at Lily, touching her stomach with such joy in his eyes that it brought Dhatura to tears. 


 


She realized, she missed her parents. There were holes in her heart where they belonged. 


 


She grew up on her own, in the dirty underground of London, and she wanted her parents so desperately now it pained her. 


 


Longing for the connection that she lacked for such an extended time, Dhatura looked to her mother's diaries for guidance. 


 


And she started to read.



***


 



""30 January 1971,



 



I've finally gotten my Hogwarts letter after 2 years of waiting! I've been waiting for today, because Sev told me that you get your letter on your 11th birthday, or even a bit before in some cases. 



 



It's really nice to have a friend who already knew all about this magical side of the world. I'm not going in blind, and I'm learning everyday. Sev once brought a book of household spells with him that he took from his mother, Mrs. Prince. It's all so interesting!



 



Tuney, though, still keeps warning me away from him. I feel bad, like I'm betraying her, but honestly, I'm just so curious about this world I'm about to enter!



 



Mum and dad were shocked, but they're so proud of me. I'm thankful they were never the religious sort, because they might have condemned me or something.



 



Mum told me that we would go to Diagon Alley together in June, and I'm so excited I'm counting the days...""



 


***


 


Dhatura fell asleep reading the journal, while Sunflower purred, curled up on a pillow. She felt like, while they were gone from her life, she had a piece; a tiny piece enough to give her the parental guidance she had prayed to the gods for years for. 


 


The next thing she knew was the sound of the ocean from outside her window of the cottage, the feeling of sunlight on her cheeks, and the vibrations of a quiet knocking at her door. 


 


""Dhatura? It's early but I have breakfast and we have plenty of things to do today,"" Minerva called. ""All of your clothes are in the dresser, I had Hellor put them there.""


 


She shouted an affirmation, heard Minerva walk back downstairs, and hopped up.


 


She went to the dresser in the corner of her room and saw so many clothes she had to step back in a startled manner.


 


Shakily, she picked out a striped navy and red shirt, pairing it with a random pair of light jean shorts. She didn't expect all of this, maybe a jumper and a single outfit, but definitely not a whole wardrobe.


 


The clothes shrimped her a bit, but that was fine. 


 


Walking over to the mirror, Dhatura ran a hand through her hair; long, dead, ratty but so much like her father's. Her skin, tan as her father's, but freckles dotted her face the same way they did her mother. She looked exactly like her mother, small and fairy-like, but Dhatura looked more shrimpy and skinny. 


 


And her eyes, green as the healthy leaves waving through the summer sky, the same shade of her mum's.


 


Knocking herself out of her stupor, Dhatura left her room. She raced downstairs, ready to eat and find out what her day was to be.


 


The two women ate a hearty breakfast of porridge and toast, as Minerva explained the plans.


 


""We are going to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, as I scheduled an appointment with a pediatrician to look over your health. We want you healthy and ready for Hogwarts."" Dhatura nodded. ""Then we shall eat lunch at home, and after, you can wander around here, sort anything if need be, while I make a stop to the Ministry and Gringotts to register myself as your guardian."" 


 


""Ok,"" she said simply, as there was not anything she felt objectionable. 


 


""Then, if we have time before supper, we should cut your hair, as it is most likely insufferable as it is, correct?"" Minerva inquired.


 


""W-well it's not too bad if I leave it up, but yes that would be nice,"" Dhatura claimed. 


 


Their dished popped away at the hands of Hellor. 


 


""Might as well get on with the day,"" the older woman exclaimed. 


 


They finish getting ready for the day and meet back at the front door of the cottage. 


 


""I don't have Floo powder or a Floo connection, which is another way of travelling, so we are apparating again, to the London entrance of the hospital. Grab hold again,"" Dhatura once again cringed and touched Minerva's arm. She didn't even want to question what Floo was.


 


Once again, the feeling came and went in an instant, and she opened her eyes to see an alleyway of central London. Minerva led her across the street to what seemed like an abandoned department store, made of crumbling red brick. 


 


Stopping right in front of the window, the woman grabbed hold of her hand after looking around to see if anyone was watching them, and stepped them into the window and through the looking glass.


 


""I hate magical entrances,"" Dhatura said to herself, and not for the last time. 


Thank you for all the kudos, hits, comments and bookmarks! They are all appreciated! I'm going to get around to answering comments soon, but writing is hard, and I'm babysitting a lot whilst still trying to find a stupid job for the summer. 

Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Chapter 4


 


Dhatura stumbled once again., and was beginning to think it was just in her nature. 


 


Blinking her eyes open, she found herself on the floor of quite a normal hospital from what she understood they looked like in the Muggle world. Minerva walked up to the lady at a desk and spoke squarely. ""Here to see Healer Lockley for an appointment for Ms. Potter.""


 


The witch at the desk sighed loudly, like she was annoyed to be doing her job. ""Pediatrics is on floor 7, right above the 'Muggle Illness Ward'. Check in there. Good day."" The woman was quite rude and spoke in a flat voice, simply turning the page on her magazine that read ""Witch Weekly"". 


 


Minerva simply raised an eyebrow and moved on, ushering her young ward. 


 


They made it to the 7th floor, to find a male orderly sitting at the front desk. ""Appointment for Ms. Potter with Healer Lockey?"" Minerva said stiffly.


 


This man was much brighter. ""Ah yes! Ms. Potter! Nice to see you! Yes, come right back! I'm Nurse Patterson, how are you feeling today Ms. Potter?""


 


She beamed right back at him. ""I'm feeling better than I have in ages, thank you!""


 


""Amazing! Let me get you to your room then take your vitals alright? Then the doctor will be right in."" She nodded along with the man.


 


She was led to a light blue room, and the walls had moving painted fish. There was seaweed and sand and crabs and so much more. You could tell it was a room for the children's section.


 


Minerva sat on a visitor chair in the corner, while Nurse Patterson nudged her onto the bed.


 


""Now lie down, I'm going to perform some diagnostic spells and they work best when you're flat.""


 


She does as the man says and watches as he waves his wand silently over her, literally working his magic. 


 


""I was told this was your first doctor's appointment ever so I'm going to do another diagnostic test for your eyesight. Please sit up.""


 


She did as she was told and he carried on talking. ""I'm in training to be a magical optometrist, but I'm doing my rounds on the kids' floor, so it's no trouble. Now, do you have any problems seeing? Is it blurry when you read things close, or far?""


 


She thought for a moment. ""Er, yes. I have to squint to read most of the time."" He nodded, and read the diagnostic.


 


He raised an eyebrow. ""That must be an understatement, because this is telling me you're nearly blind... Tell you what, I'll go get your glasses sorted out and Healer Lockley can take care of everything else. I'll leave the diagnostic reports with her.""


 


He left and the room went silent, as Dhatura looked around wondering what the results were going to be. 


 


A knock came at the door. A short, curvy woman with dark skin entered. ""Hello there Ms. Potter! I'm Healer Patricia Lockley. I got your results here. First I must ask, Ms.-sorry, Professor McGonagall to leave the room. This information is private and for medical purposes. You are welcome to tea and biscuits in the sitting room. You will get a record of the results but the talk is private""


 


The woman stiffly nodded and left swiftly but gave Dhatura a comforting nod as she exited. 


 


""Alright, let's get started, dear!"" The woman cheered. ""Alright, so your tests show signs of severe malnutrition. I know it's probably a tough subject, but you only have to give the basics.""


 


The woman was quite comforting. ""Er- I lived with my aunt and uncle, Muggles who hated me. They didn't feed me much, nothing if I was being punished... And then they, uh, left and I lived in London under a bridge"" The woman gazed down and wrote in her notes. 


 


""Ok, we can fix that but it 

will

 take time. And there is also a bone fracture in your left arm that never healed properly. Does it give you any pain? And can you tell me how it was caused?""


 


""My arm hurts every once in a while but nothing too bad. Uh- my uncle threw me down the stairs when I was 7, because he was mad that I grew my hair back overnight..."" Dhatura mumbled this. It was all quite intrusive. 


 


""Also, before I move on, I'm required to ask this. Since you were living in several bad situations... In either situation were you ever forced to do... things with your body that didn't want to do?"" Dhatura looked highly embarrassed.


 


""No, I, uh, knew people in the circle I was in who were, but I was fortunate enough to, uh, not,"" she stuttered. The healer simply nodded and moved on.


 


""The scans also showed evidence of a lot of scar tissue, particularly on your back. If you don't mind, can you show me? You don't have to, obviously, but it would be helpful,"" the healer spoke softly as if not to scare the girl.


 


""I think that would be-be o-ok. May I please keep my training bra on?""


 


""Absolutely, dear. I will turn around and jot some notes until you tell me you're ready.""


 


Dhatura took off her red and blue shirt. She turned around so her back was facing the healer, and gave the ok to turn around.


 


She heard the healer give a light gasp. There were scars all up and down her back. Most of them were horizontal, but a few were vertical, running parallel to her spine. It looked like a cruel man's tic-tac-toe board. 


 


""Oh dear. I don't believe these will ever go away completely, but there is scar cream that will help them fade.""


 


Dhatura tilted her head down, as if ashamed. The doctor allowed her to put her shirt back on.


 


Healer Lockley must have read her mind because when she was finished, and they faced each other once again, she locked eyes with the girl. ""Scars don't make you less anything. They make you more brave, capable, and worthy of love. Don't ever feel ashamed of the battles you have fought, because even if you have lost them and been scarred, it still means you have survived and conquered.""


 


The woman looked like she knew this from experience and wasn't just talking out of her ass. Dhatura's eyes hit her lap as she pondered these words.


 


The healer nodded to her and left, prompting Minerva and the nurse from before to come back in. 


 


The bright blonde man perked up and smiled at her. ""Alright! We have your glasses! We also have to talk about the regimens you are now to be on! And here, Profesor, is your copy of the results.""


 


Minerva nodded, intent on catching every word. Her hand clenched the folder given to her.


 


""Alright, so since you are heavily malnourished, we are going to prescribe you a daily Bone-Strengthening Potion 

and

 a daily Nourishment Potion so you can catch up with other girls your age. Unfortunately, it's so deep-rooted at this point that it will help you catch up, but you will still always be a little bit below the curve. Chances are you won't grow beyond 5'1 or 5'2."" The man grinned at that. ""Reminds me of my older sister; destined to be short.""


 


He moved on, after seeing the room lighten a bit of the tension that had previously gripped the room. 


 


""Alright, and the bone potion should also help fully heal the left arm's unhealed fracture. We are also providing scar cream for the scar tissue on the back. Unfortunately it won't really work on the scar, seeing as it's a cursed scar and there's not much anyone can do.""


 


The man turned around to grab a small object he had left on the counter. ""Lastly! Here are your glasses! There weren't many frames to pick from, and I sensed you were neither a girly-girl nor a tomboy, so I picked some frames somewhat in the middle.""


 


The glasses were perfectly round, and gleaming new. The frames were black as the night. She put them on and they rested perfectly on her pert nose. 


 


Nurse Patterson conjured a hand mirror and held it up for her. She eyed herself and they were perfect! The glasses suited her face rather well.


 


""Yes I thought that you would like them. They don't block your emerald eyes either!"" The man was over the moon that she liked his pick.


 


She shined a smile at him and he returned it full force. ""Alright! I'm going to go grab your prescriptions and then you may leave!""


 


He ran off, and Minerva tucked the folder somewhere into the folds of long mauve robes.


 


Patterson came back, with a large paper bag of supplies, and saw them off, wishing them a good rest of the day.


 


***


 


It was noon when they apparated home for lunch, to see Hellor floating the food and lunch set to the table. 


 


She squeaked happily. ""Ah, Mistresses! You're home just in time! Lunch is served. You is having grilled cheeses and tomato soups! Pumpkin juice is on the table!"" And the tiny thing popped away.


 


The two women sat at the table and ate graciously, happy for the entire healing ordeal over with. 


 


They finished quickly, both famished before, but now their full bellies were content. 


 


Minerva announced to her that she would be leaving for her aforementioned errands to Gringotts and Ministry, and she was allowed free reign on the premises. If she were to have any questions, she was to summon Hellor.


 


So the professor popped off, and Dhatura called out to Hellor that was going to explore the land around the cottage. 


 


She set off, new blue rain boots stuffed onto her feet. She marched down the sloped hillside besides the cottage and landed in the sand. In front of her was a lovely beach, with a wild sea in front of it. 


 


It stretched off the coast of the small island and Dhatura was curious. She called out, ""Hellor, I have a question!"" The compact elf popped into existence on the beach. 


 


""How can I help you Mistress Potters?"" She squeaked.


 


""Where exactly... are we? Where is the cottage located?""


 


The elf perked up, ""We is in Scotland! The cottage is being on a remote island up north!""


 


The girl nodded and dismissed the elf kindly.


 


Sitting onto the gritty sand, Dhatura got herself comfortable. She let her hair down ungracefully tangling with the knotted mess as it fell upon her back.


 


She allowed herself to contemplate everything, but also let her mind wander. She knew part of who she was now, something she had been questioning for years. She had a past, she'd had parents, a home, and so much more. 


 


Dhatura's thoughts meandered to Hogwarts, which was only a month away. Anticipation gripped her tight as her heart sped behind her ribcage. 


 


She was going to learn 

magic!

 It felt better than a miracle, because for so long she had nothing, but now she was going to go to school to learn magic and she already had a friend! She had more than one dirty outfit, and school supplies, and a bracelet, and so much more than she could have ever imagined for herself. 


 


Now all she had to do was play the waiting game.


 


***


 


It was late afternoon by the time Minerva got back and she looked quite exhausted. She waved off any of Dhatura's attempts to get her to rest, as the woman was determined to sort out her hair.


 


The professor magicked up a comfortable wooden chair for the girl to sit while she tugged and ripped at her hair in the clean bathroom. 


 


Minerva got right down to work. 


 


Dhatura winced every second, imagining that the comb must already look like a small dog. 


 


The older woman soothed her, ""Halfway there. Now we just have to cut."" And suddenly a pair of scissors reached her right hand from where they sat on the bathroom counter in front of the mirror. 


 


Next, she heard the snipping of the scissors through her hair, feeling the blades touch her mid-back as they glided. She was given the ok to stand up and immediately rifled a hand through her hair, effectively mussing it up. Behind her Minerva smiled, lost in a memory of James Potter and his tendency to do the exact same thing. 


 


""M-Minerva...? Coul-Could I have bangs?"" Dhatura asked timidly, then quickly followed up. ""N-Not that I don't like my scar being shown, it is wicked but I think it might just be easier to not have people constantly staring at it. I had bangs before, but they grew out.""


 


""I'll see what I can do,"" the Hogwarts professor replied, and bent in front of the girl who was once again seated on the chair. 


 


She lengthed out the hair, and held it ready to chop. ""Ready, Dhatura?"" And she nodded.


 


This time, she saw the scissors gliding in front of her. Some tiny stray hairs tickled her nose as they floated past her face. 


 


Once again, Minerva patted her shoulder, telling her it was ok to look. 


 


She liked her new hairstyle a lot so far, constantly combing the wildness with her fingers throughout dinner, and even afterwards as she read through her mother's journal, puzzling over this mysterious 'Sev'.


 


***


 


The next several weeks went in accordance; in the mornings, she would eat breakfast and take her nutrition potions, which she learned more potions taste incredibly terrible, like rotten apples and milk. 


 


Then until lunch she would read and study from her textbooks, as well as the other books Minerva had her buy. The more she learned the more fascinated she was. 


 


They would eat lunch together, peacefully, while Dhatura talked to her guardian about what she was learning. 


 


After lunch, Dhatura would explore the cottage and the small Scottish island it rested upon. 


 


Then, just before dinner, almost like clockwork, an owl would arrive from Ariana, just as she had promised her. She would read the letter over, and respond in kind, sometimes asking questions about things she didn't quite understand from the other girl's letters.


 


Supper was also a quiet affair for the two. They ate, then went their separate ways for the night, except on Friday nights, where they would bandy around in front of the fireplace, drinking hot chocolate and told whatever stories they had, though Minerva had quite a few more.


 


On other nights after supper, Dhatura would shower, ready for bed, and read her mother's journals while cuddled up to Sunflower, dozing off into the night.


 


Life was quite serene, and it was the most comfortable she had ever been. 


 


But she continued to wait for the other shoe to drop, just in case.


 


***


 


Hellor woke her up early, as she had asked. Dhatura jumped up, shoved her glasses on and began grooming herself for the day.


 


She saw herself practically vibrating in front of the mirror, thrilled for her next adventure.


 


She combed through her hair, giving a valid attempt at taming it to no avail, then rushed around to get ready and do last minute packing.


 


It was September 1st, and she was starting Hogwarts.


 


She was already packed and sorted. And re-packed and re-sorted. Thrice.


 


She practically flew down the stairs, where Hellor had set up a large breakfast for the two residence, three, including the young Dumbledore who was set to arrive at any moment by what she was told was called a 'portkey'. She would find out soon enough what one was like, as that's how Minerva was sending them to the train station '9 and  3/4 '.


 


How were they to go to a station 

between

 9 and 10? She imagined there was a magical entrance, but Minerva told them that the portkey was to take them directly onto the train platform. 


 


At the last minute, Dhatura begged Hellor to give her a fancy braid, to which a small creature relented, holding quite a soft spot for the girl. 


 


As the elf finished her braid, and coerced the girl to her daily potions before her guest came, the household all heard a loud 

'oof' 

alerting them to Ariana's arrival.


 


Dhatura, a bundle of nerves, all but threw herself at her proclaimed best friend of a month. 


 


""Dhatura! 

Today!

 We're going 

today!

 I cannot believe it!"" The girl squealed, just as excited as her best friend. 


 


The two skipped back to the cottage, and sat for breakfast, waiting for a harried McGonagall to join them until they heard, ""You girls can eat without me! I'm running behind, I'll be down to send you off with a portkey when you're done!""


 


The two girls giggled at the idea of their new professor procrastinating like a student. 


 


They ate and chatted together, as they hadn't seen each other in person for almost a month, but owled each other every single day.


 


They had run Minerva's owl, Esme, ragged until Ariana got her own which she named Lady Marshmallow. The thing was literally a holy terror despite having such a cutesy name. It liked to dive bomb Dhatura, and had the habit of biting whoever didn't give her a treat.


 


And so Dhatura continued her streak of not getting along with owls.


 


The best friends finished up, and travelled up to Dhatura's room to chase her kitten into her travel cage. Dragging her stuff down, she called for her guardian. They were ready to leave, overly eager to get there.


 


It was 10.15 by the time Minerva came down, looking haggard. She brought with her handkerchief. She speaks a spell into it, hugs Dhatura quickly, then wishes the two good luck.


 


The next thing the two knew, it felt like two hooks had grabbed into their navels, whooshing them around wildly.


 


They tumbled to the ground in an uncomfortable heap of limbs. Magical families, used to this sort of phenomenon, stepped around them and kept moving toward the gleaming brilliant red train in front of them. 


 


The Hogwarts Express was eye-catching in a way that Dhatura didn't know any old train could be. 


 


The dusted themselves off and maneuvered their way to the train passed a large family of kind-looking red-heads. 


 


Dhatura being the bean-pole she was, could barely carry her trunk, much less lift it onto the train. Ariana, knowing this was a point of pride, tried not to laugh or patronize the girl. 


 


But that didn't stop the two twin read-heads from trying.


 


""Want a hand?"" The twin on the left asked.


 


Dhatura, prideful as ever glared at the two, but knew was going to lose the battle valiantly. ""I s'pose I will let you, seeing as you two seem to only be courteous and know that I could do it myself... Right?""


 


The two twins shared a look, exchanging humorous looks. They instantaneously began to put on a  performance.


 


""Why yes m'lady!"" ""We would never think anything else of such a brave-"" ""-capable-"" ""-knight of the highest order!""


 


She slumped, and Ariana hid a laugh.


 


Grumbling, knowing she had been beaten, she mumbled, ""Just get on with it, yeah?""


 


They grinned. ""Fred and George Weasley at your service! Let us go!"" And they grabbed both of the girls' things and ushered them in, finding the first empty compartment. 


 


She quickly brushed her bangs away for a second, already exhausted from the fall and the rush. She didn't witness it but one twin nudged the other and nodded his head at the revealed scar, but they said nothing. Araian, however, noticed the exchange and was thankful for their silence; her friend already had enough to deal with, and didn't want to see the girl pressured even more by the fame shoved onto her.


 


The identical red-heads both caressed a different hand, bowed, and left with a ""Fare-well our precious Warrior Queen!""


 


Ariana snorted quietly. ""If Hogwarts is anywhere near as entertaining as those two, our school career will be quite the comedy show.""


 


And the two waited for their journey to begin. 


Thank you everyone once again! I continue smiling everyday seeing how much people are enjoying this so far! I'm enjoying this just as much!

And just an fyi all my chapters are un-beta'd so if anyone wants, or knows how to get a beta pls lmk. I'm not too desperate but I think it's good to have one, right?

Updating twice in one night bc insomnia hit and I had nothing better to do.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Chapter 5


 


They heard the red-head family wishing each other goodbye. 


 


""Mum! We reckon we just saw Dhatura Potter!""


 


Hearing this from the train, Dhatura herself blushed and shrunk in her seat. 


 


""Oh hush, the poor girl isn't an animal in the zoo to be staring at!"" The young girl was thankful for that comment. ""Ron! Dear, you've got dirt on your nose!"" And she took out a napkin, swiping at his face. 


 


He wriggled away, disgruntled at being babied. ""Mum! Geroff!""


 


""Awwwww, does ickle Ronnikins got somfink on his nosie-wosie?"" They heard the twins coo in unison, in the same fashion they seemed to do everything.


 


The youngest boy muttered an irritable, ""Shut up gits,"" at his older brothers.


 


Their mother, sweet as she was, moved on. ""Where's Percy?"" She asked, just as another boy walked up. He was already in his black and red robes, and on them shined a gold badge with a big 

P

 on it. 


 


""Can't stay long, Mother,"" the boy, Percy, spoke bigly. ""I'm up front, the prefects have got two comparments up front-""


 


The twins entered the conversation. ""Oh, are you a 

Prefect

, Percy?"" ""You should have said-"" ""-something, we had no-"" ""-bloody idea!""


 


They faked a puzzled expression. ""Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it..."" ""Once-"" ""Or twice-"" ""A minute"" ""All summer-""


 


Tired of being the butt of the joke, the oldest boy huffed, ""Oh shut up..."" 


 


The mother rolls her eyes at their antics and turns to the twins, ""Now, do try not to get in too much trouble this year? If I get one owl telling me something like you've blown up a toilet, or- or-""


 


""We've never blown up a toilet-"" ""But thanks for the idea, Mum!""


 


""It's not funny! And do try to look after Ron...""


 


The little girl on the mother's side tugged on her sleeve. ""Mummy! Fred and George said Dhatura Potter is on the train! Can I please go see her! She must be so cool..."" 


 


Once again playing the ever stern mother, she said, ""What have I told you lot, she is just an ordinary girl! Become friends with her if you will, but don't treat her any different, you hear? She's already had enough pain for one lifetime.""


 


The family all looked at one another, then hugged and gave their final goodbyes to their sister and mother.


 


Dhatura felt even more embarrassed now but thankful for their mother's words.

 'I am just a normal kid.'



 


***


 


The train whistle blows and they hear the little sister begin to cry. 


 


One of the twins reached out and yelled, ""Don't cry, Ginny! We'll send loads of owls home!"" ""We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat!""


 


Their mother was scandalized. 

""George!"" 



 


They laughed. ""Just joking, Mum! Keep your hair on!""


 


The train moves faster and faster until the women of their family are left on the platform and their speeding towards their first year at Hogwarts. 


 


A knock came at the door, and the door slid open revealing the youngest male red-head of the family. He pointed at the empty seats, ""Are any of these seats taken? Everywhere else is full..."" The boy blushed as if sheepish that he had nowhere else. 


 


The girls who sat across from one another exchanged a look and nodded for him to sit. 


 


The boy still seemed to have the dirt on his nose, too. 


 


The compartment door slid open again. ""Hey Ron.""


 


The twins were back. 


 


""Listen, we're going down the middle of the train - Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula that he's sneaking in as a pet.""


 


Ron muttered, ""Right.""


 


""Dhatura, unknown girl-"" they barely heard the 

'it's Ariana'

 coming from the girl herself. ""Right, Ariana, we have introduced ourselves, m'ladies, but we have yet to introduce our brother, Ronald Weasley.""


 


The boy flushed once again, but the twins carried on. ""Alright well, we'll be going!"" ""Smell ya later!"" And before the door shut they could hear the other twin say, exasperated, ""Mate, I've told ya, it just doesn't work...""


 


Their voices faded down the hallway of the train.


 


Dhatura knew he was going to ask the question before he did. In fact the boy looked about ready to burst when- ""Are you really Dhatura Potter?""


 


Ariana looked a bit annoyed at the boy for his insensitivity, but Dhatura didn't mind. She was told by her new guardian that was to be expected, as she

 had

 defeated the most evil wizard of all as a baby. 


 


She simply nodded. 


 


""O-oh s-sorry I just thought it might've been one of the twins' jokes again..."" He paused. ""And have you really got the- you know...""


 


Dhatura wordlessly pushed aside her fringe, showing the boy her lightning bolt scar. ""Can't remember a thing, though, can I? Was a baby."" 


 


He looked away, still quite awkward, and felt bad about pushing too hard. 


 


So Ariana struck up conversation, always willing to make friends, even if they were a bit insensitive. 


 


""So are all your family wizards?"" Ariana inquired. 


 


Ron perked up a bit, seeing the hand he'd been given. ""Er- pretty sure yeah. My Mum said she has a 2nd cousin who's an accountant but never talks much about him.""


 


Dhatura, always yearning to know more about the culture of their world, said, ""Then you must know loads about the wizarding world!"" 


 


Ron nodded. ""Yeah, I guess. I heard you lived with muggles. What were they like?""


 


This was an innocent question, as only a single person outside of doctors and the Hogwarts staff knew about the whole 'homeless' thing, and that was Ariana. Who was coincidentally looking alarmed at Dhatura, making sure she would break or cry or anything of the sort. 


 


""Er- yeah. Muggles. Lived with 'em..."" She was obviously lying out of her teeth. ""Er- they're not all bad. Sorta like wizards; some are good, some are bad.""


 


Ariana switched the topic, very quickly, not wanting her friend to think too hard about the past. ""Yes, well I wished that I grew up with three brothers. I'm an only child too.""


 


""Five,"" the boy looked quite sad. ""I'm the sixth kid to go to school. Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, me and lastly, Ginny. I just... feel a lot of pressure to go above and beyond. Bill was Headboy, Charlie was Quidditch Captain, Percy is a Prefect, and Fred and George are just popular because they're funny.""


 


The girls shared a look. Ariana, ever the mediator, took hold of the situation. ""Listen, it may seem like you have a lot to live up to, but you can't let it be an anchor. You are you. Not your other brothers. Even if you follow in their footsteps, just learn who you are and what you're good at, because you aren't them.""


 



'Bloody deep, that was'

, Dhatura thought to herself.


 


Ron looked a little bit happier. ""Yeah, I s'pose you're right Ariana... Plus, I can beat them all at chess, even Bill! And I'm better at taking care of animals than they are. I got Percy's old rat, and he looks loads better now than when Percy had 'im.""


 


He takes out an old, sleeping fat rat. Dhatura got a weird feeling from it, not quite knowing why. 


 


""His name's Scabbers. He's not impressive or anything but he's been in the family for so long, and it could be worse. I could have a toad or something stupid like that.""


 


They all talked for a bit longer, about their home lives, Dhatura kept up the lie about living with the muggles. 


 


""Yeah, before Min- er- Professor McGonagall told me, I didn't know wizards existed or anything about Voldemort-"" Ron gasps, while the two girls looked confused.


 


""You- 

you just said You-Know-Who's name!

""


 


Dhatura raised an eyebrow. ""See, I didn't know not to say it, but it's only a name. That's what Professor McGonagall told me.""


 


Ariana nodded along, taught the same thing by her great-uncle and grandfather. 


 


By then, the train had passed through London.


 


Around half-past noon, a smiling, dimpled old woman passed with a cart. ""Anything off the cart dears?""


 


Dhatura and Ariana move to get some things, suddenly feeling their hunger. Dhatura had never seen any of this kind of candy, 'raised' in a muggle world with sweets like Mars Bars. They didn't have Mars Bars. 


 


Instead there was a colorful array of strange sweets, like Bertie's Botts Every Flavour Bean, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Liquorice Wands, and so much more than she could even name. 


 


Not knowing what she would like, she got a few of everything, as it wasn't like she didn't have money for goddess sake. She paid the witch 11 sickles and 7 bronze knuts, and hauled it all inside. 


 


Ariana came back with just a Cauldron Cake, looking quite amused at Dhatura. 


 


""Hungry are you?"" The girl inquired of her best friend. 


 


""Eh, not quite yet, but I want to try it all because I've never had any of it all. Thought we could all share.""


 


Ron's head came up quickly, done staring at the ugly lumpy package of a sandwich in his lap. ""T-thank you!"" And with the sandwich forgotten, the friendship between the three in the room officially began.


 


***


 


""What are these?"" Dhatura asked aloud, holding up a Chocolate Frog. ""It's not really a frog is it?""


 


Ariana replied first, ""No, silly.""


 


Ron carried on, ""It's charmed to move like one. But check out the card! I'm missing Agrippa.""


 


She moved to check the card at the bottom of the box, catching and munching on the animated chocolate. 


 


Ariana, now sitting next to her, looks over her shoulder. ""Oh, it's Uncle Albus!"" The Dumbledore in the card winks up at her. 


 


The boy looked a bit stricken. ""Dumbledore is your

 uncle

?""


 


The blonde grinned. ""Great-Uncle technically. He's more of a second grandfather if anything.""


 


Dhatura read the card:


 



ALBUS DUMBLEDORE





CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS





Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten-pin bowling.



 


She turned the card back around to find Dumbledore gone. ""I always forget that they never stick around in photos sometimes.""


 


Ron snorted. ""Do you expect them too? They'll be back.


 


Dhatura shrugged. ""In the muggle world, photos don't move of their own free will.""


 


""

Weird...

""


 


They move on and Dhatura quickly learned what the 'Every Flavour' meant in Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. She still was scrapping the taste of a grass flavoured bean off her tongue.


 


The countryside was flowing past them in pastures of green as they laughed together. 


 


There was a knock at the compartment door, and a tearful boy stepped in. ""Have any of you seen a toad? I keep losing him, and when I ask older students they hex me!""


 


Dhatura stood up. ""Would you like help searching?"" The boy could only nodded miserably. 


 


She nodded to her friends, ""I'll be back."" 


 


She followed the boy around the train, comforting him along the way, and asking people if they'd seen a toad. Heads swivelled toward her suspicious of who she was, but most moved on instead of pursuing it. 


 


They ended up in Neville's compartment, which he said he shared with a girl named 'Hermione', who was helping in the search. 


 


To help distract him, she introduced herself. ""I'm Dhatura Potter, by the way."" The boy didn't even blink.


 


""Yeah, I know. Our parents were friends before..."" And he trailed off. He continued on a different path. ""My mum w-was your Godmother, or that's what Gran told me.""


 


She gaped at him, silent not knowing what to say. ""Wh-what's your name then?""


 


""Neville Longbottom."" He looked plenty distracted now. 


 


She grinned, because she knew just that little bit more about her family. ""Well, it's very nice to meet you Neville! Maybe, if we get to know each other a little better, we can be brother and sister? Or god-brother and god-sister?""


 


Neville looked hopeful at that. ""T-that would be lovely. Gran would be happy that I'm making friends already... She thought I was going to be a squib..."" She nodded, despite not knowing what that meant, and filed it away to ask Ariana later. 


 


The two sat and talked, both obviously avoiding childhood and parentage, until a bushy haired girl with big teeth and pretty dark skin entered. 


 


Dhatura said stood, said goodbye to Neville after promising to catch up later, and introduced herself to the girl. 


 


""Hello, I'm Dhatura Potter.""


 


The girl grinned. ""Are you really? I'm Hermione Granger. I've read about you! Pleased to make your acquaintance!""


 


This girl seemed like a lot but that wasn't a bad thing to be, in Dhatura's eyes.


 


""Seems everyone has, yeah. I'll see you guys later, alright?"" 


 


She skipped back to her compartment with glee at finding more lost remnants of her life, only to find something she didn't quite like at the entrance to her compartment. 


 


""... looking for Dhatura Potter. I was told she was sitting in here.""


 


It was the boy from the robes shop, the one who was an utter tosser. 


 


She spoke up, just wanting to slide into her compartment and be with her friends. 


 


""Who is asking?"" She coolly shoved past them despite her tiny frame and sat in her seat. 


 


""Oh, this is Crabbe and Goyle. And 

I

 am Draco Malfoy,"" he said, as if it was supposed to impress her. Ron snorted.


 


Draco glared. ""Think my name is funny do you? Red-haired, freckled face, and more children they can afford. Must be a Weasley.""


 


At this, both Ron and Dhatura stood up, quite furious. 


 


She seethed. ""I've quite enough of you, bugger off won't you?""


 


Draco stiffened. ""Potter, soon you will see what quality wizards look like, and it definitely isn't the likes of them, a Weasley and a Dumbledore. I'll forgive you when you come crawling back."" He smirked as if he would win, but Dhatura was too stubborn to even consider talking to him again. 


 


 That was the last straw. ""Come here again, even look at us the rest of the night, and I will cut off your pretty upturned nose.""


 


While she knew there was no need for violence, it both made her feel better, and knew that a young misguided slimy git like him would take it seriously. 


 


Before anyone could make a move, Goyle, who had been reaching for a chocolate frog in the background, screeched in pain. On his finger hung Scabbers the Rat, bravely biting the boy. 


 


Goyle swung the rat off, and the three disappeared in an instant. 


 


The compartment door opened, and it was Hermione, watching the aftermath of the whole fiasco. 


 


""What has been happening here? No one better be fighting!""


 


Ron, irritated, said, ""You again? What do you need?"" Apparently Hermione had been here before looking for Neville's toad. 


 


She sniffed. ""Just come to say that you'd better put your robes on now, The driver said we're nearly there.""


 


She exited and the girls and Ron took off to get changed. 


 


Dhatura looked out the window and had no idea what was in store for her future.


 


But she knew that what was in front of her was better than what was behind, and that was the best part. 


I will try to respond to comments now! Sorry for the wait, I'm just A Piece Of Garbage Sometimes. (Also its 4 am and I'm eating cold chicken and noodles like an asshole on my couch so i have nothing better to do.)

Thank you everyone once again!

I went back and edited some of the chapters myself. They're prolly still shit, but I'm trying y'all.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Chapter 6


 


The train slowed to a stop, and just as Dhatura tried and failed to once again lift her trunk, an older student with blue robes informed her that it wasn't necessary; all belongings were magically transported to their rooms. 


 


Dhatura, Ron, and Ariana stepped off of the train together, pushed around into the throng of people, eventually encountering Neville, who whimpered that he had lost Hermione in the rush. 


 


They shoved their way through the crowd of taller students, to the gigantic man yelling, ""Firs' years, firs' years over here!"" He spotted Dhatura in the crowd, and gave her a wink with his black beetle-like eyes.


 


The man was humongous, larger than any man could possibly be, with wraggly grey, dark hair spilling off into a beard. 


 


He roared again, ""Any more firs' years? No? Alrigh' follow me! Mind yer step!""


 


The large group of first-years stumbled their way down the steep dirt slope, so dark they decided together they must be surrounded by trees. 


 


Nobody spoke much, but Neville sniffled a bit, still worried about his toad.


 


The tall man, Hagrid as he introduced himself, shouted, ""Yeh'll be gettin' yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts jus' round the bend now!""


 


There was a loud round of 'oooh's and 'ahhh's as everyone took their first glances at the castle.


 


To Dhatura it was beyond description. It was magnificent, and beautiful. The lights cast off the mountains behind it, making it twinkle brighter than the closest star.


 


They reached a lake at the end of the path, where Hagrid announced, ""No more'n four t' a boat!""


 


So Ron, Dhatura, Neville, and Ariana tiptoed into a small boat together. After everyone was in, the large man, taking up his own boat, called the boats to go forward. 


 


The sight of Hogwarts from the lake was even greater as it drew closer. The lights reflected off of the rippling water and Dhatura felt she could name a more majestic sight. 


 


They reached their destination and clambered out of the boats. 


 


""Oi! Who's toad is this!"" The scraggly man exclaimed, causing Neville to almost collapse with relief and pent up stress as he was handed Trevor. 


 


They went up the passageway and up the stone steps. Making sure he had everyone, Hagrid gave the oak doors in front of them firm three knocks.


 


The doors swung open without pause, and gave Dhatura a most welcoming sight: Professor Minerva McGonagall.


 


""Thank you Hagrid I will take them from here.""


 


The doors opened wide for the students, and what they saw was wonderful. The Entrance Hall was so big it could fit Minerva's cottage in it. The stone walls were lit bright with torches, and McGonagall led them across the hall passed a marble staircase. They passed a door to the right, where they could hear the voices of hundreds, but Professor McGonagall led them to a small chamber. 


 


She looked over the crowd of young students, as they waited anxiously. 


 


""Welcome to Hogwarts,"" her guardian finally said, ""The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room.


 


""The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.


 


""The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.""


 


McGonagall looked over Neville and Ron's haphazard appearances, with a mussed up cloak and a dirty nose.


 


Then the professor looked over to Dhatura, and gave her a soft smile, then swishing right back out of the door. 


 


Dhatura whispered to Ariana, ""How do we get sorted again? Min-McGonagall never mentioned it.""


 


Ariana shrugged, glancing over at the pale Ron. ""Dunno. Uncle would never tell me, even if I begged him.""


 


Ron jumped in. ""Fred told me it hurts...""


 


They all shivered, listening to Hermione chant everything she had learned thinking it was a test of sorts. 


 


Just when Neville was about to open his mouth to respond, around twenty ghosts floated through the walls of the chamber, alerting the first-years.


 


They seemed to be in the middle of a conversation. 


 


A fat little monk was saying, ""Forgive and forget, I say. We ought to give him a second chance-""


 


A ghost wearing a ruff and tights cut him off. ""My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name  and you know, he's not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?""


 


None of the first-years answered. 


 


""New students!"" the ghostly monk exclaimed. ""About to be sorted, I suppose?""


 


He got a couple of nods. 


 


""Hope to see you in Hufflepuff! My old house you know!""


 


They heard a sharp voice appear at the door. ""Move along now. The Sorting is about to start."" McGonagall had returned, and the ghosts faded back through the walls. 


 


""Now form a line and follow me.""


 


They did as they were told, as nerves ran rampant. They walked in their line across the hall, and in through a pair of double doors leading into the Great Hall.


 


The hall was a splendid place. Lit by hundreds of candles floating above them, before them were four brightly colored tables parted by the stream of upcoming students. 


 


Above the candles was a perfect moving replica of the sky above, with a pale moon and dotting stars, only blocked by the occasional wispy cloud. 


 


Hermione saw her look and whispered, ""It's bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read it in Hogwarts: A History!"" Not wanting to be more rude than she was, and wanting to make a good impression on a potential friend, Dhatura refrained from rolling her eyes and saying something snarky. 


 


Instead, she nodded thankfully, equally impressed by the girl's knowledge.


 


She finally looked down again, as she saw McGonagall place a ratty old witch's hat on a stool upon the platform where the teachers sat. 


 


For a few seconds, there was only silence, until the hat twitches and came to life.


 


It began to sing in a jaunty voice:


 



Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,





But don't judge on what you see,





I'll eat myself if you can find





A smarter hat than me.





You can keep your bowlers black,





Your top hats sleek and tall,





For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat





And I can cap them all.





There's nothing hidden in your head





The Sorting Hat can't see,





So try me on and I will tell you





Where you ought to be.





You might belong in Gryffindor,





Where dwell the brave at heart,





Their daring, nerve and chivalry





Set Gryffindors apart;





You might belong in Hufflepuff,





Where they are just and loyal,





Those patient Hufflepuffs are true





And unafraid of toil;





Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,





If you've a ready mind,





Where those of wit and learning,





Will always find their kind;





Or perhaps in Slytherin





You'll make your real friends,





Those cunning folk use any means





To achieve their ends.





So put me on! Don't be afraid!





And don't get in a flap!





You're in safe hands (though I have none)





For I'm a Thinking Cap!



 


The song ended, and the hall burst with applause, and she heard the Weasley Twins whistling and shouting praise. 


 


The hat went still, and Professor McGonagall rolled out an ancient scroll. 


 


""When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,"" she said. ""Abbott, Hannah!""


 


A sweet looking girl with yellow pigtails and pink cheeks skipped up to the front, and placed the hat on her head. It fell down past her eyes as she sat down.


 


It only took a moment for Hannah to be announced, ""HUFFLEPUFF!""


 


""Bones, Susan!""


 


""HUFFLEPUFF!""


 


The motion kept going on, with a ""Boot, Terry!"" being placed in Ravenclaw and so on and so forth. 


 


She heard a ""Brown, Lavender!"" get placed in Gryffindor and a ""Bulstrode, Millicent!"" get placed in Slytherin. 


 


She tuned out until she heard ""Dumbledore, Ariana!""


 


Dhatura alerted herself. Ariana humbly walked to the hat, and within less than a minute it yelled ""HUFFLEPUFF!""


 


She clapped loudly with Ron for her friend.


 


Dhatura fancied that very few Slytherins were nice looking in the sense that if possible, they would beat anyone up who crossed their crooked paths. She held up hope for at least one of them to be nice enough. 


 


She saw Hermione get placed in Gryffindor, and Ron groaned beside her. 


 


Her godbrother Neville also scuttled over to Gryffindor after being placed there. 


 


She hadn't thought about what house she'd wanted, at one point wanting to got to Hufflepuff just to spite the blonde brat. They seemed like nice, welcoming people and she thought that she'd have a lot of fun, not to mention she would be with Ariana.


 


But Gryffindor seemed nice, and Ravenclaw was alright. She rejected the idea that she would ever fit into Slytherin. They seemed like a dark and broody type, and quite honestly, she'd already had enough of that for one lifetime. 


 


She saw the Malfoy kid get placed into Slytherin and wasn't surprised. She imagined his bullying personality would fit right in with them. 


 


There weren't many people left now. ""Moon""..., ""Nott""..., ""Parkinson""..., then a pair of twin girls, ""Patil"" and ""Patil""..., then ""Perks, Sally-Anne""..., and then, at last -


 


""Potter, Dhatura!""


 


She heard whispers break out across the enclave, and all eyes were on her. 

'Quite a lot of pressure,' 

the girl thought dryly. 


 


Minerva gave her an unnoticeable smile as she placed the hat over her eyes, and it did its job to calm her down a bit. 


 


She heard a small voice in her ear. ""Dhatura Lily Potter, nice to finally meet you!""


 


She felt perplexed. 


 


""Oh don't be confused, I'm just looking into your mind a bit."" Dhatura tensed. 


 


""Don't worry, everything stays nice and confidential. Just you and me. Now, let's see... You're quite a go-getter, wanting to learn more, but not driven by this... You're just curious... Conniving too, well, you have needed it out there where you were... Oh, Hufflepuff would be a good fit, but you're too mischievous. Perhaps that would be a good thing though...""


 


The hat trailed off. ""But I see a lot of bravery inside you, and the potential to do so much more with it... You would fit in well, like a glove, so better be GRYFFINDOR!""


 


The hat shouted the last word to the captive audience, and Minerva gave her a proud smile, ushering her off stage. She could hear the singing of the Weasley Twins, ""We got Potter! We got Potter!""


 


She looked over to Ariana, and they gave each other thumbs up, knowing they would still be friends because they told each other over letters that they would.


 


Dhatura sat herself beside Neville and across from Hermione, who sat next to the Patil twin who was placed in Gryffindor. 


 


She waited patiently for the other students to be placed, and a ""Thomas, Dean"" came and sat next to her after being sorted. 


 


""Weasley, Ronald!"" He placed the hat upon his ginger hair, and not a second later it yelled, ""GRYFFINDOR!""


 


The lasts sorting came and went, as ""Zabini, Blaise"", sat down at the end of the Slytherin table. 


 


Her stomach finally growled, as she gazed down at the golden plate in front of her mournfully. Dean beside her laughed at the pitious expression on her face.


 


Albus Dumbledore, eyes twinkly as always, stood and, with his normal gleeful expression said, ""Welcome! Welcome to a new year! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words! And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!""


 


Dhatura shook her head in amusement. ""What an odd man..."" 


 


The other first years around her nodded in agreement. 


 


The next thing they all knew, food appeared into existence in front of them, not unlike how Hellor could do at the McGonagall Cottage. 


 


Dhatura started to pile up foods. Mashed potatoes, roast beef, chicken, even a few foreign dishes. 


 


The ghost who wore the ruff slid across the table, speaking about how he wished he could eat food, and Ron added in, introducing him as Nearly Headless Nick. 


 


""I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -""


 


Seamus Finnegan, another boy sorted into Gryffindor that year, took a bite of chicken and asked, ""How can you be 'Nearly Headless'?""


 


The ghost looked hassled, as this seemed to happen every single year, for almost 500 years consecutively in fact. 


 


""Like this,"" he said, his irritable expression tipped with his head as it swung onto his shoulder. 


 


Dhatura chuckled and whispered over to Dean, ""I guess you could say it was a... 

hack job

...""


 


Dean, not expecting this, burst into laughter, alerting the whole table section to look at the two of them. She merely gave them all an innocent expression and went back to her meal.


 


After everyone ate as much as they could, the food faded away, and dessert popped up instead. Dhatura, still not accustomed to many sweet things, took some scoops of chocolate ice cream and was satisfied. 


 


They began to talk about families and she decided to sit this one out, just listening to the stories.


 


""I'm half-and-half,"" said Seamus. ""Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.""


 


They chortled along with him as he finished his statement. 


 


""Neville, what about you?""


 


""Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,"" said Neville, ""but the family thought I was a squib for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me - he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.""


 


Down the table a bit, she could hear Hermione bugging Percy about classes.


 


Dhatura, full to the brim, began to long for a bed to rest in, and looked up to the teacher's table. Hagrid was deep in a goblet, and Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking steadily. Next to them were a young man with a maroon turban on his head and another with long greasy hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. 


 


It happened suddenly, as she looked between the two men, a flash of pain shot across her scar. She held her head for a second, pretending to just fix her hair until the shooting pain faded.


 


Dhatura, feeling better, looked over to Percy and asked, ""Who are those two teachers next to McGonagall and Dumbledore?""


 


""Ah the one in the turban is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Quirrell, and the dark haired man is Professor Snape, the potions professor. Watch out for Snape, though, they say he knows a bit too much about the Dark Arts if you know what I mean.""


 


The desserts disappeared, and Dumbledore stood to his podium to talk to the masses of students. 


 


""Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.


 


""First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.""


 


Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.


 


""I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.


 


""Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.


 


""And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.""


 


Dhatura's eyes widened, not knowing what to make of such a grim warning towards such young students. 


 


The Headmaster moved on. ""And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!"" At this there seemed to be a shared grimace run through the teachers table.


 


""Everyone pick a favorite tune, and off we go!""


 


Dumbledore gave a flick of his want, and it sprouted a golden ribbon with words on it:


 



""Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,



 



Teach us something please,



 



Whether we be old and bald



 



Or young with scabby knees,



 



Our heads could do with filling



 



With some interesting stuff,



 



For now they're bare and full of air,



 



Dead flies and bits of fluff,



 



So teach us things worth knowing,



 



Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest,



 



And learn until our brains all rot.""



 


The school bellowed at different tempos, and ended at all different times, with the Weasley Twins being last singing along to a funeral march. 


 


Percy rounded all the first years into a line and corralled them up the beautiful marble staircase along with the other students of different years. Dhatura was too sleepy and her legs felt like they were being weighed down by all the food she ate to notice the moving portraits all  whispering around them. 


 


They came to a sudden halt when they saw a bundle of sticks began to float towards them.


 


""Peeves,"" Percy informed them, nudging the older prefects in front of them. ""A poltergeist.""


 


An older female prefect, Cleo Halls, raised her voice, ""Do you want me to get the Bloody Baron?""


 


There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.


 


""Oooooooh!"" he said, with an evil cackle. ""Ickle Firsties! What fun!""


 


He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.


 


""Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!"" barked Cleo, the 7th year prefect.


 


Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Percy's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.


 


""You want to watch out for Peeves,"" said Percy, as he shook off the attack. ""The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.""


 


At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.


 


""Password?"" she said.


 


""Caput Draconis,"" Cleo said. The girl was quite the leader. 


 


The portrait swung forward to reveal a round entrance in the wall. They all stepped through the portal and into a comfy red and gold common room, with a lovely fireplace and squishy chairs everywhere.


 


Percy directed the boys to their dorm, while Cleo showed them to theirs, and told them how the stairs worked to keep boys out. 


 


At the top of the staircase of the Gryffindor Tower, there were 6 four-poster beds, one for each of the girls. All of the girls changed into their pajamas, and visited the bathroom inside their dorm room. Dhatura told herself she would officially meet her roommates tomorrow when she wasn't so sleepy.


 


After they finished, they collapsed into their respective beds and into their respective dream worlds. 


Sorry I took a week to update again. I gave like 5 chapters in 4 days, but shit's been happening and I'm sick again. (It's my karma for gloating that I didn't get sick the last semester of my freshman year of college.)

I think I'm gonna aim for like a chapter a week? I dunno. It's not gonna be on a schedule, but I can guarantee that it will be often enough.

oookkkk so im very sorry. i went off and on writing this. also, college sucks, depression sucks, but you wanna know who's great? Lizzo that's all. sorry.


Chapter 7


 


Dhatura commonly woke with the rising of the sun, and the first day of classes was no different. 


 


She found she was awake before the other girls, took it as a blessing and started to get ready. She showered in hot water, brushed through her hair the best she could and got dressed. By the time she was finished, the other girls were just beginning to stir behind the curtains of their four-poster beds. . 


 


She began to sort through her things, and put the photos given to her by Dumbledore on the wall. 


 


The girls moved around her and chatter began to strike up among them. 


 


A girl named Kellah Aarons, a dark-skinned girl with a round face, asked Dhatura if she wanted to use her Lady Lock Magical Hair Brush For Textured Hair, saying that it would probably work better on her wild curls inherited by her father. 


 


Hermione, already dressed, was speed reading a textbook in her bed, with her uniform beginning to crinkle.


 


Lavender Brown and Parvarti Patil were hitting it off, showing each other their hair products and such. 


 


Fay Dunbar was a lively girl, but quiet unless talked to. Dhatura thought she could see herself getting along quite well with the fiery girl. 


 


Everyone except Hermione started to talk about upcoming classes, and uniforms, and whatever else under the sun. At one point, Dhatura consented to let Lavender and Parvarti wrangle her down in a chair and do her hair with help from Kellah. It ended up in a nicely wrapped bun at the crown of her head, with vines of hair floating down stylishly, or so Lavender explained. 


 


Hermione shut her book harshly, seemingly annoyed by the noise the girls made, and shoved it into her bag, rushing off to breakfast. Dhatura wasn't too perturbed, she understood that all of this was so new and it would take some time getting used to being around so many people just as weird as she was. 


 


After everyone else was finished getting ready, the five of them walked down to the Great Hall together, following the older students like lambs in order to find their way.


 


They found the other first-years at Gryffindor and sat down with them, eager to make friends. 


 


People around them whispered. 


 


""There, look.""


 


""Where?""


 


""Right there you numpty.""


 


""Wearing the glasses?""


 


""Did you see her face?""


 


""Did you see her scar?""


 


Dhatura supposed she had to get used to it. She was reluctantly famous here, and did not know how to handle it. 


 


After breakfast, the girls grouped together again, and followed the directions given to them by Cleo. 


 


This occurred day in and day out. Everyday the girls, who were becoming quite close as friends, would go to breakfast with the Gryffindor boys then wander to classes together. 


 


Well, all of the girls except for Hermione, who huffed to breakfast alone, then sped to class in order to get a seat at the front. 


 


Cleo told them how to not get lost, as there were a hundred and forty-two different staircases of different natures. She said, 

'when in doubt ask a portrait or a suit of armor.' 

She also said not to listen to anything Peeves said, because he would try to lead students off of the Astronomy Tower. 


 


Fred and George often gave the younger kids they liked advice like, ""Avoid Filch Like The Plague, Because He Probably Has The Plague,"" or ""Always Listen To Magical Medallions,"" but that one was probably just the twins taking the piss. 


 


Classes went fairly well. In fact, Dhatura excelled. She wasn't on Hermione's level, who was quite the bookworm, but she did fairly well in almost every class.


 


Astronomy was interesting, studying the stars at midnight every Wednesday. It was a lot more memorization that she expected, but that was perfect for her. Plotting the stars was literally magical. 


 


Charms with Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws was brilliant, but not very hard. All you needed to know was the incantation and wand movement. Dhatura would have liked to sit with Ariana, but instead she got sat with a Ravenclaw lad with a bigger head than Malfoy. 


 


Transfigurations with a mix of all four houses was difficult at first, but after some guidance from Professor McGonagall, she was one of the best in her class. She even made significant progress on turning her match into a needle, right alongside Hermione. Sadly Ariana was in the other Transfigurations class. (Dhatura learned Transfigurations, like most magic, was all about intention and being able to picture what you wanted in your mind.)


 


Herbology with the Hufflepuffs was fascinating; it was gardening but with more magic and a touch of danger. Ariana was also in her class, and they got to choose each other as partners. 


 


History of Magic with Ravenclaws would have been more interesting, learning about the culture of the world she hadn't known until the month before, but Professor Binns, a ghost, had the personality of a rock and the voice of a vacuum cleaner. 


 


They had all been looking forward to Defense Against the Dark Arts with a mix of the other houses, because it sounded dangerous and fun, but it was as boring as History of Magic. Quirrell was a joke of a man, always stuttering and evading questions about his adventures. He always smelled of garlic, and, for some reason, she always had a headache when he was around. 


 


It was the first Friday when they had their first potions lesson, in fact it was a double lesson with Slytherins. 


 


The girls once again joined the boys at the table, and they shared information about what the day was going to be like. 


 


""Snape's the potions professor. They say he always favors Slytherins because he's their head of house,"" Ron conspired. 


 


Dean humphed. ""Wish McGonagall favored us...""


 


Just then the mail arrived, and a brown tawny owl dropped a letter off for Dhatura. It vexed her a bit, because she knew it wasn't Minerva's owl, nor was it Lady Marshmallow, Ariana's psychotic beast. 


 


It dropped a note, stole a piece of her bacon out of her fingers and flew to sit on top of her head. 


 


""Bloody bird,"" she muttered. Needless to say, her luck with birds would never get any better. It nipped at her head for her rudeness. 


 


Dhatura saw Ariana smirking over at her from the Hufflepuff table and sighed to herself.


 


On the note dropped it read in the fanciful script of her guardian:


 



Miss Potter,



 



If you would like to come by next Friday, I know you have those afternoons off. Tea around 3?



 



Professor McGonagall



 



P.S. This is a Hogwarts owl. Esme is currently on business to the Ministry. 



 


Dhatura snatched a quill from her bag and scribbled her assent, saying she was looking forward to it, and shoved it to the bird on top of her head. It flew off, accidentally tugging on her hair as the talons had tangled into it. It tugged so hard, it dragged her off of the bench she had been sitting on. 


 


Dhatura clattered to the ground like a stack of cards beautifully built then blown over.


 


She hit the ground hard. She didn't get up right away.


 


Instead, she was pushed into old memories. 


 



'They were standing in the hallway. Vernon had accosted her as she exited the upstairs bathroom after cleaning it spic and span.



 



""Girl, what have you done this time! It says here you threw mud at a boy during break!""



 



In reality, the mud flew on its own, but she knew Vernon would hate her even more for that. 



 



Then, Dudley came thundering up the stairs. ""Daddy! Freak threw mud at Pier Polkis! She didn't even touch it but I know it was her! Daddy 

do 

something!""



 



Vernon was starting to turn purple. He was quite incensed this time. 



 



He grabbed her by her hair and dragged her to the top of the wooden stairs and-'



 


She was shaken out of the memory by a worried Ariana and Ron.


 


Dhatura blinked and McGonagall was upon them, towering high above the students knelt next to her, but ever worried about her, despite trying to hide it. 


 


Her friends helped her up and guided her to a bench as she shivered against them. The memories were too present.


 


""Everyone clear off. It's time for class. Ms. Potter, you may stay back,"" Ron and Ariana persisted. ""Ms. Dumbledore, Mr. Weasley, yes that means you. Run along.""


 


Everyone who had crowded her before dispersed at the sight of Minerva's glare. Ariana and Ron glanced at her, and she nodded, letting them know it was ok. 


 


Dhatura's ears rang. Her throat was sore like she had just screamed her head off. 


 


What a way to end her first week of classes at a new school where she's accidentally famous for killing someone as a baby. 


 


The shivering lessened after a few minutes, and after the food had popped off again, Minerva conjured a glass and water for her. 


 


The silence was finally broken, as only she and her guardian remained in the Great Hall. ""Ms. P- Dhatura, are you alright?""


 


""Y-yes. This isn't the first time, really, but the first time so many people have- er, witnessed this..."" She trailed off.


 


This had happened before, several times, and with different memories. Dhatura would be entranced, trapped into old memories of haunting events, and wake up just a few seconds later, knowing in her that she had screamed once again. 


 


All at once, her tears began to drown her, her breathing drew short and before she knew it, she began to quake once more. 


 


Minerva nodded to herself. ""It may not put you in his good books to skip your first Potions class, but it seems we need to visit the Hospital Wing.""


 


Dhatura, numb to reality, was guided around the castle by Minerva's hand on her back. 


 


As soon as they entered the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey ushered her in a whirlwind to a bed. The next thing she knew, she was being handed several potions, one after another. 


 


Madam Pomfrey explained the potions, but she was simply too exhausted to comprehend anything the healer said. 


 


She closed her eyes, wishing for the pounding in her head to go away.


 


***


 


She awoke to harsh whispers.


 


""... was screaming bloody murder. Has she ever told you much about her home life with the muggles?""


 


That was Ron's voice.


 


""Er- No, I don't know much. And it's not our business. Until she tells us, we are simply going to be here for her,

 right Ronald?

""


 


""Er- yeah sure. What's the muggle phrase? Be there or be square?""


 


Dhatura giggled sleepily.


 


The two immediately stopped their whispering and stood over her. ""Dhatura!""


 


""What time is it? I slept through class didn't I?""


 


Her two friends exchanged a look. Ron spoke up.""Uh, Dhatura? You slept for a whole day. It's Saturday morning. Pomfrey told us you were over-exhausted and stressed.""


 


She blinked. ""Oh.""


 


Pomfrey was alerted to her awakened patient. ""Ms. Potter! Ok, I'm just going to check you over and then you may take your daily potions and leave.""


 


Dhatura relaxed against the bed. ""Alright Madam Pomfrey.""


 


They went through the motions and she left with her friends. She was told she had missed breakfast, so she decided to just go up to her dorm real quick and grab her stash of candy alongside her school bag. 


 


They spent the weekend relaxing, joking, and finishing up work, Ron more reluctant than the other too. At one point he tried to play Exploding Snap by himself and scorched several of his fingernails. 


 


At one point, Dhatura bribed Fred and George to buy her some stuff from the prank store and candy store on their trip to Hogsmeade that weekend. 


 


Sunday was spent relaxing after their first week of classes. They lounged in the courtyard, wanting the sun but not wanting to walk all the way to the lake. It was probably going to be the last nice weekend before the rainy season of Scotland was upon them, and then indomitable winter. 


 


They laid out a blanket, and invited their friends to do the same. At one point, even Hermione, ever the recluse, hopped over and talked about how much she had missed in potions. Dhatura simply nodded along, as she was genuinely interested, but she had already read up on potions over the summer. 


 


The sun had begun to set, and they were due for dinner quite soon. It was only the three of them left; Dhatura, Ariana, and Ron watched the sun sink into the Scottish landscape. 


 


And honestly? Life had never felt so good.


 


***



Life continued in the same vague pattern. Enough to follow a weekly routine but allowing the groups of friends to get to know each other and explore the world within the castle. 


 


A week after her trip to the hospital wing, Dhatura finally attended her first double potions lesson.


 


They sat down at desks with massive cauldrons, she and Hermione left Ron with Neville in order to help Dhatura catch up with what she missed.


 


The potions lab was dark, with heavy drapery over what windows existed. Never had Dhatura seen a place that resembled the disgusting London homeless shelters so well, especially the cobwebs that no one decided to deal with and the grimy walls. 


 


Professor Snape swept in like a literal bat out of hell. 

Way to be dramatic, Professor, 

she thought to herself. 


 


Immediately, the dark professor took role, until he stopped upon her name in particular. 


 


""Ah, yes,"" he crooned, as if crafting an insult, ""Ms. Potter... Our newest... 

Celebrity

..."" 


 


He said this slowly, as if to be dramatic, but Dhatura thought he sounded obtuse, or perhaps had a stutter like Professor Quirrel, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.


 


The Slytherins all whispered together, sniggering amongst each other. 


 


He continued calling names, until all were present and accounted for. 


 


""Seeing as

 Potter

 missed the first class I shall repeat myself only once more; you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making...""


 



Wow, lovely man he is, 

Dhatura remarked to herself. 


 


""... As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly understand the beauty of the soft simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stop death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.""


 


Dhatura saw the smirk on his face, directed right at her. She knew this was some sort of challenge to be better than the rest but she had no idea why. 


 


She looked over to her fellow year mates while the silence loomed over the classroom. They all shrugged a long with her. And at that moment, she swore she was going to be the best at potions, just to prove Snape wrong, she wasn't a dunderhead, and to prove to Malfoy that she was the best witch of them all. 


 


""Potter!"" Snape barked. ""What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?""


 


You see, Dhatura had certainly paged through her texts while lounging around Minerva's cottage but this definitely seemed out of her reach as a first year. ""I don't know sir.""


 


He quizzed her several more times on things obviously above the curriculum, all the while Hermione was stretching her arm so high Dhatura thought that she was performing some weird yoga in the middle of class. 


 


All the same, she felt herself rising to the challenge, between having the sudden need to beat Hermione and to show Snape that she was better than he wanted her to be, because it seemed like he wanted her to fail.


 


And she was gonna fucking win. 








hi guys!!! this time its only been about a month.

also before reading this chapter, go back an reread the last one, i put the tail end of it onto this chapter bc i forgot that i wanted to include the flying lesson


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Chapter 8


 


The days came and went. Dhatura met the groundskeeper, Hagrid, who had led them across the lake on their first night at Hogwarts. She had tea with him often, occasionally dragging along one of her classmates. Dean especially liked to visit with her, as he loved Fang, Hagrid's massive dog. Dean liked to say that Fang was probably twice her size. She always scowled and attempted to take a crack at her rock cake that Hagrid made. 


 


One particular visit, the topic of the recent break in to the Gringotts Bank was brought up, but Hagrid quickly shut the conversation down. Ironically, Minerva did the same thing when the topic appeared again. Dhatura knew there was something going on, but knew that she would get nothing from any teacher. 


 


As time passed, the first year student body seemed to anticipate the coming of flying lessons with the Slytherins. The thought made Dhatura nervous, she'd never even TOUCHED a broom much less ride one. She'd seen one on display in Diagon Alley but had no idea what to make of it. So she listened as Ariana soothed her and Hermione ranted facts at her about brooms, quidditch and anything else she could get her hands on. Everyone else seemed excited, or impartial, except Fay Dunbar, who seemed quite shaky whenever the subject was brought up. Ron seemed to vibrate with excitement. 


 


The day came for flying lessons, a beautiful Thursday after at 3.30. Breakfast that day was spent listening to those in their little Gryffindor group who had grown up with such things. Despite having grown up a wizard, Neville seemed overly anxious that morning, which made sense to the rest of the group, as much as they enjoyed his boyish charm, he was notoriously clumsy. 


 


The mail came as it normally did, and a pretty barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly as they looked on, curious about the package. Neville showed off a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.


 


""It's a Remembrall!"" he explained. ""Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it like this and if it turns red - oh..."" Right when he said it, the ball turned a mystifying scarlet, ""... you've forgotten something..."" 


 


Looking him up and down, Dhatura noticed that he'd forgotten to put on his tie that morning. She opened her mouth to comment, only for Draco, who was passing by, to snatch the trinket out of the boy's hands. 


 


Everyone seemed to jump to his defense, Fay looking especially fiery. Before any moves could be made, Professor McGonagall sniffed out the trouble. 


 


""What's going on?""


 


""Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor,"" Neville trembled slightly afraid of confrontation. 


 


Draco put it back on the table with a scowl. ""Just looking."" He sauntered away, Crabbe and Goyle slumping their way behind him like 11 year old henchmen. 


 


***


 


Three thirty came with the bang of the door of the Great Hall slamming open as the group of students left their last class and rushed to the grounds for their first flying lesson. Dhatura walked with Kellah Aarons who explained quidditch to her more in depth and without overwhelming her with information like Hermione typically did. 


 


As they came onto the flat lawn, they found the Slytherin students to already be there, along with around 20 broomsticks laid out on the ground in 2 lines. Dhatura knew to pick her broom carefully, as Fred and George, as well as many of the other quidditch players around, complained about the quality of the school brooms. Some apparently vibrated if you went too high, or veered slightly to the left. 


 


Their teacher, Madam Hooch, swept up quickly, with short grey hair and yellow eyes that seemed to watch their every move like a hawk. 


 


""Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on hurry up!"" Draco Malfoy sniggered, already at a stick, thinking that being barked at by a teacher is funny as if he wasn't scolded this morning by Professor McGonagall.


 


With everyone lined up at a broom, Hooch began. ""Stick out your dominant hand over your broom and say 'UP!'""


 


Everyone shouted at various times 'UP!'


 


Dhatura's broom shot right into her hand leaving her staggering backwards a bit. She was one of few. Hermione's rolled a bit, Fay's wobbled to her, and Neville's hadn't moved an inch. Dean's seemed to come to him the second time at least. 


 


Madam Hooch then showed them how to properly mount a broom without sliding off or hurting oneself.  Dhatura grinned at an unamused Hermione and a giggling Ron when Hooch sniped at Draco for doing it wrong and arguing with her about it. 


 


""Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, then come straight down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two -""


 


She never got to one, as nervous Neville, at the thought of having to fly, pushed off of the ground before the whistle was blown and began to float. 


 


""Come back boy!"" Dhatura raised a concerned eyebrow for her god-brother. He got to twenty feet, white as a sheet. Then he gasped, and slid off of the broom with a WHAM and a CRACK. 


 


Neville lay face down on the grass, shivering. The broomstick continued to fly higher and out of sight into the Forbidden Forest. 


 


Hooch helped up Neville, and muttered to herself about a broken wrist. She turned to the rest of the class. ""None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.'"" And she ushered a tear-stained Neville off and into the castle again. 


 


The second they were through the doors, Malfoy began to snigger. ""Did you see his face, the great lump?"" The other Slytherins tittered about. 


 


""Shut up Malfoy!"" Parvarti snapped. 


 


""Never knew you were into fat cry babies, Patil,"" Pansy Parkinson sneered.


 


""Look! It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."" The Remembrall glittered in his hand as he picked it up. 


 


Dhatura truly wondered if the boys here were crazy or if she were too normal. 


 


She took a step towards the arrogant boy. ""Give it here, Malfoy. Quickly and I'll think about not decking you."" She'd met bigger arses in the alleys of London. Nothing he could do could scare her. 


 


""HA. Nice try

 Potter

, come and get it!"" He mounted his school broom and began to hover. 


 


""Give it here or I'll knock you off of that broom!"" 


 


Malfoy sneered. ""Oh yeah?""


 


Somehow, Dhatura just 

knew 

what to do, no hesitation needed. She shot at Draco like an arrow, while Hermione squeaked nervously from the ground to stop what she was doing. Malfoy moved out of the way quickly, and a few people below clapped at her flying. 


 


""None of your lackeys up here to save you, 

Draco.

"" He paled a bit, coming to the same realization. 


 


""Then catch this!"" And she dove. 


 


She felt like she was moving in slow motion. Dhatura kept her eye on the ball, flying after the small trinket for Neville, and caught it just in time to pull up before crashing. To her it felt like skill, not a miracle. It was exhilarating. 


 


The energy left her as she toppled to the ground, not quite knowing how to stop and dismount a broom just yet. 


 


Then she heard one of the scariest noises she's come to known since moving in with Minerva; ""

DHATURA LILY POTTER.""



 


She stilled. She was in deep shit.


 


***


 


This wasn't the first time Minerva was mad at her. Like the time Minerva walked in on her trying to float herself to the ceiling after flipping through her charms book and wanted to fly. Or the time she

 harmlessly

 switched the sugar and the salt for the day with the help of Hellor, who grew a liking for the young girl. 


 


So naturally, she knew that hearing that yell meant trouble for her. 


 


""Ms. Potter, in all my time... could have broken your bloody neck... what would Lily think dear lord... "" Dhatura knew she was furious. 


 


""It wasn't her fault, prof-""


 


""Quiet Ms. Patil.""


 


""But, Malfoy sta-""


 


""ENOUGH, Mr. Weasley. Ms. Potter follow me"" Nice of Ron to speak on her behalf but she was already doomed. 


 


The Slytherins looked too happy with the outcome. Draco had been on a broom too, why wasn't he getting the third degree too. 


 


They were deadly silent as Minerva marched her to the castle. She was going to be expelled. Or have her magic taken away. She would have to live on the streets again. Dammit. 


 


She didn't look up while Minerva led her through the castle like a lamb to the slaughter. They stopped outside of a classroom and the professor stuck her head inside. ""Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I please borrow Wood for just a moment?"" 


 


Was Wood some sorta cane to punish idiot students?


 


Instead, out came a burly, heavily eyebrowed boy with dark hair. He looked down at her with confusion. 


 


""Follow me, both of you.""


 


They shuffled into a classroom where Peeves was scribbling rude words onto the blackboard. ""Out, Peeves!"" Minerva barked. 


 


The poltergeist nailed Wood in the forehead with the chalk and cackled, going through the wall spouting some rather

 imaginative

 curses. 


 


""Dhatura, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I found you a new seeker!"" Professor McGonagall proclaimed. 


 


The puzzlement on Wood's face smoothed out into one of joy and delight. ""A-are you for real, Professor?""


 


The woman let out the teensiest smile, ""As real as I can be, Mr Wood. She's a natural. Should have known, despite it being her first time on a broom.""


 


""Well, I tried my best, I suppose.""


 


""Now, Ms. Potter don't be shy now of all times. You caught that,"" she referenced to the Remembrall clenched tightly in her fist, ""in a fifty foot drop. There's no time to play coy or downplay anything. Charlie Weasley couldn't have even done it."" She says the last part to Wood. 


 


""Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?"" he asked excitedly.


 


""Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,"" Professor McGonagall explained.


 


""She's just the build for a Seeker, too,"" said Wood, now walking around Dhatura and staring at her 4'1 frame. ""Light - speedy - we'll have to get her a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.""


 


""I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks ...""


 


She nodded to herself. ""Wood, back to class, Dhatura, with me."" 


 


***


 


They sat for tea, and Dhatura wasn't sure if Minerva was still angry with her. 


 


""Dhatura, your father would have been so proud"" She snapped her head up to look at Minerva. 


 


""W-w-"" Dhatura could only stutter. 


 


""He played quidditch. He was a chaser though. But he would have been so happy to have seen you on that broom, Dhatura..."" Minerva looked like she was caught in the past. 


 


""Min- Professor McGonagall... Could you please tell me about them... My parents?"" With that plea, the two were caught up in story after story as Minerva regaled the young girl with the brightest, fondest images of the people she should have known. 


 


***


 


""Are you sure you wanna do this, Dhatura?"" Hermione questioned her. The three of them, including Ariana, sat at the end of the Hufflepuff table eating dinner with Ariana at her table, instead of the usual Ariana shuffling over to Gryffindor. 


 


From the Slytherin table, she could see Draco Malfoy glaring daggers at her, but seemed too afraid to confront the headstrong girl again today. 


 


Dhatura rolled her eyes. ""Yes. I'm sure. This just feels right. I'm actually pretty excited. And, y'know, whatever keeps me outta any actual trouble, right?""


 


Ariana nodded. ""Not to mention- Hogwarts youngest house player in over a hundred years. If she's as good as she was today, that's pretty significant.""


 


Hermione shook her head, and her normal massive puff of hair moved with her in a comical fashion, but neither girl commented, simply used to the gravity defying hair. As if Dhatura's hair wasn't as hard to deal with. 


 


""I start my training next week, but Wood is keeping it a secret. Apparently, I'm gonna be a secret weapon.""


 


With that said, the Weasley twins spot Dhatura at the end of the Hufflepuff table and swerve to talk to her. 


 


For once, they lowered their voices, knowing that the information they had was not meant to be boasted. ""We heard! Our little Potter is the seeker!"" 


 


""We're gonna win the Quidditch Cup for sure this year!""


 


""We haven't won since Charlie, our older brother, left Hogwarts but-""


 


""-this year the queen has come to save us from despair!""


 


Ariana and Dhatura looked at one another and giggled at the normal royalty jokes that typically sprouted from the twin jokers. 


 


""Anyway, we've got to go, your Highness. Lee thinks that we're making a breakthrough in a prank we have going on. Let-""


 


""-us know if you'd like to join in! Could-""


 


""-be fun! Smell ya later!"" Fred exclaimed. 


 


""Fred, we've talked ab-"" And the rest of their conversation faded as they trotted away. 


 


Dhatura pulled a thinking face. ""Might take them up on that... Sounds like it could be a fun time...""


 


""Honestly, Dhatura, you're too smart to do those kinds of things,"" Hermione tutted.


 


""Nah, 'Mione, it's about using your smarts to your advantage, especially when having fun. And what's a few harmless pranks here and there? Not like I'm gonna start a pranking dynasty and take the school by storm.""


 


Dinner ended quietly, and they parted ways with Ariana, heading up to the Gryffindor tower. The first years wrangled their way to take the spot by the fire. They hung around, absentmindedly doing work, playing Exploding Snaps and in general just relaxing after such a high tension day. 


 


The rest of the night passed by slowly and with Dhatura's new found motivation to study kicking in, Ron seemed to lag behind her. 








In the coming weeks, she tended to spend most of her time in study groups dedicated to one subject or another, always accompanied by Ariana and Hermione, who was a lot more pleasant than she started out being. The only problem was that Hermione was determined to show off, while Dhatura was perfectly fine knowing her own worth as a student.


 


Ron was definitely not interested in studying, much less school. He was there for the adventure, which Dhatura respected, and while she was definitely there for that too, she also wanted to go above and beyond any teacher's expectations. 


 


Time went on and Halloween approached when disaster struck and sides were taken. 


 


The 3rd week of October rolled around, and all anyone was talking about was Halloween or midterm exams. Determined to place better than the rest, she found herself barely sticking her head outside of her books. 


 


Sitting in the common room with her face stuffed into an ancient potions book labeled ""Potions Ingredience and How They Art Made"" by Millingtub Millfin. She was shaken out of a quite interesting passage about bezoars and their effects on different poisons when she felt the couch she was on shift weight.


 


""Dhatura... Mate... Ar-are we still friends? You spend all your time with other people, I know you're famous and all but... We are friends aren't we? Because Fred and George keep telling me that...""


 


She stopped him there. ""Why in the three goddess's names would you listen to your devilish brothers?""


 


He looked upset by that. ""Well at least they talk to me, unlike you. All you do is shove your face in books and giggle with Hermione and Ariana all the time. Some days you don't even acknowledge me...""


 


Dhatura snorted at that. ""Well at least I'm not studying. I came to learn, not constantly slack around with you or your brothers."" She winced at her own harshness towards Ron.


 


Ron's face turned red. ""Well at least I 

have

 brother's to slack around with.


 


Every Gryffindor in the common room froze at that, not knowing how she would react. While a short silence moved throughout every once of the space like magic, Ron's red anger faded into pale guilt and nervousness.


 


She handled it like she handled everything, with an extraordinary amount of grace. ""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?"" 


 


Dhatura never pulled punches, not while living in the streets, not while living with Minerva, and definitely not when people brought up her parents' deaths, especially when the anniversary of their deaths was a week away. In fact until then that subject had been quite ardently avoided. 


 


Hermione popped up from the chair 5 feet away and began to drag a rowdy Dhatura up the stairs towards the dormitory. The rest of the girls in the first year dorm followed, giving Ron the stink eye meanwhile, in order to make sure she was okay. The rest of the common room broke out in whispers, all peering at him.


 


Sides were taken, bets offered (mainly by Fred and George, of course), and in the mix, Ron turned up mostly alone, with only Seamus on his side, amongst a few upper year boys who told Ron that women were not to be understood. He didn't quite agree nor understand but knew better than to drive them away. 


 


He knew what he said. He regretted it as soon as he said it. He didn't know what to do.


 


And then Halloween came.

Remus was very secretive and loved to read late into the night. He was also hiding a sketch book under his mattress that everyone else pretended not to know about.

Peter had a considerable stash of sweets that he had given them limited access too (no more than three a day!). His mother kept sending him muggle games that they had a lot of fun playing until late into the evening, even if it usually took ages until they understood the rules. They were getting faster, though.

James was a lovable goofball and just about the most disorganized person Sirius had met so far. He usually left things lying around all over their dorm, so Sirius was very surprised to see him clean up his mess without any prompting on a Saturday morning.

He was even humming to himself. It was weird.

""What are you doing?"" the young Black questioned.

""I'm cleaning,"" James answered cheerfully.

""I can see that. But why?"" Peter asked, frowning.

""Because divali is starting on Friday and I'm not sure I will have time to do it later.""

Remus leaned his head to the side. ""Diwali? What's that?""

James seemed to be shocked at the questionable looks on the faces of the other three boys. ""You don't know what divali is? I get that you're not Hindu and that it's not as common here as it is in India, but you seriously haven't hears of it? Dadi would be horrified. Diwali is by far her favourite."" He shook his head.

Peter shook his head. ""Uh, no. Should we?""

""For reasons other than your grandmother's mental state?"" Sirius added.

James threw his hands into the air and moved them down his head. ""It's the festival of lights and one of the happiest events in India and I'm sure other places too. It's a festival of peace and charity. We're celebrating the victory of hope over despair, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, essentially of light over darkness.""

""Sounds interesting, but, er, what does that have to do with the cleaning?"" Sirius scratched the back of his head.

""It's part of the tradition. Which reminds me. Would you terribly mind if I were to put up some candles throughout Friday night?""

""Not particularly, since the beds all have curtains, but why?""

""On Friday it will be the new moon and the end of the months Ashvin. This marks the birthday of Lakshmi -- Goddesses of wealth and prosperity -- and Dhanvantari -- God of Health and Healing. You put on some lights if you want them to visit you and leave you gifts and blessings. You also prepare sweets and delicacies as offerings,"" James explained.

""Would you like some of my stash for that?"" Peter offered.

""Thank you for your offer, but McGonagall offers time for me and the other students that celebrate it to make the Mithai, the treats ourselves next Saturday after we're done with the rituals."" James fidgeted nervously, ""I just hope I do those correctly without Maan looking over my shoulder, it's important for a good year.""

""I'm sure you will,"" Remus reassured him."
