Freds dead. Percy now has survivors guilt and George isn't a twin anymore. 

Teddy Lupin is now an orphan. Mommy and daddy died in the battle. 

Parvati lost her best friend. Her loyal companion. 

First years died in that battle. 

The little boy with that camera died with courage. 

Andromeda lost all her family. Ted, lupin, Tonks, Bellatrix. 

The golden trio came back with scars. Far too many scars. 

He lost a brother. He lost his childhood. He lost his first girlfriend. He's the one you call The King. A king who fought for his people. A battle that many would lose. 

She almost lost her mind. Her childhood for sure. The Brightest Witch of her Age they call her. With far too much knowledge. Things she's seen, whispers she's heard. Ignorance is bliss and how many times she wished she knew that. 

The boy who lived...twice. The war took much from him. Uncle moony. Uncle padfoot. He is happy that the war is over but the pain is immense. He watched his friends suffer and himself. They took so much from a mere teenager.

Sometimes they wished they were dead and who wouldn't. 

They were just kids who had to grow up too fast. 

They were seventeen. 

 

Are we too young for this?

Harry and his parents---Fred and George Weasley

And you're still...

 

I was one and you were twenty-one.

Now I'm forty-one and you will always be twenty-one

----

We were twenty.

Now I'm forty- three and you're still twenty.

Well that's not fair. 

 

What if Regulus could see it all in the afterlife? 

What if he saw James grieve him? 

What if he watched his brother blame himself. 

What if he watched James move one? Have a kid and find someone else? 

What if he could see James slowly move on yet he was stuck? 

What does that feel like? 

Does it feel like your heart breaking into a million pieces and cutting your stomach? 

Does it feel like gasping for air and never getting it? 

Does it feel like wanting to scream but no power to do so? 

Does it feel like wishing for death?

Watching your soulmate not need you anymore? 

Or was he happy? 

Happy that James found love somewhere else? 

A life that he almost lived? 

Could he see James die? 

Would they be reunited in the after life? 

Or would he chose Lily?

 

Well that's not fair.

This personally broke my heart.

Will you hold me tight and not let go? 

 

Bellatrix Lestrange. 

A name that would always haunt him. Whether it be in his dreams or at home. 

Her name was a reminder that he lost nearly everything. He lost a happy childhood. A childhood that could've been filled with cookies and hugs. A childhood where his mom would take him to the park. One where he would wait for his dad to come back from being a superhero. 

A childhood where he was loved instead of thrown off a balcony to prove he had magic. 

A childhood where his dad would've taught him to fly instead of having to visit him at a hospital each weekend. 

Wondering why it was grandma and not his parents dropping him off to his first year. His family was ripped from him before he could say daddy. 

He wondered if Alice could hear him. 

Hear him crying and yelling. 

Question plagued his mind most days. 

Would they be at his wedding? At his graduation? 

Harry wasn't the only one who saw a family in the Mirror of Erised. 

 

Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Gods, he's my favorite character.

Did you get enough love? 

 

Harry Potters stupid friend. The Weasley boy. Second choice.

What must it take to be recognized? A lot 

It takes winning a war at seventeen for people to stop treating you like shit. 

The war nearly killed us. It took so much from us. From me. 

Not many will know what it's like to be on the run, being hunted. 

Not many will understand that we were just kids pretending to be adults. 

We were frightened beyond measure. 

We were in pain. 

Traumatized. 

We stopped being kids the day we almost got killed. 

Sometimes I can feel my throat sore from screaming at the manor. 

Sometimes I get flashbacks of those dark months. 

Sometimes I can't get out of bed. 

Hermione got us three into therapy. 

Bottles of pills sit on the shelf. 

No one really asked if we were okay. They just asked if it was over. 

No one really asked if we needed help. 

Not until they saw it. 

Not until they saw the reality of our states. Of mine. 

- Ron Weasley 

 

Did you get enough love?

Yep, Taylor Swift. Anyone can ignore this one. It was just kind of the moment thing.

Traitor 

 

James: Did you have to do this? 

Sirius: I was thinking that you could be trusted. 

Remus: Did you have to ruin what was shining, now it's all rusted. 

Lily:  Did you have to hit us?

James: Where I'm weak? Peter, I couldn't breathe. And rub it in so deep.  

Sirius: Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me 

James: Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

Remus: Did you think that we'd be fine 

Sirius: Still got scars on my back form your knife 

Sirius: So don't think it's in the past. These kind of wounds they last and they last. 

Remus: Now did you think it all through. All these thing will catch up to you. 

Lily: And time can heal but this won't  

Sirius: You say sorry just for show

I'm in my bed



 


Severus's mind flashed to Lily; her smile, her laugh, her immense beauty. He remembers when they were 12 and laid on his bed while his dad was away, laughing about some silly thing like children do. 


 



And you're not here

 


 


He was angry, and 16, freshly humiliated.


 


""-mudblood!"" he snarled, a dark flush on his cheeks from being hung upside down by those blasted Marauders. Once the words slipped out, Severus immediately regretted it. 


 


Lily's eyes grew wet, a sight Severus wished he never had to see, and Lily stormed off. 


 



And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands



 


He screamed as he held Lily's body in his arms, the similar cries of her child in the crib next to him. It was his fault, he was the one who told the Dark Lord about that fucking prophecy! Something broke inside Severus, neither the Dark Lord nor Dumbledore protected her like he had asked, and it was all his fault, Severus wished he never heard that prophecy in Aberforth's pub. 


 



Forget what I said, it's not what I meant

 


 


""Lily! I'm sorry, I didn't-"" 


 


""Oh so you didn't mean to call me mudblood several days ago!"" Lily shot back at Severus. ""If you didn't mean it, why'd you say it! I thought we were friends Sev, but friends don't say stuff like that to each other."" Her green eyes watered and tears fell, her voice shook. 


 


And she walked away. 


 



And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

 


 


The Dark Lord slipped up to Severus, his chocolate brown hair falling slightly into his eyes. ""You want me to do what, Severus?"" 


 


""Please, My Lord,"" Severus said, kneeling with his forehead touching the floor. ""Spare Lily, please, I beg you."" 


 


Severus shook slightly under the Dark Lord's gaze. ""You do understand, Severus,"" the Dark Lord said coldly. ""That this request will have a price."" 


 


""I do, My Lord."" 


 


Smirking patronizingly at Severus, the Dark Lord fired a 

Crucio

 at Severus, and his screams filled the study room. 


 



What am I now? 



 


Severus writhed on the floor, he had failed to make a sufficient potion for the Dark Lord. 


 



What am I now?

 


 


He watched as the skinny form of Harry Potter walked up to the sorting hat. Severus thought he would never see those eyes again. 


 



What if I'm someone I don't want around? 



 


""Potter, our new....celebrity."" 


 


It almost hurt him the amount of confusion in Lily's eyes, no recognition that he would've normally seen from Lily. This notion made Severus angry, the Potter spawn didn't deserve to hold her eyes. 


 



I'm falling again,

 


 


Halloween, the anniversary of his best friend's end. 


 



I'm falling again, 



 


""

Crucio

!"" the Dark Lord sent a spell to a muggle woman, Severus had to occlude or it would be him next. 


 



I'm falling.

 


 


Severus saw Nagini arching her neck as she striked at his neck, and he felt her fangs sink into his neck, time and time again. 


 



What if I'm down?

 


 


Severus coughed, pain shooting up his arm with the Dark Mark, he was being summoned. The Dark Lord was angry. 


 



What if I'm out?

 


 


He winced as Lily pressed a wet cloth on his eyebrow, Potter and Black had ganged up on him and pushed him down the stairs. Severus could almost say that it was worth it for the gentle smile that he received from Lily. 


 



What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

 


 


""What about your old friend Snivellus?"" Potter said. Severus was behind a corner, listening to them, and he heard Lily make unsure noises. 


 


""It doesn't matter, let's just go to the library."" She said, changing the subject, and Severus could hear her drag the stumbling Potter away. 


 



I'm falling again, 



 


Severus sent a potion bottle to the wall, he was such an idiot, he never should have believed Lucius about the Dark Lord, it was a mistake. 


 



I'm falling again,

 


 


""Clear your mind, Potter!"" Severus snarled at the boy. 


 


Lily's eyes grew angry, and Potter repelled the legilimens spell, revealing the memory of being hung upside down. Severus shoved the insolent boy out. 


 



I'm falling. 



 


He coughed as blood from his neck started choking him. That damn snake really knew where to bite someone in the best places to kill them. 


 



You said you care

 


 


""You're such a good friend Sev!"" 10 year old Lily giggled. ""Let's promise to stay friends forever, ok?"" 


 


Severus smiled. ""Ok, I promise."" 


 



And you missed me too

 


 


""I wish I knew my mother,"" Potter spawn said, with Severus eavesdropping into the conversation in the dining hall. ""I always hear things about my father, but never my mother."" 


 


Severus's eyebrows furrow, why would no one ever tell him about his mother? Perhaps, an anonymous letter should be sent, even though he was a brat, he deserved to know. 


 



And I'm well aware that I write too many songs about you

 


 


12 year old Severus smiled in his room, writing in his journal, definitely not a diary, about his day with Lily. Just about every entry had her, especially during school times. 


 



And the coffee's out

 


 


He stood in the blown up house that was Lily's, panic and fear shooting through every nerve. She can't be dead, both the Dark Lord and Dumbledore said they would protect her! 


 



At the Beachwood Cafe

 


 


The younger Potter sat, laughing with his friends about something, butterbeer froth on their lips. A painful nostalgia filled Severus's heart, seeing Lily's eyes light up with the glee he used to see as a teenager. Severus slipped out right after he entered, no one but Harry having seen him. 


 



And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

 


 


Lily lay on the soft grass, right next to Severus, a companionable silence between them as they looked at the starry sky. 


 



What am I now?

 


 


Lucious smirked as Severus accepted to join a Death Eater meeting, turns out offering acceptance to the poor half-breed would do the trick so nicely. 


 



What am I now?

 


 


A pang of regret goes through Severus as he sees the Potter spawn get burned by his godson's own cruelty of slipping something into Potter's cauldron, but it was gone as quick as it came. 


 



What if I'm some I don't want around? 

 


 


Severus felt sick as he heard the muggles screams of pain that he was causing. Ever since he went to Dumbledore, torturing someone has made him sick, he thought he got used to it, but now he has to fight to keep his face clear. 


 



I'm falling again, 



 


He slid down the glass, leaving a trail of blood on it. 


 



I'm falling again,

 


 


The fuzzy presence of complete occluding filled his head as he screamed on the ground from the Dark Lord's 

crucio

 and legilimization of his mind, he had to keep him out, especially with the new amount of secrets he had. 


 



I'm falling.

 


 


""Professor!"" Potter cried out softly, trying to stop the bleeding at his neck. He truly wasn't what Severus thought him to be. 


 



What if I'm down?

 


 


""Are you ok Severus?"" Lily asked, hand held out to help him up after he had tripped, the sun behind her only highlighting her beauty, and Severus's heart sped up, why was his heart doing that? 


 



What if I'm out? 



 


Severus's head snapped back from the force of his father's hand. ""Stupid freak boy! What have I told you about using your fucking 

magic

!"" His father yelled drunkenly. 


 


Young Severus stayed on the ground, eyes riveted on his father so he could prepare to protect himself should his father start hitting again. 


 



What if I'm someone you won't talk about?



 


""C'mon mate,"" Weasly said to Potter while they brewed. ""What did your blasted relatives really do to you during the summer?"" 


 


""Nothing,"" Potter snapped. ""Just drop it, we have to avoid getting detention again."" 


 


Severus's eyes narrowed at Potter from his dark corner, he could only just barely see a black eyes under what looked like a layer of make-up. 


 



I'm falling again,

 


 


A growl came from behind him, leading to Severus turning around slowly. His eyes widen and his jaw drops, Lupin was a fucking werewolf. 


 



I'm falling again,



 


He saw Lily walking through the hallways, her hand snugly in Potter's hand. 


 



I'm falling. 



 


Severus's tongue stuck out, this was a very important potion that Slughorn was having them do. An arm struck his side sharply, causing him to stumble and his cauldron moved, and fell. The boiling potion spilled onto his arm, searing through his uniform. 


 



And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

 


 


His owl dropped the Daily Prophet in front of him, showcasing a large picture on the front of Lily and James. They had gotten married. 


 


Tears pricked at the corners of Severus's eyes, but he buried them deep into his mind, not letting them fall. ""Blast it all."" He choked out, it was all that damn Potter's fault.


 



What am I now?



 


Severus scrambled over to Draco's bleeding body on the bathroom floor. He stared at Potter, looking him in the eyes, seeing guilt and panic, something that never would have been in Potter Sr.'s eyes.


 



What am I now? 



 


""I am the Half-Blood Prince."" Severus said, melancholy only to his ears. 


 



What if you're someone I just want around? 



 


The gravestone for Lily seemed to stare back at him, it was a tradition to come back here once every summer. Severus wished he could hold her in his arms one more time and apologize. 


 



What if I'm down?



 


Dumbledore fell back over the railing, falling to his death. It was all part of the plan, his only regret was that Potter had to witness it. It felt like Lily herself was watching through his eyes.


 



What if I'm out? 



 


""Take it."" Severus gurgled out to Potter, tears containing his memories leaking out, and he stared pleadingly at him. Lily's eyes stared back at him, showing the same pain he had seen all those years ago when he made his fatal mistake with Lily that day by the tree.


 



What if I'm someone you won't talk about? 



 


""Slimy git."" Potter muttered as he walked past Severus in the halls. Severus couldn't help but think he deserved it, if only to atone for what he had done to Lily. 


 



I'm falling again, 



 


Severus watched as Potter yelled at him in the dining hall, looking dirty and worn out, his beige jacket smeared with dirt and some blood. The anger in his eyes, in Lily's eyes, speared Severus's soul. 


 



I'm falling again, 



 


He walked away from the burning house, body numb. Why was he walking away, he was leaving her child, 

Lily's child

, in there. Why could he not turn back to get her child. But he kept walking. 


 



I'm falling.



 


Blood filled his lungs more and his vision was going black, and looked at Potter, Potter's image flickering between him and Lily. Why was it just now that he saw the subtle red highlights in his hair, the small freckles on his cheeks that Lily had, the slight figure that Lily had, all down to the emerald green eyes that had the same flecks of gold in them. 


 


Severus opened his mouth to say something, anything. Maybe an apology, about his regrets, his wishes, just 

something

. 


 


""You have your mother's eyes."" He choked out. 


 


He could see the small tears in Li-no, Harry's eyes, a faint smile on his face filled with pain, yet also understanding. 


 


Severus closed his eyes, falling into the soft blackness, knowing that he couldn't atone for anything he had done, he didn't deserve this child's kindness, but he had received it anyways, because he had been wrong. Harry wasn't Lily, and he wasn't his father, he was just Harry. With that, Severus succumbed to the mansions of rest.


Harry Potter



Loving and fighting, accusing, denying



 


Hermione and Ron yelled at each other again. Ron kept saying that Hermione's cat ate his rat, it was starting to wear Harry down, but he wouldn't trade it for the world.


 



I can't imagine a world with you gone



 


Harry sat in his chair, the sounds of the forest echoing around him. Somehow, Ron and Hermione were laughing over something, and despite being wanted criminals, Harry felt happy, he doesn't know where he would be without them. 


 



The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of 



 


His small feet slapped across the sidewalk, the jeers of his cousin and friends as they played Harry Hunting behind him. Harry couldn't let them get him or he would go home with bruises and chores would be even harder to complete. He didn't want Uncle Vernon to get mad or he would just go to bed in his cupboard even more bruised and maybe bloody. 


 



I'd be so lost if you left me alone



 


""Harry, the essay topic is right here, in this book, not that book."" Hermione cried, an affronted look on her face. 


 


""Oh, sorry 'mione."" He said sheepishly, he had honestly spaced out and grabbed the wrong book. 


 



You locked yourself in the bathroom 



 


""

Sectumsempra

!"" Harry yelled, shooting the spell at Malfoy. He watched as Malfoy was sent back, and then the blood pool beneath Malfoy, fear slipping out from Malfoy in whimpers. Harry didn't mean it, he didn't even know what that spell did! 


 


Snape walked through not even a minute later and made eye contact with Harry over Malfoy's body, strange emotions flickered through Snape's eyes, but Harry left before he could figure them out. 


 



Lying on the floor when I break through



 


The voice, what was that voice. What is the murder it's talking about? Harry follows it, dimly aware of his friends behind him, until he is splashing through a large puddle and sees Mrs.Norris laying eerily still on the floor. 


 



I pull you in to feel your heartbeat



 


Harry sobbed in his crib as a sharp green light cut through the hair towards his mother who threw herself in front of him. What was happening? He wanted his mummy to hold him! 


 



Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me



 


A man in dark robes screamed and sobbed over his mother, making Harry keep crying, why was his mummy so still? Where was Daddy? Why were there bodies too still in front of him?


 



Hold on, I still want you



 


Snape sent Dumbledore over the railing, letting him fall to his death. Grief ripped through Harry's chest, and he didn't make a sound. Snape had just murdered Dumbledore! 


 



Come back, I still need you



 


Harry looked down at Remus and Tonks, holding hands one last time in death, he was numb. 


 



Let me take your hand, I'll make it right



 


Harry raised his hand to hold Aunt Petunia's hand in the grocery store, there were so many people here, it was scary. He grasped her hand, only for her to yank her hand away and slap at it, before looking around anxiously to see if anyone saw. Seeing that no one saw, she gripped his shoulder painfully, and scolded him. 


 


Harry never tried to hold her hand again. 


 



I swear to love you with all my life



 


""I would love to!"" Harry said brightly, living with Sirius would be a dream! No more Dursely's, no more Harry Hunting, and a happy life with someone who actually cared about him, why would he dream of anything else?


 



Hold on, I still need you



 


He screamed as he watched Sirius fall through the veil. No, he still needed to fulfill the dream of living with Sirius! It isn't fair! Why can't he just be happy!


 



Long endless highway, you're silent beside me



 


Ron screamed as he drove the flying car above King's Cross, Harry gripped the door and seat, hanging on for dear life. 


 



Driving a nightmare I can't escape from



 


Harry shot up in bed, a scream on his lips as he saw Mr.Weasley get mauled by the snake, by him! Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Neveille were awake and were surrounding him, looks of concern on their faces. 


 


""Mr.Weasley! He, he,"" Harry couldn't speak, the words jumbling out in his panic, scar blazing. 


 



Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading



 


A piercing pain lanced through Harry's head as his small body was tossed into his cupboard, spots dancing across his vision. He sat there for hours before the tears fell. 


 


""I wish someone would take me away, to a place where I could be happy."" And Harry blew on the picture of a cake with lit candles, pretending to make a wish on them. 


 



Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones



 


He leaned on a tree in the freezing cold, the lake water doing him no favors. He struggled, trying to use the sword to break the ice, but it didn't work, he was going to drown! 


 



They took you away on a table



 


Harry felt the heavy steps of Hagrid as he carried him. The laughs of Death Eaters Around him, and eventually, the deranged laugh of Voldemort as he bragged to the Order. 


 



I pace back and forth as you lay still



 


Harry bit his lip nervously, he had detention with Snape. This time he actually deserved it, but he was nervous all the same. Snape had started looking at him weird, he never really caught it too often, but now he felt it burning on his back every once in awhile. Harry didn't understand why this was just now changing in 6th year, was it the Occlumency training? 


 



They pull you in to feel your heartbeat



 


He breathed hard as he hovered over Cedric's dead body, cheering echoing out around him. The words ""

kill the spare

"" repeated in his head as he looked at Cedric.



Hands pulled him away and he screamed, he promised Cedric his body would be safe, he had to make sure of it!


 



Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me



 


""Does it hurt? Dying?"" He asked, feeling childish. 


 


Sirius looked at him softly, the silence of the forest making his words seem more ominous then they needed to be. ""Faster than falling asleep."" 


 



Hold on, I still want you



 


He lit his wand up in remembrance for Dumbledore. The grief numbing yet becoming so much more fresh. 


 



Come back, I still want you



 


The cloth being floated to him, and he felt something in him try to leave. A bright light burst into sight and his vision went black, a scream piercing the train compartment.


 



Let me take your hand, I'll make it right



 


Blood poured out from Snape's neck as he tried to stop the bleeding. He was a spy! Harry needed more information, he needed to know how to fix everything! 


 



I swear to love you all my life



 


Harry smiled and started laughing as his friends laughed on the couch. He wasn't sure about what they were laughing about, but he felt warm. 


 



Hold on, I still need you



 


He watched as Remus walked out of his, now old, office. His things floating behind him. He had quit thanks to his werewolf status being leaked out. So much for the best DADA teacher he'd ever had. 


 



I don't wanna let go



 


Blinding white greeted him after he died from Voldemort. Was this truly it? Now that he was actually dead, Harry realized there were still things to do, things that he needed to do. 


 



I know I'm not that strong



 


""Is he dead?"" Harry asked Dumbledore. 


 


""Yes, Harry, he is dead."" Dumbledore admitted. ""Though if you ask me, he was already dead when he was possessed by Voldemort."" 






Harry sighed in relief, he wasn't a murderer. How could he, a scrawny, malnourished boy even kill a person? It was just inconceivable. 


 



I just wanna hear you 



 


He sat in his room, the padlocks only making it seem more oppressive. ""Sorry Hedwig,"" Harry whispered. ""I don't have anything to feed you right now, you'll have to wait until I can sneak some food up."" 


 



Saying, ""baby let's go home""



 


Harry pottered around, doing chores quickly in hopes that he could get praise from Aunt and Uncle. In record time, Harry had the house looking spotless, pride filling him, he had done this, surely now his Aunt and Uncle will be proud, give him a pat on the head. 


 


Finally, his Aunt and Uncle were home. ""Look at this house!"" Aunt cried, and Harry puffed up his chest. ""Its a mess! What would the neighbors think! Vernon, do something!"" 


 


That night, Harry went to bed in his cupboard, too sore to move, blood soaking his thin mattress, and his hope of receiving love from his Aunt and Uncle squashed.


 



Let's go home



 


He looked at his mum in the clearing, wishing that it was actually her and not just an apparition. Harry wished that he could go home with them all and live with them like he was supposed to. 


 



Yeah, I just wanna take you home



 


Silent tears slipped down Harry's face as he looked at all of the dead and injured in the destroyed dining hall. The pain and suffering shoving itself into his head, the screams, the grief, the guilt. 


 



Hold on, I still want you



 


""You have your mother's eyes."" Snape choked out, and Harry sent him a pained smile, until Snape's chest shuddered and fell still. Harry's smile slipped off, and he held the vial of tears in his hand, why wouldn't anyone stay?


 



Come back, I still need you



 


Harry coughed, blood splattering on the ground. Voldemort was dead, and it looked like Harry would join him. The last Death Eater standing had gotten him with a bad cutting hex to the torso, and Harry fell seemingly in slow motion as pain shot up his body. 


 


He lay on the ground, hearing the footsteps of his friends, the cries of his name. Harry blinked and their faces were above him, looking scared and full of grief. 


 


The pain seemed to fade away, like he knew he was. Pulling up his last vestige of strength, Harry smiles at his friends. ""You guys don't need me anymore, smile for me, yeah?"" 


 


It was with dim recognition that they agreed, and before his vision fades, he sees them crying, some of them hugging. And everything goes to black, his chest coming to a wheezy stop.


Lily Potter



Take me to the rooftop



 


Lily laughed, bright lights surrounded her tiny toddler body. She reaaallllyyy wanted to see fireworks like what Petunia had told her about from school. The small exploding lights lit up the living room with dazzling colors. Mum and Dad looked at them in wonder, Petunia was in her room, but when she came out, she also saw the display.


 



I wanna see the world when I stop breathing



 


""Take Harry and run! Go!"" James cried, urging them forward. 


 


Lily grabbed Harry and ran up to the nursery, and slammed the lock shut. Not her Harry, anything but her Harry.


 



Turning blue



 


She gasped as water was thrown at her head. ""Sev! No fair!"" Lily shrieked joyously, sending water right back at him. Peals of laughter echoed through the clearing.


 



Tell me, love is endless, don't be so pretentious



 


""Lily Evans, please be my girlfriend!"" Idiot Potter said, standing on a table. Lily stood and waved her wand, casting a spell to change his hair color to pink and another silent one to tie his shoes together. 


 


""No.""


 



Leave me, like you do(like you do)



 


Tears streamed down her face as she ran from Severus. He had called her a mudblood. How could Severus do that? It just wasn't like him.


 



If you need me



 


Lily tapped the clean quill onto the piece of parchment, one hand on her swollen belly. She shook her head and re-read the letter, but shook her head, throwing it in the fire, and she watched it burn. She could never manage to send a letter to Sev. 


 



Wanna see me



 


Harry looked up at Lily, wet and face red from crying. Her baby boy, finally out into the world. Love filled Lily, she would treasure the sight of her baby boy for as long as she lived.


 



Better hurry



 


""You have to go into hiding my dear girl, Voldemort is coming after your family"" Dumbledore told Lily, a sad twinkle in his eyes. 


 



'Cause I'm leaving soon



 


Lily ran through the forest, chasing some Death Eaters, and fired off curses at them. She knocked a mask off one of them and her eyes widened. 


 


""Sev?""


 


Severus looked at her, his face the picture of guilt and fear. Lily stood there, the other Death Eaters having escaped. ""Go, Severus. Just......just go.""


 



Sorry, can't save me now



 


""Lily! I'm sorry, I didn't-""


 


""Oh so you didn't mean to call me mudblood several days ago!"" She shot back at him, betrayed. ""If you didn't mean it, Why'd you say it !"" Her lip trembled and tears welled up. ""I thought we were friends Sev, but friends don't say stuff like that to each other.""


 



Sorry, I don't know how



 


A flower grew from Lily's palm, its white petals looking delicate. 


 


""Freak!"" Petunia cried at her, slapping the flower away and crushing it, and then ran away.


 


A boy recessed in black came out from behind the tree. ""You're not a freak."" Lily spun around to face him, looking curious. ""It's magic, its perfectly natural. I'm Severus.""


 


""Lily.""


 



Sorry, there's no way out(sorry)



 


The door banged open to reveal Voldemort, and Lily felt afraid. 


 



But down, mm down



 


She dived into the cool waters of the lake, the water surrounding her body like a cool pillow, muffling everything including her own thoughts. 


 



Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek



 


Lily cried as James kissed her in the alleyway, she didn't want to, but she had to for the good of the Order. Dumbledore said so, and her heart hurt still from Severus's betrayal to her, she needed something to distract her. 


 



That's what a year-long headache does to you



 


Her head fell onto her Charms notes, N.E.W.T. 's really were no joke. 


 



I'm not ok, I feel so scattered



 


The fire crackled in the fireplace, and the chill of the snowy air leaked inside from the open window. Everything was filled with noise, yet her head was silent. Lily's mind floated around everywhere like it was in water. 


 



Don't say I'm all that matters



 


Lily huffed at those stupid Marauder boys, and turned to Severus. ""Are you ok Severus?"" She offered her hand to him. 


 



Leave me



 


""Go away Black, I don't care."" Black laughed and saddled up beside Lily, starting to say something again.""If you don't back off I'll neuter you right here, right now."" Lily's eyes glowed a dangerous green, and Black backed off. 


 



Deja vu



 


Lily walked into the meeting room for the Order, and her eyes widened. Severus was at the meeting, he looked skinnier than before, yet still filled out. He looked more handsome then she remembered, and their eyes met. His eyes pierced her own, before looking away at the table. 


 



If you need me



 


The newly wed Longbottom's gave hugs all around, laughter filling the reception place. Lily smiled at them, they deserved happiness. 


 



Wanna see me



 


She looked in the mirror, turning to look at her side view, an anxious look on her face. Was she gaining weight?


 



You better hurry



 


Severus laid on the grass next to her. They were silent, but that was alright with Lily, they had the spotted sky to keep them company, so no words were needed.


 



I'm leaving soon



 


The white dress hugged Lily's torso, accentuating her curves. She didn't know if she really wanted to marry James, she didn't even think that she actually loved him. 


 


She shook the thoughts from her mind, it was for the greater god, Dumbledore said so.


 



Sorry, can't save me now



 


""Not Harry, please not my Harry!"" Lily cried, tears streaming down her face.


 


""Move you stupid girl!""


 



Sorry, I don't know how(sorry)



 


Lily pressed a hand against her mouth in fear. She couldn't help Sev without making it worse. 


 


""Stupid freak boy! What have I told you about using your fucking 

magic

!"" His father yelled, words slurring. 


 



Sorry, there's no way out(sorry)



 


She held a finger over her mouth, telling Sev to be quiet. Madam Pince was starting to approach their corner, they couldn't let her know they were staying overnight with the books so they could create new potions! 


 



But down, mm down



 


""

Avada Kedavra

!"" Voldemort cried. Lily jumped in front of Harry, screaming. Her body flew through the air faster than she thought possible.


 



Call my friends and tell them that I love them



 


Smiling, Lily signed off the letter to Frank, Alice was expecting just like she was and it was such wonderful news.


 



And I'll miss them



 


Wands were lit in the air as they buried bodies of friends, true warriors against the dark. Silent tears slipped down Lily's cheeks. 


 



But I'm not I'm sorry



 


One last letter was signed off, left in the official will, just in case. It was to Severus, she had always been unable to stay mad at him, but he had gotten tangled up in the dark, despite now being a spy. Lily didn't think they were going to last till Christmas, and she left the letter in the vault with the rest of the letters. 


 



Call my friends and tell them, that I love them



 


Lily found Severus's journal, and read some of the entries, some making her blush. A smile spread across her face and her stomach fluttered in joy, but she put it back right where she found it, and never said a word. 


 



And I'll miss them



 


She pressed a kiss onto Harry's head, her baby boy, already taking his first steps. She wanted to watch him grow up and grow old. 


 



Sorry



 


The spell hit her and her world went black, the last thing she knew was screaming.

Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter.




The sound of rainwater falling and the smell of petrichor surrounded him. It was chilly,  yet he felt nothing as he walked around barefooted. Of course it was chilly,  it was the last of August after all, and the autumnal season had just begun. Walking around the grounds of the castle he once called his home, Harry Potter couldn't help but wonder how things had turned into the state they are now. 



Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter. 



What state did he mean exactly? Harry didn't even know.  Did he mean himself? The apathy? Or was it alexithymia? He thought it was possibly just numbness or disconnection. It was just after the war after all, and it was completely understandable why he was so...monotone. 



But 15 years had passed since then and he was 

still 

feeling the same. Fifteen years after the war, 32 year-old Harry James Potter was feeling the same numbness. 



Was it numbness? Alexithymia? Possibly apathy? No, definitely apathy.



Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter. 



Hadn't he asked himself this already? 



Harry didn't know. He didn't particularly care either. 



No, Harry James Potter didn't care. Or was it the lack of feeling the need to care? Anyway, he preferred this. The peace that comes with the lack of emotions. 



Pitter-patter, Pitter-patter, whoosh, pitter-patter,  whoosh



Was it peace? Harry tilted his head as he pondered on the question. The rain was still falling around him, but instead of the heavy downpour, it was now a soft trickling.  There were no students yet, and the teachers hadn't noticed that he was in the castle. Well, of course they wouldn't. They were down in Hogsmeade. 



The winter wind had preceded the clouds that brought the snow in the Scottish Highlands. Did he shiver?If he did, he didn't notice. Peace. Harry had remembered wishing for it when he was a boy, but the reason, he couldn't exactly recall. Was this peace? Living with apathy? It probably was not the same peace his younger self had hoped for, but Harry thought that it didn't matter. No one bothered him anymore, and he's more than happy to accept that. 



Drip, drop, whoosh, drip, drop, whoosh.



The rainfall had slowed even more, and the wind picked up more. He continued to walk around, ignoring the slow build of mud on his feet. 



Clip, clop, clip, clop. 



The sound of hooves caught his attention, and Harry recognised the blond hair of his only centaur friend, Firenze. 



""Hello, Mr. Potter."" 



""Hello, Firenze. How may I help you?"" 



""Oh, no. I'm merely here to say goodbye."" 



Harry blinked, and Firenze saw how the once bright green eyes had lost its spark. 



""Ah, so you know. How, if you don't mind me asking?"" 



""The stars had slightly lost the glow that it received when you were born."" 



Harry merely nodded, and bowed his head in thanks to Firenze before walking away slowly. Firenze bowed behind him, not that Harry saw it, and left, his heart silently breaking for the only male human his tribe has accepted. 



Drip, drop, drip, whoosh, rustle. 



Taking a deep breath, the scent of petrichor was surrounding him, filling his lungs. 



As he walked closer towards the middle of the forest, Harry smiled softly. His end was coming. As if hearing his thoughts, his sole house elf, an old little thing named Koby, popped into his visual range. 



And Koby truly was an old thing. At the age of 200, the only thing keeping him alive was Harry's magic. Harry smiled at the small thing, a smile that looked fond. Was he fond? Maybe. 



If it was, maybe Harry wasn't so apathetic after all.



""Master Harry?"" 



""Hello, Koby. Are you sure you do not wish to bond with another family?"" 



""No, Master Harry. I is very olds, and I wishes to be with my mate."" Koby said, bowing at Harry, his long, floppy ears reaching the ground and scraping the mud. 



""Very well. Please stay in Gringotts. And do send my thanks and final regards to Ragnok."" Harry said, petting the small grey tuft of hair on top of Koby's head. 



With a pop, Koby disappeared and reappeared within the halls of Gringotts, where all house elves waited for their end. 



Ragnok just bowed solemnly. Harry had been the only human that had shown the goblin horde the respect that the Wizarding world had not given them. 



Drip, drop, whoosh, drip, drop.



The middle of the forest was a clearing, with a soft bed of flowers at the very centre. 



Lilies, how fitting. 



Taking out his wand, Harry laid on the bed of lilies and took his wand out and pointed it to himself.



A deep breath, a flick of the wand, and a murmur of his words, Harry James Potter spoke his last words. 



""

Avada Kedavra.

"" 



Harry knew no more, and Koby softly closed his eyes as the magic finally left him.

""What do you want, Sirius?""

""Will you take Harry for me? I want to go to the pub with Sara.""

Remus looks at me questioningly. ""I thought you hated Sara after what she did to you in school.""

I roll my eyes. ""Yeah, well. Things change.""

Remus huffs. ""Fine. I suppose I can take the Prongslet while you go on a date.""

""It's not a date, Moony and you know it.""

""Yeah whatever, Padfoot. You're going on dates every week!""

I roll my eyes again, ""She's married.""

Remus looked embarrassed and I silently laugh.

""Oh,"" he said, ""Well have fun.""

I lean over and hand Harry to him, ""Tag, your it.""

... 15 years later... 

""Nice one James!""

Harry looks at me oddly while the curses fly and I realize my mistake. However I don't say anything. There are more important things to deal with.

I also notice that Lucius is an exceptional dueler.

There is a break in the spells so I turn to Harry. I'm hoping to apologize for calling him James. But I am too late.

I don't even notice the spell speed toward me.

It hits me full in the chest. Cast by my own cousin.

I can feel myself drifting away. Floating away. Flying away.

I see James on the other side, and Lily. They're waiting for me. But there is one more thing I have to be sure of.

As I fall back to the twisted archway I look at my little Prongslet. He is watching with his face twisted with rage and sorrow.

'Don't cry.' I think. 'I'll be okay.'

My dear Moony is the last thing I see. He holds onto Harry. Hugging him so he wouldn't break to pieces. I look into those beautiful eyes and say silently, 

'Tag, your it.'

""George honey, can you take that rubbish down to the third floor corridor? Minerva is doing all the vanishing down there.""

I looked around. A giant pile of rubble lay at the foot of the stairs. The Great Hall was still a mess from two nights earlier. We all tried to block out the pain of the battle by rebuilding Hogwarts.

I had cried my eyes dry over *him*. I knew that in years to come, I would still be waiting for *him* to finish my sentences. 

I walked over to the looming pile. It was a little bigger than I expected, but I always liked a little challenge.

""Wingardium Leviosa."" I whispered.

Most of the rubble lifts up. I'll have to come back with the rest later.

I walk awkwardly to the third floor. Straining my wand to maneuver the hovering mass down stairs and up corridors.

I finally made it there. (Without any casualties) Minerva is standing by the wall vanishing another pile of rubbish. I walk up to her and put down the pile.

I know that she is going to want to offer sympathy. But that is the *last* thing I need right now.

Before she can even thank me, I run off to the Great Hall. At some point I must have made a wrong turn because I end up in front of an unfamiliar door.

I turn around to head back, but something in that room tells me to go in. I'm on the second floor so it can't be the Room of Requirement. I needed some adventure, and this room was the perfect opportunity. It was dark and mysterious and I was feeling a little reckless.

Thinking (somewhat sarcastically) 'what could possibly go wrong?' I step into the room.

It seems empty at first. But there is a mirror on the far wall.

I had avoided looking into mirrors since the battle. Because every time I look it reminds me of him.

But I am curious and all walk over. It's huge. Ceiling to floor length. It looks like an ordinary mirror. I read the inscription on the top:

'erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi'

I can't believe it. I've heard about this mirror. But it was supposedly destroyed. Everyone thought it was destroyed in my third year. How is it possible? It shouldn't be possible. But here I am. 

Standing next to the Mirror of Erised.

I know what it does. I'm not stupid. I also know that I should not look into it. But I do.

I look in and I see myself. Just myself. I let out a sigh of relief. It must be a replica of the real Mirror. The real Mirror probably was destroyed.

I sigh and walk out the door.

What I didn't realize was that the boy in the Mirror was standing slightly different from me.

He had the tiniest of smiles, where I usually wore a scowl.

He also had both ears, where I only had one.

The boy in the Mirror was my brother.

I watch them step into the compartment. They're all so young. Especially Harry. The Prongslet looks so much like James. But his eyes. He has Lily's eyes.

Oh, here I go again. Making things all sentimental.

""Who's that?"" The redhead asks. I assume he is referring to me, as I am the only other person in this compartment.

I snap my eyes shut. No need for them to know that I'm awake. My job here is to protect the students. I would be better off doing it under cover.

The brunette is the first to answer, ""Professor R. J. Lupin.""

The redhead turns to Harry, ""She knows everything that one.""

""Honestly Ronald! It's on his briefcase.""

So the redhead's a Weasley. Should have known.

All seems safe for now so I let myself drift off for a little while. I dream uneasily. I have had little rest since... 

I am awoken by the trio talking about my dear old friend Padfoot.

""Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?""

""Yeah.""

""But they'll catch black won't they? I mean everyone's looking for him.""

""Sure Hermione. Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before. And he's a murdering ravenous lunatic.""

""Thanks Ron.""

A murdering ravenous lunatic? Well... 

Suddenly the train jitters to a halt. I keep my eyes shut tight, but a hand closes on my wand under my tattered robe.

""Why are we stopping?"" The brunette- Hermione sounds panicked. ""We can't be there yet.""

The Prongslet gets up.

""What's going on?"" Ron is thrown back in his seat.

""Dunno. Maybe we've broken down.""

The lights go out.

I clutch my wand tighter.

""Ouch Ron, that was my foot.""

""There's something moving out there.""

Moving?

""Something's coming towards us..."" Ron's voice is barely more than a whisper.

The air starts to get cold. A shiver runs down my spine. I know what's coming.

I open my eyes to peek. The window starts to freeze over, and my bottle of water turns to ice in mere moments.

The train jolts.

""Bloody hell! What's happening!?""

Then I see it. Black and hooded. The air gets colder still. It creeps steadily closer.

It wraps it's bony fingers around the half open compartment door. They're not really bony, just straight bones.

It opens the door and slowly glides into the compartment. It's presence is like a black hole. It sucks all of the happiness from the room. The bad memories start in my head. But I can't imagine what it must be like for Harry.

A cat hisses, and the rat scurries under the seat.

The Dementor approaches my Prongslet; he has the worst memories of all of us. If I don't act soon, he'll be given the Kiss.

I summon happy memories of James, Sirius and Peter. My eyes blink open and I stand up, the clock falling off.

*Expecto Patronum.*

A silvery shield erupts from the end of my wand. It hasn't taken form, my memory isn't happy enough.

It's only one Dementor so the shield will do.

The Dementor flees, and Harry collapses.

Hermione screams. She rushes over to Harry. Ron close behind.

""Harry! Harry! Are you alright!"" She gasps.

Harry blinks open his eyes that look so much like Lily's. Hermione hands him his glasses.

""Thank you.""

I pull a piece of my favorite treat from my pocket.

""Here eat this. It'll help.""

The Prongslet looks at me like I'm crazy. A look that James gave me all the time.

I roll my eyes, ""It's alright,"" I say, ""It's chocolate.""

He tentatively takes it from my hand. I smile at him. Although he has no idea who I am, I know all about him.

""What- what was that thing?"" He asks.

""It was a Dementor."" I answer, ""One of the guards of Azkaban. But it's gone now. I assume it was searching the train for Sirius Black.""

All three of them look terrified.

I gulp. ""If you'll excuse me. I need to have a little word with the driver.""

I stand up.

I open the compartment door. But before I leave I say stupidly, ""Eat. You'll feel better.""

As I walk down the train I can't help but think.

What would it have been like if Lily and James were still alive?

Was it actually Sirius that had sold them out?

I have a feeling that there is more to the story than meets the eye. And I'm usually right about these things.

What will Harry think of me after he finds out my secret?

If Lily and James were still alive. I would be going over for dinner every Sunday night. The Prongslet would probably call me Uncle Remus.

Things would be so different than it was now if it weren't for Sirius.

The saddest part is: I will never know Harry like I thought I would. I know him like a son. He knows me like a stranger.

My little Prongslet will remain a mystery to me. I can only hope to protect him as much as possible."

It was a windy and quiet night. Louis just sits up there on the edge of the astronomy tower. It was a beautiful night. Bright stars glittering the dark sky making him feel like everything was okay. But it wasn't okay

Numb

He felt numb


""You promised! You fucking promised Tomlinson!""


""I didn't mean to"" Louis whispers as he stares at the wand in his hand laughing bitterly. ""I didn't want to"" he says softly. His blue eyes moving down on his left inner forearm. There sits the dark mark, taunting him, reminding him that his life will forever be ruined by the stupid mark. Why did his father even allow the dark lord to give him this?

A mark that he didn't even want to take.

And a task that he doesn't even want to complete.

Oh yeah because his father is a complete coward


""Kill the mud-blood and the blood traitor. While you're at it kill the headmaster as well without them Harry would be weak-""


""Louis"" He hears someone call his name making him wipe his tears, he puts on a fake smile and turns around to face the intruder. ""Oh Harry it's just you"" Louis signals him to go sit next to him but Harry doesn't move. ""Go on Harry, we need to talk"" he says scooting to the side a bit so that the younger lad would have more space to sit.

""I heard you... you know... how you didn't want it""

Louis doesn't reply and continues staring at the night sky.

""It's just-"" Harry stops himself finding the right words to say. ""Why didn't you tell me before? I could've helped""

Louis laughs shaking his head. ""You Gryffindors and your stupid hero complex"" he turns his head to face Harry once more. ""You know just because you are the chosen one doesn't mean you are invincible. I would very much want to keep you alive before you're battle with the dark lord. No need to risk your life just for me to not get the dark mark""

""But Louis"" Harry argues and stands up ""It is a big deal, how am I sure that you're not actually being used to bring me to Voldemort? How am I sure that you are going to be completely safe and that you won't be receiving the Cruciatus curse every five minutes. How-""

""You won't be sure"" Louis cuts him off ""You're not even sure if you could trust me anymore"" The now death eater holds his wand tightly and closes his eyes and inhales sharply while standing up.

""And that's why I need to do this. For your own safety"" he says opening his eyes as he lifts his wand up pointing it to Harry making the younger lad's eyes widen in shock. ""I'm sorry Harry, Oblivi-""

""Expeliarmus!"" Harry shouted immediately, his wand pointing at Louis now too. ""What on earth was that?! What we're you thinking?"" Louis' eyes widen as he sees his wand fall behind Harry so far from his reach. He starts crying knowing that Harry already knows what he wanted to do. His plan was ruined.

Harry pulls Louis to the floor hugging him and crying as well dropping his own wand beside them. ""Don't do that, please. I can't lose those memories, I can't lose you""

""Please Harry you have to understand. What if he reads your mind? He'll know that you care for me and knowing him he'll probably torture me in front of you and vise versa. I can't risk him hurting you Harry, not if I can prevent it. Please just let me do this""

""N-no there has to be another way. Please, we could go back to pretending to be enemies and he wouldn't suspect a thing. Just don't get rid of them."" Harry begs desperately

The death eater sees how close his wand was now and he could feel the chosen one freezing. Noticing that Louis could take his wand now and do the exact thing he asks him not to.

""Louis don't"" he whispers but the Slytherin already made up his mind and takes the wand back into his hand. ""I'll give them back after the battle"" Louis compromises. Harry lets go of the hug, already accepting that he lost, and moves back so he could look at those mesmerizing blue eyes and kisses his boyfriend for the last time.

They savor their last moment together and Louis once again points his wand to the younger lad. But before he casts his spell he whispers a soft 'I love you' and he receives one back. He lets out a choked sob as he finally performs the spell uninterrupted.

Harry just sits there smiling bitterly, knowing that there's no use in fighting it. He whispers a last I love you before he passes out.

Louis continues performing another spell crying, the false memory charm. Replacing all his and Harry's happy memories into their usual fights in the school corridor. Once he was finished he fell to his knees in exhaustion and just as he did that he sees Harry start gaining consciousness. He wipes his face to get rid of the tears and pretended that he fell down after Harry pushed him in one of their fights.

Harry groans from the headache while sitting up he sees Tomlinson on the floor, right beside him, looking out of breath.

""What the actual fuck happened Tomlinson? Why does my head hurt? What did you do?"" Harry asks in a pissed tone glaring at the Slytherin.

""Bold of you to accuse me of doing such thing to you Styles"" Louis spat converting all his sadness into fake anger. ""Couldn't you see which of us is on the floor right now?""

""Shut the fuck up smart ass. Acting as if you're so clever- Wait were you crying?""

Louis stops and hesitates. Even if the Gryffindor lost his memories he could still read the Slytherin so well. Even with this fake facade going on. ""C-could once in your life mind your own business Styles? I don't really want you here gracing me with your presence.""

""You git I was trying to be nice""

""Oh congratulations what do you want a cookie?!"" Louis shouts at him sarcastically. He is just tired of this. He wants to go back to his dorm where he could break down in peace. ""Just leave me alone you prat"" he says lowering down his voice. This time Harry listens and started walking down the stairs.

""I love you, I'm so sorry maybe I'll give those memories back after the war but not now... not now"" Harry hears Tomlinson's whisper. He looks back, seeing Tomlinson gazing at the stars. Was he talking to him? Is that why his head hurts? But Tomlinson loving him out of all people? 

Nahh it seems impossible.

He doesn't think anything ever will.

Long ago, he summed his backwards life as such: Remus has things Lily does not.

Isn't that how it always starts out? Thinking that rationalizing is the way to go? Remus might've always been the smartest of the four of them, the Marauders, but James wasn't that far behind. He was a lot sharper than they gave him credit for.

It was how he thought he could reason Remus away...though Remus keeps coming back, because the one thing James isn't strong enough to do is permanently send him away.

Even now, as James lies awake in the crystal clear clarity of the early morning, he sees pink skin, slender curves, flaming red hair, and the same color eyelashes hiding emerald gems for eyes...and his mind throws back to last night's...

...white skin, softened edges marred by scars, lanky brown hair, and the same color eyelashes hiding molten globes of sepia for eyes. The same eyelashes that flutter open and allow those brown eyes to rest on him as the broken smile on that face smiles--just for him.

So what does it mean? James loves a nice, tight...box, but occasionally prefers a nice, tight...arse? Or does he have a thing for cocks versus pussies? If that were the truth, then would he really have a kid with Lily?

At some point, James told himself, Lily doesn't have a rod. That's that. So Remus became a plaything.

But that wasn't right either. It wasn't right to Remus; hell, it wasn't even right to Lily. Lily had his love; Remus had his passion...but James knew that wasn't it. It couldn't be it, because if that were the case, then why did Lily get the wan grins and Remus, the cuddling after a bout of lovemaking?

There used to be lines when James could distinguish Lily as his love and Remus as his lover, but what does James do now that one of them is both?

He's sickened with himself for playing them...so he knows something's got to end. So...he'll do it.

He'll do it tonight. He knows he and Lily are in hiding, and this is just another case of ""James Potter's Worst Timing Ever,"" but it shouldn't be too bad, telling Remus that he's picked...he's picked him over his family. After all, it's just another night in hiding.

What's the worst that could happen?"

""Are you serious?"" Asked Harry.

 

""Of course, my boy."" Albus replied. ""I have it all worked out.""

 

""No. I am done. The old wanker is dead. This marriage contract will not work for me.""

 

""I am your magical guardian. I have written this for you. This is for the greater good my boy.""

 

Harry scoffed. ""Who's greater good? And you are not my magical guardian.""

 

""Of course I am. I have been since you were one. It will all work out my boy.""

 

""I am not your boy. You are not my magical guardian. Try again.""

 

""What are you talking about my- Harry,"" Albus said gruffly.

 

""Well, you are not my magical guardian because I have claimed my seats and Lordships.""

 

""Well, I wrote this before you did that."" Why did he do that? I have to fix this.


 


""It still won't work. You have not been my magical guardian for a while. So, that marriage contract is illegal. Besides Severus would never agree.""

 

""I will take of Severus, but what do you mean about me not being your magical guardian for a while.""

 

""That is actually yours and the ministry's fault. By proclaiming me a fourth champion in the tournament, for only of age students, you effectively emancipated me, which helped me a lot.""

 

""WHAT?!! That cannot be true! I have to be in charge! I have to control the Wizengamot through your contract by using Severus!"" Albus screamed.

 

Harry was taken back. ""Well thank you for telling me your plans. If that is all Headmaster, I will take my leave now."" Harry swept from the office, leaving a flabbergasted Dumbledore behind.

 

He walked down to the dungeons and relayed the conversation he just had with Dumbledore to Severus.

 

""Severus don't worry. I will talk to Kingsley and Amelia. He will not be able to force you to do anything,"" Harry promised.

 

""Thank you, Harry. That helps. He used to hold Azkaban over my head to get me to comply with something I did not want to do or did not necessarily like. I hope this puts an end to his manipulations and stops him in his tracks.""

 

""Oh it will. I got it,"" Harry vowed.

 

After leaving Severus, Harry fire called Kingsley and told him what happened inside the Headmaster's office as well.

 

""I just can't believe how manipulative that man can be. Just to stay in power. I believed in him,"" Kingsley said.

 

""I know. I didn't want to believe it either. I am pretty sure now looking back at it, that he wanted me to die so that he could keep control of the Wizengamot. Now that you know, you will be able to stop any arrest warrants going out for Severus or him trying to manipulate the press or something else. This is just in case. I will be able to call on magic to judge any contracts if he tries to force it though.""

 

""Anything I can do for you Harry, of course I will do it. Severus did his time and has paid back everything and more towards the good cause to end this war. He deserves to live his life how he wants and so do you. I will help you any way I can. I will even back you up if it comes down to it,"" Kingsley promised.

 

Later that night Harry was relaxing with his boyfriend re-telling him everything that transpired. He did not need rumors or Dumbledore trying to break them up because he was keeping secrets from him.

 

""Babe, it's not your fault. I understand. He is still trying to manipulate and use you. I will not let that happen. I love you. I will not let anyone get in between us and our future together.""

 

""Thanks. I love you too. I needed to hear that."" Harry murmured into his skin, holding him tight against him.

 

When Albus did try the marriage contract, Harry called for it to be judged by magic and it came back illegal. It forced Dumbledore to lose all of his titles and accolades. People started doubting him and not listening to him. Harry had the whole Magical community behind him. Harry was so glad he had the Goblins help him after the travesty of fourth year. Eventually Dumbledore was the pariah of the whole Wizarding World. Harry went on to get his Master's in Defense, Charms, and Dueling. He even married his boyfriend, Draco Malfoy and Severus was kept safe from Azkaban, even going on to marry his own lover, Remus Lupin.

He was thankful he was no longer at the Dursley's. They would have beaten him over that one. His racing heart finally calmed down, and his harsh breathing slowed down. He had known he might get  a power boost turning 17, but no one mentioned how much pain he would be in. His stomach cramped and he doubled over the side of the bed, vomiting. He took his wand and cleaned up the sick. He got up and walked down the hallway of Grimauld place to the bathroom. When he got there he was shocked by what he saw in the mirror. His eyes were no longer green, they were lavender purple; his hair was no longer curly and short, it was long and silky straight; and he had long pointy ears.

""What the hell?"" He whispered to himself. ""What is going on?""

He quickly glamoured himself and went to the library. He didn't want anyone else (mostly Hermione) to know before he knew himself what was actually going on. He searched the library for books on creature inheritances and creature rights. He also tried looking for a Potter lineage book as well. He found what he was looking for.


Elves-



Pointy ears, lavender eyes, affinity for nature elements, proficient in Charms, DADA, and Herbology. Male submissive elves will gain the ability to bear children, most will have stomach cramping the day their inheritance sets in. All elves have a predestined mate. Elves will know their mate by smell and magic sensitivity. Elf mates can be any sort of creature or even just a plain wizard. Submissive elves have to be especially careful, if their mate rejects them, they will have 72 hours left to live. Alphas are much rarer and tend to be weaker than submissives. 


Harry put the book down, so he was an elf, and a submissive one at that. Huh. Well, he would have to tell his friends and the Headmaster eventually. He read up on creature rights, and it said that no matter who his mate was, he would legally be able to be with them and nothing could come between them especially if they were mated. Harry was relieved at that.

He went down to the kitchen and prepared breakfast for himself and those in his house. The Weasleys trickled in along with the Headmaster.

""I thought you should know, that not only did get a power boost last night, but I gained a creature inheritance."" Harry told them all when they sat at the table.

""Are you sure, my boy? You don't look any different."" The headmaster stated.

""Yes I am quite sure."" He dropped his glamour. A gasp went through the room.

""You're an elf!"" Hermione exclaimed.

""Yes I am. Are you okay with this?""

""Sure mate, you can't change who you are."" Ron said.

Harry smiled. ""Thanks Ron.""

""Of course it doesn't bother me. I wonder where it comes from?"" Hermione asked.

Harry laughed. ""Apparently, my great great grandfather married an elf and had children with her and it for some reason did not show up in my father, but showed up in me.""

Hermione nodded.

""You will tell me if you sense who your mate is."" The Headmaster demanded.

Harry frowned. He didn't understand why the Headmaster needed to know, but he agreed anyway.

Harry spent the rest of the summer studying and learning more about his heritage as well as trying to study for his last year and NEWTS. He knew he had a lot on his plate this year. Not only did he want to find his mate, but he wanted to get rid of Voldy and just be Harry for once.

On the train, he was disappointed in not finding his mate there. He hoped that maybe he missed them and would find them at Hogwarts. He really didn't know where else they might be.

Once at Hogwarts he felt more at home and peace. He froze when he sensed and smelled his mate. His mate smelled of spices, coffee, and earth. Harry searched the sea of students for his mate, but they were not there. Harry nervously focused on the staff table finding his mate there. 'Oh no'. He thought miserably. His mate was none other than Severus Snape, the one person who hated him more than anything. He was doomed. He felt numb. He mindlessly kept moving at sat heavily at the Gryffindor table waiting for the sorting to begin. His friends worriedly looked at him, but he brushed them off and said he would tell them later.

That night he told his friends that he just felt his mate and that said mate hated him, they supported him no matter what, which he was thankful for. He was lucky he had such great friends. At first he thought they might yell or be angry, but they knew it didn't matter who harry's mate was, they wanted him to be happy. Now he just needed to somehow attempt to woo his mate before being rejected and then deal with Voldy.

In the morning, Headmaster Dumbledore called him up to his office.

""You wanted to see me sir?"" He said after knocking.

""Ah. My dear boy. Yes I did. I was wondering if you knew who your mate was yet.""

""I do.""

""Well then, who is it?""

Harry frowned. ""It's Professor Snape.""

""Oh that is wonderful. I can help you and make it so that you are together more and organize it so that you get time to get to know each other better.""

Harry was confused. ""That's alright Headmaster. I would rather try on my own thanks. Please don't tell him, I would like to be able to do that myself.""

""Of course my dear boy. Of course. Well if you need any help, I am willing to help. Don't forget Voldemort is still out there, so be careful.""

Harry didn't understand what was going on with the Headmaster. There was something off about the way he sounded. He pushed the thought away and nodded and left. He went down to breakfast and tried to focus on the conversations around him. His mind kept going back to the conversation he had with the Headmaster. He was confused and annoyed by it. It seemed wrong somehow. Harry didn't know why, but he felt like Dumbledore was trying to manipulate him. He got this feeling that Dumbledore was angry with Harry. He didn't understand why.

A few weeks later he received a missive from Gringotts. He was surprised because he had never received mail from them before. His curiosity peaked, he made to see the Goblins that weekend, as being 17 and having an apparition license, he could go off campus.

The week dragged on, and he was no closer to wooing Severus than before. His mate was just as surly as before. His mate hated him just as much as he used to. It was devastating. His elf cried out at night when he went to bed.

That weekend when he went to Gringotts he got the shock of a lifetime.

""You mean to say that, Albus Dumbledore has stolen from me and that he has manipulated me with magic to control me and my seats?"" Harry growled.

""Yes, Mr. Potter. We are very sorry. We will help retrieve all that has been stolen from you. You can even press charges against him, including not following your Parent's wills, and leaving you to those disgusting muggles.""

Harry growled. ""What else has he lied about?""

""The prophecy has been fulfilled. You no longer have to fight, if you don't want to. Gringotts was notified when the prophecy was fulfilled. He has also used your seats to get rid of wizarding culture, lessen the restrictions between the muggle and wizarding worlds, and tightened laws against creatures. Voldemort wants to reinstate these traditions, have tighter restrictions on muggles, and get rid of laws against creatures.""

""What?!!??!"" Harry cried.

""It's true. He has manipulated the whole of the Wizarding World. Making them think Voldemort is the evil one, when it's really Dumbledore.""

""What about the muggle killing and my parents?""

""Mostly it's Dumbledore's fault. He manipulated Voldemort and also has used fake Death Eaters to kill muggles as a way to encourage his view of things.""

Harry could hardly believe his ears. His world turned upside down. How was this possible? Why was Dumbledore doing this?

""What do I do?"" He whispered.

""Start with charging Dumbledore, we will send everything to the DMLE, they will start an investigation. Get people to listen to you and talk with Voldemort."" The Goblin said.

Harry agreed. He went back to Hogwarts, his head swimming with information. He got the DA together and showed them his proof of Dumbledore's manipulations. They were shocked to say the least. They couldn't believe that their beloved Headmaster would do something so evil. It was hard to grasp. Harry understood. He couldn't quite wrap his head around it either.

Harry tried to seek his mate out, but kept being rebuffed at every turn. He eventually went to Draco, whom he had become friends with, and tried to find a way into Severus' heart that way.

""Why don't you write him letters or ask for extra help?"" Draco suggested.

Harry considered those options, but didn't want Severus to burn his letters or just see him as a student. It was a double edged sword.

Meanwhile, Albus was dealing with being investigated for theft, line theft, child abuse, and child endangerment, as well as being reamed in the paper for the mistreatment of Harry Potter. That brat was going to pay. He laughed evilly as he called Severus up to his office and made sure Harry would be outside the office to 'overhear' said conversation.

Harry wandered the castle and found himself outside the Headmaster's office. That was strange. He didn't mean to end up here. Then he heard Severus' voice and froze. He wanted to know what that old coot was up to.

""You wanted see me Headmaster?'

""Yes I did my dear boy.""

""What is it? I am very busy.""

""I wondered how Mr. Potter was doing in your class? And I wanted to know if he has come to see you about anything?""

""Potter is dismal at Potions, he lacks the fine art of patience and attention of potion making. He is barely passing. He has not come to me? Why would he?""

""Oh dear. I had hoped that he would get better at Potions. You know it's his dream to become an Auror.""

""Albus I do not care.""

""I also was curious that he hasn't come to you because of his creature status.""

""Albus what are you on about? Potter isn't a creature.""

""Yes he is and you are his mate.""

""No. Absolutely not. I would not and could never be with him. I would rather date the wolf or mutt and you know how much I hate them.""

Harry hid a gasp. He felt his creature bond snap. 'Oh god.' That was what heartbreak felt like. It hurt. Harry quietly moved away from the Headmaster's rooms and wandered aimlessly. He knew his creature was going to die now. He had nothing left.

He went and found Draco. ""Take me to Him.""

Draco looked at him concerned. He shrugged. Knowing that Voldemort wouldn't harm him now that he knew the truth. He led Harry to the floo, and grabbed some floo powder, and yelled out ""Malfoy Manor"" as his and Harry's destination.

Draco calmly walked him into the office where Voldemort was going over plans. He looked up shocked to see Draco and Harry standing there.

Harry raised his arms in a surrender and said, ""I am not here to harm anyone. I want to talk.""

Voldemort nodded. ""Of course come in. Thank you for bringing him Draco.""

Draco nodded and went back to Hogwarts so his absence would not be noticed.

""What did you want to talk about?""

""Dumbledore."" Harry growled.

""Ah, no longer his puppet are you?""

""Nope.""

""Good, let's hear it then.""

So, Harry told Voldemort everything, from his upbringing to the latest manipulation of the Headmaster and his mate rejecting him. His days were numbered. Voldemort made sure Harry was okay and that he would take down Albus after Harry was gone. Harry thanked him. Voldemort offered him to stay there until his passing. Harry agreed. He didn't want to see Dumbledore or his former mate. He wrote his friends saying he was safe, but dying. Voldemort set up a meeting for him at Gringotts and Harry made an iron-clad will, one that would be sent directly to several people once he passed. Dumbledore would receive nothing. He even wrote a letter to his mate apologizing for being such an awful mate and that he hoped he would find happiness once everything was over.

Three days after Severus rejected him, Harry died peacefully in his sleep.

His will was released and so was a bunch of information about Dumbledore. Dumbledore was arrested and sentenced to 100 years in Azkaban with suppression cuffs on and then would be given the kiss. Voldemort took over the Ministry and got the Wizarding traditions back, including classes and books at Hogwarts. He got rid of laws against creatures. He also helped incorporate laws that would limit muggles in the Wizarding World. He founded an orphanage for people like him and Harry. The Wizarding World benefited from all these things. They saw an increase of wizard children and stronger magic. They had no idea that Dumbledore had been limiting their magic because he didn't think it was 'light' enough.

His friends had a private funeral for Harry and honored him by living their lives to the fullest they could.

Severus was shattered when he found out he inadvertently caused Harry's death. He hadn't mean to hurt Harry. That old barmy bastard manipulated him into it. When he first heard that he was Harry's mate, he was excited and hopeful. He didn't love him, but he could fall in love with him over time. He had to lie to the Headmaster and say those things because of his double spy role. He knew of Dumbledore's manipulations, but didn't think that he had pulled another one. He couldn't believe it when he heard about Harry's death. He went into shock and exploded his first ever potion. He destroyed his lab in his grief. He eventually calmed down and cried over the letter Harry wrote him. It was kind and understanding. He had even apologized for being such an awful mate that Severus didn't want him. He felt disappointed in himself. He wallowed for months after Harry's death. It took Draco to get him to his senses and smack him into reality. He knew Harry would not want this for him. So he packed up, travelled a lot, and experimented with potions. He lived and prospered. He greeted death at the old age of 140. Harry welcomed him with arms wide open and Severus gladly stepped into them. He was finally at peace.

He simply couldn't. This was not happening. No, this was just a bad dream he was having. A nightmare even. It had been a couple weeks since the tragedy, and Harry was still in complete and utter shock as well as denial. It just didn't feel real to him at all. His whole body was numb and he couldn't even manage to do simple things anymore like eating or sleeping. To him, those tasks were the equivalent of climbing a mountain. Of course, his two best friends had been very helpful but he had found himself snapping at them on more than one occasion. He was glad they cared about his well-being, but honestly he just wanted to be left alone. Harry knew he probably would be lonely for the rest of his life anyway; his lover was gone, and now he had nothing. Life suddenly meant nothing to him. He couldn't even bring himself to function like a normal human being, this was all too much and he couldn't handle it anymore. This person's death had hit him harder than anyone else he knew, even his Godfather. He had almost lost him once before, and now he really was gone. They had managed to save him in time after he'd been bitten by Voldemort's pet snake, Nagini. This was not how it was supposed to go. They were supposed to get married, grow old together, maybe even have a family together. Life truly was unfair.

Harry could feel tears build up in his eyes, yet again, at the memory of his former lover. ""Severus,"" he whispered softly into the cold air.

There was no answer, and despite the fact Harry didn't expect one, steady moving tears began to make their way down his pale, now almost gaunt, face.

Harry gripped the bed sheets in anger and looked at the empty space beside him. This wasn't supposed to be like this. He was supposed to wake up with a smile on face, roll over, and kiss his lover good morning. They were supposed to live a long, happy life together. Harry's anger disappeared after a few minutes and he allowed himself to curl up into a ball, pulling the covers over his head.

Why did you have to go and leave me? Harry thought miserably to himself as more tears slipped down his cheeks, beginning to soak his pillow.

He would have moments where he would be in complete disbelief that it ever even happened and other moments where the realisation of the situation would hit him, and he was in floods of tears and his heart ached in his chest. Severus was his soul mate, and losing him felt like a part of himself had died. They had spent all his school years hating each other, but more years loving each other after the war had ended.

""I will always love you,"" Harry spoke in a voice barely above a whisper. More tears spilled freely from his eyes. All he'd done these past couple weeks was feel nothing or everything. There was no in-between for him.

Harry couldn't wait for the day where they would meet again. One day, they would be reunited, and Harry anticipated that day more than anything else.

Until then, Harry would continue to exist with a broken heart."

It might be longer than that, really, but Monty had tried his hardest to ignore his feelings when they first started rearing their ugly head. Miller had been dating someone at the time, Bryan, and they were happy. So Monty squashed down his feelings and ignored them and pretended as though they didn't exist. But approximately two years ago, when Miller pulled up his sleeve to show Monty his newest tattoo, Monty couldn't deny that he was in love with him. 

""That is not the Deathly Hallows symbol,"" Monty said, gaping at the black ink across Miller's bicep. Miller smirked before rolling his sleeve back down to cover it. ""How long have you been into Harry Potter?"" Monty asked.

""How long have they been out?"" Miller returned smugly. ""Read the books growing up, went to all the midnight premieres that I could."" To Monty, Harry Potter was something that people just had to do. They had to read the books. They had to see the movies. It was like, a qualification for existing. But for some reason he'd never thought that Miller met that qualification. ""Why are you so surprised?"" Miller asked with a laugh. ""Everyone likes Harry Potter.""

""Not enough to get a tattoo,"" Monty pointed out. ""You're like, really into them. If you get a tattoo.""

""Thanks, Captain Obvious.""

""You're really into Harry Potter,"" Monty said again. And Miller nodded, confirming this. ""Like... really?"" 

""You're being a bit... riddiukulus,"" Miller said. He said the spell. Casually. Knowing Monty would pick up on it. Pronouncing it with a faint British accent. Like the freaking nerd.

And that was the day Monty knew that he was in love with Nathan Miller.

Monty readjusts the backpack on his shoulders and glances around the resort. Because they're in a resort. Harper's to his left and Raven's a few steps ahead of him and Bellamy and Clarke are leading the pack, marching up to the front desk to check them all in.

""Jesus,"" Raven murmurs and Monty can't help but agree. He isn't the type of person to go to resorts, let alone the Loews Royal Pacific Resort in Orlando Florida. The lobby is spotless and huge and decorated with fancy palm trees and there's a pond/fountain in a nearby courtyard and everything is so big. ""Are we at the right place?""

""Relax, Reyes,"" Murphy chimes, striding up behind them with Miller by his side. ""Griffin planned the whole thing, and we know she's too fucking organized to fuck up."" But still, he lets out a low whistle. ""Hopefully.""

The gang decided a few months back that they wanted to go to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. They all had enough money and all chipped in for a three-day trip to Florida. Fly in Sunday afternoon, stay at the resort Sunday night, spend all day Monday in Wizarding World (with a park-hopper pass so they can take the train!), all day Tuesday at the resort relaxing, and head back home on Wednesday afternoon. Monty doesn't feel like he's the type of person who deserves a vacation, but here he is, and he's with his best friends.

Clarke and Bellamy, Raven and Wells, Jasper and Maya, Lincoln and Octavia, Harper and Monroe, Miller and Murphy. Everyone's here. And they're going to Harry Potter World. All thirteen of them. It's going to be a damn shit-show, but it's going to be worth it.

""Guys!"" they hear. Monty looks over his shoulder to find Jasper striding toward them, dragging Maya along who clearly isn't walking fast enough for Jasper who's too excited to slow down. ""I got us leis!"" He lets go of Maya's hand who's smiling fondly at her boyfriend as Jasper places a lei over everyone's head one by one. ""Aloha,"" he says after every lei. ""Aloha. Aloha. Aloha.""

""Pink's your color, Murph,"" Harper says with a laugh.

Before Murphy can respond, Clarke is striding up to them with three sets of keycards. ""Got our keys!"" The trip itself was too much money, so instead of spending even more money on a giant suite, they instead booked three separate rooms (two of which connect with a door). ""Harper, Roe,"" Clarke says, passing them the keys, ""take your pick of our five singles.""

""Monty!"" Harper says quickly, just as Monroe says, ""Miller.""

""We'll take Raven and Wells and Murphy, then,"" Bellamy says, passing the key to Murphy. 

""Lincoln and Octavia,"" Clarke says, passing them their keys as well, ""you're with Jasper and Maya.""

""Perfect!"" Jasper cheers, not catching as Octavia rolls her eyes with a smile. Each room has two beds except for Clarke and Bellamy's, which has a couch that Murphy will probably crash on. ""Let's go!""

Everyone starts off in the direction of their rooms and Miller lingers back, knocking his elbow with Monty's. They're friends of course, but every time Miller touches Monty (which is cliche, okay? Monty knows he's being cliche), Monty feels warm. Miller and Bryan have been broken up for almost a full year now and they're going to be in Wizarding World tomorrow. Something magical is bound to happen... right?

""Pretty sure Monroe and Harper are going to want to share a bed,"" Miller says, and Monty struggles to fight the warmth that's crawling up his neck. ""So you're stuck with me.""

""Damn,"" Monty responds, trying not to sound too ecstatic, and Miller laughs.

It feels unfair, Monty thinks, sharing a bed with Miller. Would Miller want to sleep beside him if he knew how Monty felt? It's only okay, Monty is still thinking, because he himself is keeping to the far end of the mattress. He's perched so close to the edge that he could roll off in a second. The other side of the bed shifts and Monty tenses up when he hears Miller snort.

""I don't bite, Green,"" Miller murmurs softly so Harper and Monroe across the room can't hear. After settling in and grabbing a bite to eat at one of the restaurants in the resort, everyone came back and prepared to crash. They have to wake up early. ""And I showered today, so..."" he trails off, and Monty rolls to face him finding a curious look on his face. ""You okay?""

""Excited for tomorrow,"" Monty responds, his voice just as quiet. Miller offers him a smile, tipping his head forward in agreement. ""I wanted to give you space,"" Monty said. ""I, uh. Kick. In my sleep.""

Miller snorts again, and Monty feels himself ease up slightly. ""It's okay,"" Miller says. ""I've been told I hog the blankets."" Monty smiles and readjusts the pillow under him so he's cuddling it, looking toward Miller now instead of facing away. ""Get some sleep, Monty,"" he says softly. Monty nods, but the way Miller's looking at him is so warm and endearing it takes him a moment to actually close his eyes.

He falls asleep in minutes.

Monty wakes up before their wake-up call at 6, which is a good thing. Because despite his determination to stick to his side of the bed he's somehow ended up pressed against Miller. Monty's tucked into Miller's side, his head resting on Miller's chest, his hand draped across Miller's waist. It takes Monty a moment to realize that this is why he's so warm, because he and Miller are sharing a blanket and body heat, not because someone turned the heat on in the room. Monty shifts slightly but finds that Miller's hand has slipped into Monty's hair, fingers twisted through his locks as though he's done it a million times before. And beneath the blankets their ankles are entwined. Naturally. Like this has happened before. Like this was meant to happen.

Monty gives himself a beat to enjoy it. Miller's so warm and he looks so peaceful in his sleep. Even in the dark room Monty can make out his face, worry free and at ease, long eyelashes that are curled upwards. But if Miller wakes up and they're still like this...

It's tricky, but Monty manages to pry himself from Miller's grasp. It's slow moving and like playing reverse Tetris and Monty freezes every time Miller shifts slightly. By the time Monty's completely off the bed, crouched onto the floor considering he had to barrel roll off the bed, Miller's already curling into the warm spot that Monty left when he stood. Monty eases from his crouch and rubs at his eyes, looking across the room to find an amused Harper already awake, having watched the entire thing while sipping her morning coffee.

""Don't,"" Monty warns.

She holds up her hands. ""Didn't see a thing,"" she says with a smirk.

Miller is not a morning person, and Monty finds it to be the cutest thing in the world despite the fact that Miller is incredibly grumpy. He and Clarke both fuss and whine until they get a cup of coffee and it isn't until they're on the water-ferry over to Universal does the first semblance of a smile come across Miller's face.

""What?"" Raven asks with a hard elbow into Miller's arm. ""Didn't you sleep okay?""

Monty swears that Miller pales at the question. ""I slept perfectly,"" Miller answers her. ""But the sun is barely up, Reyes.""

""Be excited,"" Bellamy says from his seat with a smile. ""We're going to Wizarding World."" At that everyone smiles, and Monty finds himself pressing his lips together to keep his grin from hurting his face. ""Dreams are coming true today, kids."" Nope, Monty can't do it. His smile is hurting his face. He looks to Jasper who's grinning too. The two of them have been dreaming of this forever. Growing up down the street from one another they both sprinted to each other's houses on their birthday when they didn't get their acceptance letters to Hogwarts, and now they're going. Just for a day. And it's like, not real. But it totally is real, too, and Monty's probably going to die a little at some point today. ""Gringotts first?"" Bellamy asks.

""Well we can't get on the train to Hogwarts--the other half of the park--until like, 8, or something,"" Raven says, looking to Clarke for confirmation who nods. ""So obviously we're going to Gringotts first.""

""I want to see Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes,"" Jasper says, evidenced by the purple shirt he's wearing with the WWW logo on it. Everyone's wearing some sort of Harry Potter apparel (and none of them match, which is somehow even more amazing that as a group they all have enough different items of Harry Potter clothing that they don't have to repeat). ""Monty and I tried making a dungbomb of our own when we were younger, remember?""

""They won't have real dungbombs,"" Monty says with a little laugh, smiling at the memory. ""I don't think. God that would be amazing. Can you imagine?""

""I want a wand,"" Clarke says. ""We're going to Ollivanders.""

""Interactive wand,"" Wells says nudging her. ""It has to be interactive! To do the spells!"" Clarke agrees with the same level of enthusiasm to her friend and Bellamy grins, reaching out and tangling his fingers with Clarke's before squeezing once.

""Don't worry,"" he tells Clarke, though Monty knows it's for all of them. ""We're doing everything.""

Monty laughs and turns to find Miller looking at him, that still-soft smile on his face. He winks when he catches Monty's eyes.

While waiting in line the thirteen of them sort one another. They get to enter the park an hour early because they stayed at a Universal resort, but they're still an hour early for the gates to actually open. Some people are easily sorted (Octavia and Bellamy are placed in Gryffindor without any objections, same with Wells and Lincoln for Hufflepuff) while others are a little trickier to get a consensus on.

Octavia is overly frustrated as she shouts, ""Clarke is not a Gryffindor!""

""She's obviously a Slytherin,"" Murphy agrees. ""Takes one to know one, yeah?""

""You're just saying she's a Gryff because you are,"" Miller says to Bellamy, both of which who've placed their hands on their hips in the middle of this debate.

""Also Griffin and Gryffindor just sounds right, but feels wrong,"" Monty agrees.

""Raven's in Ravenclaw,"" Clarke protests, pointing toward her friend.

""Which is an accurate sorting,"" Wells protests back.

""She could be a SlytherGryff,"" Harper tries to add, but everyone dismisses her. Dual houses of course are a thing, but when you're buying merchandise you can't just merge houses. You have to pick one. The Sorting Hat would make you choose. ""Ugh, what does Clarke want, then?"" Harper asks after Monty points this out. ""Slytherin or Gryffindor? The Sorting Hat would ask.""

Clarke thinks on this for a moment, her lips curling into a smile before she shrugs slightly. ""Dunno.""

Miller and Murphy roll their eyes at the same time before both saying, ""Slytherin.""

""Whatever,"" she says, waving her hand as Bellamy gapes at her. ""Let's move on. Miller's definitely in--""

""Hufflepuff,"" Monty says. Everyone turns to look at Monty, including Miller who has a curious eyebrow arched. It's fun to play devil's advocate sometimes, because Miller is certainly not in Hufflepuff. ""Hard worker,"" Monty says, lifting his hand to count on his fingers. ""Incredibly loyal to us. Incredibly dedicated.""

""Is the least patient person I've ever met in my life,"" Bellamy cuts him off. ""And doesn't give a shit about fair play.""

""I know you're just trying to get a discussion going,"" Raven says to Monty, placing a hand on his shoulder. ""Because even you know that Miller's definitely a Slytherin.""

""Cunning,"" Clarke agrees, ""ambitious, cares about self-preservation.""

Monty rolls his eyes, turning to look at Miller who's in the middle of licking his lips in amusement. They quickly move onto someone else, most everyone agreeing Miller's a Slytherin, and Miller steps through the crowd of their friends to stand by Monty's side.

""You really think I'm a Hufflepuff?"" Miller asks, his voice verging on offended.

""Okay, not really,"" Monty says. ""But it's a fun thought."" Miller purses his lips, tipping his head. ""Isn't it? Nathan Miller, patient and playing by the rules.""

""But it's a wrong thought,"" Miller murmurs back, his mouth curling into a smile. ""I could put you in Hufflepuff too,"" he says, ""if we're playing select-the-trait. But you're a Ravenclaw.""

""I am,"" Monty agrees with a nod. ""And you're a Slytherin.""

""I look better in green anyway,"" Miller jokes. His eyes darken like he wants to say something else, and then Miller licks his lips again before laughing to himself and turning away. Monty's just about to ask him what's so funny when the gates open and everyone starts cheering. ""C'mon, Green,"" Miller says with a grin, getting back in line. ""Wizarding World awaits.""

They sprint.

""It's not even 9 in the morning,"" Maya says as they exit the Gringotts ride, ""and we've already seen Voldemort."" Jasper laughs and squeezes her hand tightly. Clarke's still in the bank, buying the photos of everyone, and Monty's in a daze.

He's here he's here he's really here. They were rushed toward Gringotts the second they arrived, something about keeping things running smoothly, and Monty barely had any time to look around. Jasper cried out as they passed Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes but they kept moving, and he's on a hurry to get back to the shop. They're in the courtyard now waiting for everyone to gather their things from the lockers they had to put their stuff in and he's just absorbing it all. It looks so real. It looks like they're in Diagon Alley. Slanted roofs and cobbled streets and a real air of excitement about it all, an air of magic.

""Okay?"" he hears, turning to find Miller approaching him. Monty nods before turning back to take it all in. ""Raven says Ollivander's, and then to the Leaky Cauldron for a late breakfast. And then the Weasleys' so Jasper doesn't implode.""

""The Leaky Cauldron,"" Monty echoes with a little laugh. ""God, I can't believe we're here."" Miller bumps him lightly and Monty turns to look again. There isn't a bright smile on Miller's face but his eyes are so warm that Monty knows he's happy. ""I'm 22 years old,"" Monty says to him. ""Should I really be getting this excited about Harry Potter?""

""Um, yes,"" Miller answers. ""I've already started wondering if I should splurge buy robes from Madam Malkin's,"" he says, and Monty laughs again.

The workers at Harry Potter world must know that these thirteen adults are the biggest nerds in the world, because instead of filling in the little showroom in Ollivander's Shop with other patrons they stop it so it's just the thirteen of them.

""A little too old for Hogwarts,"" the wandmaker hums when he glances around the room. ""But I suppose a lot of people lost their wands while fighting in the war..."" When Jasper gets chosen from the crowd to get his own wand, Monty's heart both sinks and soars in excitement for his friend. ""And you,"" the wandmaker says, pointing in Monty's direction. ""Captain of Ravenclaw's Wizards Chess Team,"" he says, reading off of Monty's custom-made shirt. ""Is that new? I wasn't aware Hogwarts started one of those. Yes, up here!""

""Monty,"" Jasper nearly cries, placing his hands on Monty's shoulders. ""We were chosen.""

""We were chosen,"" Monty repeats breathlessly, knowing that his voice is shaking. Their friends laugh and ooh and aah as Monty and Jasper try out their wands (making things in the shop go wrong, of course), and when the magical light glows and the fan blows as they find their correct wands, everyone in the room cheers. Twin cores for two connected wizards, best friends, brothers. Soon enough the wandmaker is ushering them through to the rest of the shop. ""We were chosen,"" Monty says another time, turning to Jasper in excitement. ""You and me!""

""To the grave,"" Jasper agrees, his voice high and loud as they clasp one another's arms and move from the shop. ""Maya!"" Jasper calls over his shoulder, turning to his girlfriend. ""I was chosen!""

""I know, Jasper,"" she says with a laugh.

""I'm getting a wand!""

Monty's sort of in a daze when he enters the rest of Ollivander's, and he ends up dragged toward a showcase where a whole bunch of wands are displayed. ""Cedar,"" Miller reads off from the case. ""Strength of character and unusual loyalty. Perspicacity and perception."" He looks to Monty and adds, ""That means you're good at reading people.""

""Oh, Nate,"" Monty says with a little laugh. ""It's just chance that my wand ended up Cedar, that doesn't mean I'm actually--""

""Potential to be a frightening adversary,"" he carries on. ""Which often comes as a shock to those who have thoughtlessly challenged them,"" Miller says. He leans in then, his mouth so close to Monty's ear that Monty can feel his warm breath, and says, ""You'd be an amazing wizard."" Monty feels his breath hitch in his throat, but he can't turn to face Miller. ""Smart and powerful,"" he adds. ""Cedar's a good one for you.""

By the time Monty finally turns to look at him, Miller has moved on to find a wand of his own.

""Me, me, me!"" Clarke whines, reaching for the mug in Bellamy's hands. He takes another long drink before passing her the mug of warm Butterbeer that he ordered. ""How is it?"" she asks before lifting it to her own mouth.

""Magical,"" he answers, causing Raven to snort.

Monty's ordered himself a cup of pumpkin juice and they're all eating quickly, caught between wanting to savor their food and move on to the next thing. They're probably splitting up soon after this to get some shopping done and just wander around before meeting up to head over to Hogwarts (oh my gosh) and do the rides over there. It's supposed to be more crowded there so they want to spend some time in Diagon Alley before heading over.

""Not the Elder Wand?"" Monty asks as Miller pulls out his wand box, looking at the map of interactive spells. He's referencing Miller's tattoo, the one that made Monty realize he was in love with a nerd, but Miller doesn't seem to get it. He frowns, turning to face Monty. ""What?"" he asks.

""Fuck Dumbledore,"" Miller says. Monty blanches. ""Shithead raised Harry Potter just to throw him to the wolves, left him in a shitty abusive household, purposefully kept information from the kid."" Miller shakes his head. Monty blinks a few times, surprised to find that Miller has such strong negative feelings about Dumbledore. ""Like hell I want that asshole's wand.""

""I meant--your tattoo,"" Monty clarifies.

""Oh."" Miller offers him a sheepish smile. ""Sorry. I have a lot of feelings about Dumbledore."" Miller looks down at the box in his hands and tries to bite back his smile. ""I forgot I showed you my tattoo,"" he says. ""I haven't... really...""

""What tattoo?"" Raven asks, butting in.

""Nothing,"" Miller mutters.

""Wait--that's a--"" secret?

""What tattoo!"" Raven demands. Everyone turns to look at Miller now who's rapidly turning red.

""Deathly Hallows symbol,"" he murmurs. Raven nudges him, not hearing him, and Miller repeats it louder. ""I got it a few years ago.""

""Show us!"" Miller's forced to push his sleeve up to show everyone the tattoo and Raven laughs brilliantly. His biceps are covered with different patterns, different dark lines and drawings. Miller has his shirt off all the time but his tattoo blends in seamlessly you can't find it unless you know where to look. (Monty does.) ""I had no idea you were such a nerd!""

""You talked about getting the Harry Potter stars on your shoulder,"" Wells reminds her, ""don't even start.""

""Anyway,"" Miller returns to his conversation with Monty. ""I love the hallows,"" he says when everyone else starts talking again. ""I constantly bounce between which of them I'd want the most, truthfully. They're just fascinating to me, and the story with the three brothers..."" he trails off. ""But I hate Dumbledore, so I'm not getting his wand.""

Monty hesitates. ""Snape?"" he asks.

Miller looks up with dark eyes. ""I hate Dumbledore, you think I'm going to like that shit stain Severus Snape?"" he asks. Miller slumps a little bit. ""Monty Green, I swear to God if you're pro-Snape--""

""Stop,"" Monty cuts him off with a laugh. ""No. Jasper is, but he's the worst. Literally."" Miller seems to sigh with relief. ""Who's wand did you get then?"" Monty asks, leaning closer to try and read the label. ""Does that... Draco?"" he asks.

Miller tips his head into a nod and shrugs slightly. ""To be fair I wanted Regulus, but they didn't have an interactive wand for him."" Miller pulls out Draco's wand. ""It wasn't his fault he was raised in a fucked up household. It pisses me off he didn't get the redemption arc he deserved but Snape did. Or well, almost did. Tried to."" Monty smiles at that before lifting his cup of pumpkin juice to his mouth. ""You're judging me.""

""Am not. It's cute.""

""Cute?"" Miller asks, arching an eyebrow, and Monty nods. ""Oh--shut up, Green. Who would you have gotten if you hadn't been chosen?""

""Hermione,"" he answers without missing a beat.

""I always thought she'd end up with Draco,"" Octavia says from her seat after snatching a piece of bacon from Lincoln's plate as she joins the conversation a beat too late to realize they were just speaking about that character. ""He had some stuff to work through, serious stuff, but it totally could've worked.""

""Ron and Hermione are cute, though,"" Lincoln says with a frown.

""Hermione was supposed to be with one of the Weasley twins,"" Monroe calls from down the table. ""That would've been perfect!""

Monty's face is still warm, thinking about two people who might not seem like they'd fit together actually working out.

Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes is pretty packed and gets even more crowded when the gang enters, and though Jasper wishes it was bigger they still go around every corner and look at every item available for purchase. The Quidditch shop is connected so some people head over there to look at team gear (Monroe wants a Slytherin Quidditch Captain shirt). Monty takes a million photos of Jasper and then Maya takes a million photos of Monty and Jasper. Murphy convinces Raven and Wells to go to Knockturn Alley with him and Monty tries out his interactive wand (which works) and mostly, so much magic is happening that it feels real.

""We have to visit Sirius,"" Clarke says at one point. ""Apparently sometimes you can see Kreacher through the window.""

""Confirmed,"" Monty tells her as they gather their bags. ""I read a whole bunch of stuff online. Oh my God, we should all try and fit in the telephone booth!""

The gang has to backtrack a bit to get done everything they want to and they keep splitting up and reconvening, but everyone is so desperate to see everything that no one really minds it feels like a rush.

Everyone gathers to talk to Stan Shunkpike at the Knight Bus, they get people to take photos of all 13 of them on the steps of 12 Grimmauld Place, they try and fit everyone into the telephone booth after calling the Ministry of Magic a dozen time so everyone can hear the pre-recorded message. Everything is happening, everything is happening, everything is magic.

The gang fills Madam Malkin's and everyone tries on robes (without intent to purchase them, because they're like, $110) to take pictures before going to the next shop. And the next shop. And the next shop.

By the time they make it to the Hogwarts Express (there's a mirror that makes it look like you're disappearing into the wall which, again, everyone stops for pictures of) Monty's so tired. When he settles into his compartment, Jasper to his left and Miller on the seat in front of him, he realizes that his head hurts. A lot. He blinks hard a few times before reaching over Jasper's lap to the bag that Maya's carrying so he can pull out a water bottle.

""You okay?"" Miller asks, a tinge of worry to his voice.

""Headache,"" Monty admits. Still, he forces a soft smile to his face. ""Haven't been drinking enough water, I guess.""

""Maybe you should go back to your room and lay down for a bit,"" Clarke says already in full worry-mode. Monty rolls his eyes so hard that it eases his headache for a second. ""Okay. Or not. But maybe Raven has some aspirin or something?""

""We'll check when we're off the train,"" Miller insists.

Dementors attack the Hogwarts Express and the virtual-window doesn't really help Monty's headache, but it's still an enjoyable ride. It's nice to sit down for a bit too. Miller keeps looking at him with his eyebrows furrowed, concerned, but Monty waves it off. Because they're in Wizarding World. And there is absolutely no time for headaches. And there's even less time for headaches once everyone digs through their stuff to figure out that there is no aspirin with absolutely anyone.

""I'll just drink a lot of water,"" Monty says. ""Really! I'm fine."" Bellamy doesn't look like he believes him, and Wells wrinkles his nose, but no one argues. Because, seriously, there's no time for headaches.

As anticipated, Hogsmeade and the Wizarding World that's over in Islands of Adventure is much more crowded. Monty figures that if people don't have park-hopper passes it makes more sense to actually visit Hogwarts instead of Gringotts, and this area is much larger anyway. Despite his headache Monty is still full of joy. It's the middle of April and annoyingly warm outside but Hogsmeade has snow on the rooftops of every building and it just looks so real. If the place wasn't packed with people it would really feel like they were there.

""Straight to Hogwarts,"" Raven says, leading the gang through the crowds of people that are lined up for Butterbeer and casting spells at the windows of shops, knowing that it's going to be the longest line to wait in. ""After that we can go to the Dragon Challenge? Or the Flight of the Hippogriff?""

""We'll figure it out,"" Octavia dismisses her.

Approaching Hogwarts is... breathtaking. It's smaller than a real castle, obviously, but the detail is so fascinating. Again everyone takes pictures. There are so many pictures. Everyone is taking pictures. Because they're here. ""We're here!"" Jasper cheers. And so does Harper. And so does Octavia. And so does everyone because they've finally made it. Years of waiting to go to Hogwarts has finally paid off, because they made it. Magic may not really exist but in this moment it certainly feels like it does.

Everyone hurries into the line (though Murphy insists that waiting in the single-rider line will be faster they go in the group line anyway) and prepares to wait. They're only there for a few minutes when Miller announces, ""I've got to piss.""

""Too bad,"" Murphy says. ""We're in like, an hour wait of a line.""

""Actually I'm just going to go now,"" Miller says.

""You are not whipping your dick out,"" Raven says at once (which turns the heads of a few parents). Miller rolls his eyes and starts wedging out of line. ""They'll never let you back in!""

""We'll see,"" Miller murmurs. And then he's gone.

Monty also has to pee, considering he's been chugging water in an attempt to lessen the pounding of his head (which isn't working, by the way) but it's not that bad, and he figures he can wait for a bit. Miller returns fifteen minutes later, pushing past everyone in line telling them to mind their own business before he finally reaches the gang.

""Green,"" he says, and Monty looks up. Miller tosses him two packets of ibuprofen and a bottle of Gillywater. ""Take that,"" Miller nearly orders. Monty blinks a few times, and a few of their friend watch the interaction.

""Where'd you get it?"" Monty asks.

""Went to the gift shop,"" he says. Instead of going to the bathroom, probably, Monty is realizing. Miller tips his head. ""For Christ's sake, just take it."" Still looking at Miller Monty rips open the first packet, knocking back the pills, and then the second. ""Keep drinking water though, yeah?""

""Yeah,"" Monty echoes quietly. ""Thanks, Nate.""

Miller smiles crookedly, half of his face curving upward as he ducks his head into a small nod before turning his attention to Bellamy beside him.

The line moves slowly and Monty keeps catching Miller's eye, pleased to find the same small smile on his face every time. They grow farther apart considering there are 13 of them waiting but Monty can't stop looking at him. Nathan Miller is so freaking cute that Monty feels like he's going to explode because of it.

Someone settles against the bar beside Monty and thinking it's Jasper Monty sighs. ""I'm super in love with him,"" he says quietly.

When he turns his head and finds that Raven's the one beside him, Monty's face turns red in a flash. ""Oh yeah?"" she asks with a grin. ""But are you in love with him because we're in Wizarding World? Or because you're in love with him?""

""Shut up Raven,"" Monty forces out. ""I thought you were Jasper.""

""Well I'm not.""

""Too many people,"" Monty adds, looking around at their friends to see who's listening. The answer is: no one. ""Both,"" he answers.

Raven's grin widens. ""Alright, Monty."" She looks toward Miller, then back at Monty. ""You've got to make your move, then.""

""That's actually something I don't have to do,"" Monty says. Rejection is terrifying. Rejection from Nathan Miller would be devastating.

""Remember those billboards that were up on our drive in from the airport?"" Raven asks. ""There were all those Disney ones, and then all the Universal ones. Like we didn't know we were in Orlando."" Monty dips his head into a nod. ""Do you remember what the Harry Potter ones said?"" she asks.

Monty frowns. ""Yeah.""

""Well?""

""Courage is Universal,"" Monty mutters.

She nudges him with her elbow, still smiling. ""And where are we?"" she asks.

""Harry Potter world,"" Monty mutters again.

""Mm-hm,"" she hums. The line moves forward and Raven tugs on his arm. ""This place is magic, Monty. Not literally, but I'm telling you.""

""I'll make a move when you do,"" he tosses back, glancing over his shoulder at Wells. Raven purses her lips to stop herself from smirking, and Monty lifts his eyebrows in a challenge. ""Deal?""

""Deal,"" she says. And then Raven pushes off of the bar she's leaning against, past Monroe and Harper, between Clarke and Wells by grabbing by his shirt and pulling him down. She kisses him firmly as Octavia whistles and Lincoln laughs warmly and everyone else watches in shock. When they part Wells' face is red but he's smiling goofily and Raven's just as bright. ""Okay?"" she asks him.

Wells coughs awkwardly, never really liking being the center of attention despite his bright smile, and dips his head into a nod. ""Definitely,"" he answers.

Raven eases into the spot by Wells' side looking happier than ever and shoots Monty a look. Your move, it says.

By the time they actually get to ride Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, Monty's headache is gone completely. He's not sure if it's completely due to the medicine Miller got him or just the fact that Miller is literally the best and it's so cute that Monty's headache was like ""I don't have time for this"" and vanished. Maybe a mixture of both.

People split up after the ride another time, some heading toward some rollercoasters and others heading toward Hog's Head Pub to get some more Butterbeer and sit in the shade for a bit, which is where Monty chooses to go. Miller takes the seat beside Monty, Clarke across from them, and asks about his head.

""I really do feel better,"" Monty says, ignoring the pointed look that Clarke is giving him. ""I'm not just saying that so Clarke will stop worrying, either,"" he adds.

She huffs. ""I don't worry.""

""You do,"" Bellamy tells her. ""Constantly.""

""Like you don't,"" she huffs back, causing him to laugh.

""Thank you again,"" Monty says to Miller as Bellamy and Clarke squabble. ""I really--I don't even know what to say."" Miller shrugs, and is that--is he bashful? ""Hufflepuff,"" Monty adds quietly. The laugh that erupts out of Miller in response is so bright and so brilliant that Monty can't even stop himself from grinning. Monty quickly lifts his Butterbeer to his lips and takes a big drink to cover the pink in his cheeks.

""God forbid I do something kind,"" Miller says as Monty drinks, ""for someone I care about. Suddenly everything is upside down and my house is yanked out from under me."" Monty lowers his drink. Someone I care about. He stares at Miller wanting him to say more but he doesn't. He just meets Monty's gaze for a long time. Finally he blinks. ""You've got..."" Miller trails off, reaching up to brush Monty's lip with his thumb. ""Foam."" Miller pulls his thumb back to his mouth and sucks off the foam he wiped up before licking his lips.

Monty's voice shakes, ""Want a sip?""

Miller grins. ""Sure."" He takes a drink of Monty's Butterbeer before licking his lips another time, slow and intentional and Monty can't stop staring. ""It's really good,"" Miller says.

""It is,"" Monty agrees.

Neither of them notice Bellamy and Clarke have been watching the entire interaction.

""Please.""

""No.""

""Please,"" Miller is practically whining to Clarke and Monty can't stop smiling. ""It's two steps away. Jurassic Park is two steps away and you're saying no to me?"" Miller steps in front of Clarke with a frown. ""Jurassic Park,"" he says again. ""Jurassic Park River Adventure,"" Miller adds.

""C'mon,"" Monty says with a laugh, nudging Miller. ""I'll go with you.""

Miller brightens. ""Yeah?""

""Me too,"" Harper adds, and Monroe nods too. ""It's hot. I could use a splash!""

""Count me in,"" Murphy says, starting off too.

""Clarke, please,"" Bellamy pleads. ""We have express passes!""

While Wizarding World is, well, Wizarding World, Jurassic Park, is... well... Jurassic Park . There are dinosaurs. Universal is amazing, and Monty never wants to leave. Thankfully Jurassic Park is right next to Wizarding World so they're not too far away. After they ride a few dinosaur related rides they're heading back to Hogsmeade, meeting up with Jasper and Octavia's group, and then probably taking the Hogwarts Express back to Diagon Alley to get some shopping done.

Every time Monty looks at Miller he wants to be like Raven, he wants to be brave. He wants to push himself on his toes and grab Miller's shirt and tug him down and kiss him. But he's not a Gryffindor, and he's not brave, and the thought of doing that scares the literal crap out of him. But sometimes, maybe, Monty will catch Miller's eyes and it feels like he's waiting for something too. The same thing.

It's because we're in Universal, Monty reminds himself. You're in love with him always, but he's caught up in Universal. And maybe that's not even true, maybe Monty's making it up, the way that Miller's looking at him. Like he's half wizard and half... something else magical. Phoenix, maybe. Half phoenix.

The water ride is a lot of fun (though they end up soaked) but Monty wants to head back to Hogsmeade and buy some chocolate frogs from Honeydukes. Bellamy convince Clarke and Murphy to ride a few more things and Miller considers staying with them before changing his mind and following Harper, Monroe, and Monty back toward Wizarding World. He lingers back, talking to Monroe quietly, while Harper and Monty lead the way.

""I can't wait to take a nap,"" Monty says, rubbing at his eyes. ""Are we still going to Hard Rock for dinner?""

""My cousin works for corporate,"" Harper says with a nod, ""so we've got reservations, and a pretty large gift card to spend.""

The start crossing the bridge back to Wizarding World and Monty's tugging at his shirt as though urging it to dry a little faster when he pauses.

""Green!"" Miller calls, waving his hand over. He's stopped on the bridge, the view of Hogwarts behind him, and thrusts his phone in Monrore's direction but jerks his head backwards, motioning for Monty to stand next to him. ""Get your ass over here."" This is a pretty good view of the castle and the bridge isn't all that crowded so it's perfect to stop and take a picture.

Monty gives Harper a look but she shrugs innocently, and still tugging on his wet shirt he strides over to join Miller in the photo.

""To the left, Monty,"" Monroe calls, holding up Miller's phone to take a picture. ""Stand closer!""

""Oh,"" Harper huffs. ""For the love of...""

""Here,"" Miller says lowly. He reaches toward Monty, his hand cupping Monty's cheek, and then before Monty even knows what's happening Miller's kissing him. Miller's kissing him. Monty freezes. Miller's kissing him. Quick and warm and--oh my God. He pulls back after a moment and Monty's lips part, warmer than they were two seconds ago, and everything is still. He blinks his eyes open just in time to watch Miller lick his lips. ""Sorry, I just..."" he trails softly, preparing to step back, but Monty's finally processing it and his hands move just in time.

Monty grabs Miller's stupid wet Slytherin shirt and tugs him forcefully back to him. ""Mmf,"" Monty groans as Miller's mouth meets his and then Miller's hand is back on Monty's cheek, keeping his chin tipped up so he can kiss with ease.

""Wow, that's better,"" Miller murmurs, but he's grinning so widely that every kiss is barely even a kiss. Somewhere Harper and Monroe are cheering but all Monty can focus on pulling Miller closer. ""I should've asked first,"" Miller breathes against Monty's lip. ""Sorry.""

""Shhh-ut up,"" Monty exhales. Miller's still grinning and Monty's mouth is getting there too and breathy laughs escape them before they stop completely, holding one another close with their foreheads pinned together. ""I was supposed to do that first,"" Monty says.

Miller snatches another kiss. ""You were taking too long,"" he says. ""Reyes kept talking about those stupid fucking Harry Potter billboards and I just--"" Monty arches up, shutting Miller up with his mouth. This time Miller groans, his hands snaking down to Monty's hips to tug him against him. Monty could spend the rest of the trip here, like this, crushed against Miller. Seriously. ""Monty,"" Miller whispers his name against his lips and Monty melts. ""Come on,"" he pants, pulling back. ""Let's go to Honeydukes.""

It isn't until they're back on path to Hogsmeade, fingers laced, does Monroe hand Miller his phone back. ""You planned that,"" Monty says when Miller slips his phone back into his pocket. ""You wanted a photo.""

""You bet your sweet ass I did,"" Miller says.

""What if I'd, like, smacked you? Instead?"" Monty asks.

Miller shrugs. ""I was willing to bet I wasn't reading the signs wrong,"" he tells Monty, squeezing his hand once. ""Also Raven has a big mouth."" Monty laughs and Miller tugs his arm so he looks up at him. They slow a bit, letting Harper and Monroe ahead of them get a bit of a lead, and Monty waits for him to speak. ""This isn't..."" he starts, and stops, and Monty pauses completely. ""I didn't read the signs wrong, right?"" he asks. ""I mean Raven said--but I just..."" Miller trails off, looking nervous. ""I want to be with you."" Monty takes a smaller step toward him, ignoring the rushing sound in his ears at just hearing Miller say it so plainly. ""You want to be with me too,"" he wonders, ""right? I didn't--I didn't fuck that up?""

""Yeah, Nate,"" Monty says gently. ""I want to be with you too. God, since you got that stupid deathly hallows tattoo I've just been..."" Monty trails off at the smile on Miller's face. ""Don't do that,"" Monty says with a laugh, shaking his head. ""Stop making that face!""

Miller leans in then, his mouth near Monty's ear, and whispers teasingly, ""After all this time?""

Monty playfully shoves Miller's chest. ""Don't you dare,"" he says with a grin. Miller catches Monty's cheek and pulls him back to kiss him again. He could kiss him forever. Monty's breath catches in his throat. ""Always,"" he manages.

Miller laughs into his mouth. ""I fucking hate both of them,"" Miller forces out between short, rapid kisses that Monty chases with his lips, referencing Dumbledore and Snape and their conversation from earlier. ""But God, I love you.""

Raven winks in Monty's direction when she sees him holding hands with Miller, Jasper whisper-shouts finally!, and Clarke and Bellamy both nod their head in approval.

The rest of the day is a whirlwind of memories Monty's only sure happened because he takes pictures of them. The Weasley Twins make an appearance on the second ride of the Hogwarts Express and Jasper shrieks in joy, everyone gets ice cream cones from Florean Forescue's and Monty kisses the corner of Miller's mouth when some of it stays behind, and everyone lingers back to watch the performance of The Tale of Three Brothers.

Monty has to stop himself from leaning his forehead on Miller's arm as they watch the show (it feels too comfortable too fast and he hasn't the slightest idea about how Miller feels about public things, even though they practically made out in front of the entire Wizarding World). The actors and actresses tell the story of the Three Brothers with puppets and even cast some spells which has the crowd gasping and oohing and aahing at how realistic they seem and are pulled off. He watches Miller's reaction to a lot of it, reveling in the fact that he's allowed to do that now. Monty's allowed to stare at him without feeling weird about it.

When Miller laughs at something Monty misses (because he's staring, whoops) he turns to look at Monty's reaction too. Their eyes meet for a moment before Miller leans in and kisses him gently, and then returns to watching the show. It's such a natural, familiar gesture that Monty decides to lean his head against Miller's arm anyway.

It feels like they've been together for ages.

Dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe on City Walk is fancy and elaborate but such a nice way to end their long, magic-filled day. And when they finally return to their resort after filling themselves with expensive drinks and even more expensive food, Monty's ready to crash.

""We're headed to the hot tub for a bit,"" Harper says after they get back, as though their day wasn't exhausting and they don't want to go right to sleep. ""Want to come?"" she asks.

Miller sinks onto to edge of the bed that Monty's already collapsed on and shakes his head. ""I think we're good here.""

""Figures,"" Monroe says with a laugh. She grabs her girlfriend's hand and Harper winks over her shoulder as they exit the room, leaving Monty and Miller alone together.

Miller glances down at Monty who feels like he's already inches from sleep before crawling across the bed to him. He straddles his hips over Monty's and Monty groans when Miller leans in to kiss him. Despite the exhaustion in Monty's bones he manages to reach up, pushing the hem of Miller's shirt up so he knows to pull it off.

""So tired,"" Monty murmurs as he pulls Miller back down for another kiss. Because dammit, he'll fight off sleep if he can do this a little longer. His hands glide up Miller's bare chest as Miller kisses Monty's chin, Monty's throat. ""Nate,"" he sighs, and can feel him grinning into Monty's neck.

""Tired,"" Miller exhales against his skin. ""Got it."" He collapses on the bed beside Monty. ""Come here, then,"" he says, pulling his boyfriend toward him and holding him tightly in his arms, his back flush against Miller's chest. This is good, this is easy, this is right. ""Did you have a good day?"" Miller asks quietly, to which Monty nods in response. ""Favorite part?""

""Right now,"" Monty exhales sleepily.

Miller grins, leaning in and kissing Monty's neck another time. ""Really? I liked Gringotts."" Monty snorts and rolls to face Miller who dips so their noses brush.

""I liked being chosen,"" Monty says softly. ""In Ollivanders.""

""The Hogwarts ride was nice too,"" Miller adds.

""And when we all tried to fit into the phone booth."" Miller's grin eases into something softer, something more gentle, something Monty wants more of every day. They watch each other silently for a few moments and Monty wonders if Miller's thinking the same thing. That he's wanted this for so long. That getting this, getting to be with one another, feels like a blessing. ""Love you,"" Monty whispers. Miller leans up to kiss Monty's nose. A perfect end to a perfect day.

""Love you too,"" Miller whispers back.

Sounds of raindrops hitting the roof of 4 Privet Drive, the residents inside were completely oblivious to the downpour as they were fast asleep cozy and warm except those in the cupboard under the stairs.

Inside, only whispers and sniffles were to be heard. 

A boy and a girl with lightning bolt scars on their forehead & broken glasses shivered against one another as they tried to warm one another by being in each other's embrace. Trying their best to ignore the slight chill creeping through the cracks of the door, they wiped away their tears, not wanting to wake up those upstairs. 

Gently dabbing at the small cuts on the boy's arm, the girl did her best to wipe away the excess blood using the cleanest part of her tattered shirt to the best of her ability as the boy tried to stay quiet.

""It hurt...?""

Shaking his head, he forced a small smile at the girl. The girl wasn't convinced seeing the boy grip onto the dirty mattress.

""M' sorry... because of me..."" 

Unable to hold back the guilty tears, she silently wept into her hands as the boy shook his head and tried to calm the crying girl.

""Not your fault. It's okay.""

""Sorry... M' sorry...""

Earlier that evening, the twins were tasked with cooking dinner for their family, the Dursleys'. Mr. Dursley had demanded the two to pick up the pace as Mrs. Dursley watched over the two like a hawk and yelled out threats not to mess up. Their son, Dudley, was wailing to the top of his lungs about his hunger. 

Working as fast as possible, Mrs. Dursley went to her son to calm the crying boy as Mr. Dursley smiled whilst promising his son a new toy for being a good boy. 

""Now, now, my Duddikins. Dinner will be ready soon.""

""BUT I'M HUNGRY NOW! I WANT MY FOOD!""

""And you will, son. If you can wait a little longer, I promise I'll get you that toy car you wanted the other day.""

""R-really?""

""Of course. Anything for my son."" Grinning at the promise from his father, the family ignored the twins in the kitchen.

""A-Almost done, Rose?""

""Y-yeah H-Harry, I-I just-""

""STOP YOUR CHATTING AND HURRY UP WITH OUR DINNER!"" Mr.Dursley demanded.

""--Yes sir-!"" The two squeaked as Harry placed the food onto the plate and served it to the table. Rose, panicking, she wasn't fast enough, grabbed the two plates to only slip as she walked off the step-ladder and dropped the plates onto the floor. Harry was the first to flinch at the sound as Mr. Dursley's face began to glow red at the sound.

""MY PLATES! WHY YOU CLUMSY-!"" Mrs. Dursley gripped Rose's arm with much force and began to slap her cheeks in a rage. 

""A-Aunt Petunia-!! N-No,p-please!"" Harry begged his aunt to stop, only to be pulled away and thrown aside to the living room.

""HOW DARE YOU STOP YOUR AUNT FROM CORRECTING YOUR FREAK OF A SISTER-! YOU NO-GOOD HOUSE SLOTH!"" 

""I-I'm s-sorry U-Uncle Vernon, b-but-""

""ARE YOU CORRECTING ME, BOY?!""

""N-No-! I-!""

""YOU UNGRATEFUL FREAK!"" Unbuckling his belt, he wrapped one end of the leather around his hand before bringing the buckle down onto the crying boy. 

Having finished her punishment on Rose, Petunia pushed the girl into the cupboard before walking to her husband to see he had finished his punishment as well. Dragging the shaking boy into the cupboard, he slammed the door shut and locked it.

""SPENDING A FEW DAYS INSIDE WITH NO FOOD OR WATER SHOULD TEACH YOU BOTH A LESSON.""

The rest of the evening, the twins listened to the family happily finishing their dinner and watching the telly together before heading to sleep. 

Turning off the lights, Vernon stopped in front of the cupboard and sneered at the shaking twins. 

""If you make a sound tonight and disturb our sleep, it'll be worse than no food or water."" 

Turning off the last light, he walked up the stairs without a care of the dust raining down upon the two. 

Within an hour, the house was quiet until the rain began to pour. 

""Rose... blanket."" Pushing the dirty thin blanket to his sister, Rose shook her head. 

""You need it more..."" 

""M' okay."" 

""...Let's share."" Barely covering them both, they tried to get comfortable as they held each other's hand and stared at one another. Like a phone line, they connected.


'You think mum and dad wanted us? Even though we're freaks?'



'...I don't know, but I hope they did.'



'Me too...'



'M' Sorry, you got hurt because of me...'


'It's okay. M' Sorry I couldn't help you...' 


'We'll be together... forever, right?'



'Always...'



'Do you think we'll have that dream again?'



'With Mum and Dad?;



'Padfoot and Moony, too.'



'... I can't remember who they are.'



'They're always blurry...'



'Yeah...'



'Guess they didn't want us either...'



'I wish we can have a family too.'



'Maybe... one day...'

That same evening at St. Mungo's Hospital, a tall man was visiting another man. 

""How is he?""

""He's progressing very nicely. He'll be able to leave in the next few days, but I must say he is a troublesome patient."" 

Chuckling, the tall man thanked the healer and walked towards the scruffy man in bed, muttering to himself. Sighing as he took a seat, he looked around to see any other healers were around. Seeing the room was empty of healers, he took out the bottle he was hiding under his coat and held it towards the scruffy man. Glancing over at the bottle, the man grinned as he helped himself up.

""Firewhiskey. Whatever is the occasion?""

""For you to stop being a pain for the healers.""

""I'm quite fine and 'sane' for your information-""

""The healers say otherwise."" Pulling his wand out of his sleeve; he resisted rolling his eyes to the scruffy man as two crystal cups floated towards them. 

""I don't have time to sit here, Remus. I need to-""

""I know. It's almost been six years...""

""Six years... I should've been with them. Six years of them being alone.""

""You and I are both at fault, but we'll be with them soon.""

""Yes... yes, you're right...""

Another 'freaky accident' occurs with Rose making Vernon and Petunia explode.Harry tries to help his sister to only be forced to watch.

Days of starvation and dehydration, the twins could barely move from their spot with their eyes open when the cupboard door opened. Flinching at the sound, they pulled themselves up to huddle into the corner of the already cramped space. Squinting at the harsh light pouring into their dark cupboard, they came to face Petunia. With much displeasure seen on her face, she threw a single water bottle and a stale bread slice. Slamming the door shut and locking it, the twins waited until Petunia disappeared into the kitchen. 

Staring at the bottle of water and stale bread, their faces brightened. Harry grasped onto the bread and smiled whilst ripping it in half. 


'It's a whole piece of bread-!'



'She only gives us half... Oh! It's still a little soft in the middle!' 


Smiling amongst themselves, they nibbled on the bread and took turns sharing the bottle of water, making sure to reserve half of the bottle for emergencies. 


'It's better than what we had last week.'


'I'm still hungry...' Rose tried ignoring the small grumbles coming out of her stomach as Harry held her hand for comfort.


'Me too...'



'I hope we can get another slice of bread for our birthday this year.'



'I really want that chocolate cake that Dudley had for his birthday.'



'With lots of strawberries-!'


Imagining the delicious cake in their minds, they were interrupted by the sudden thumping and dust raining upon them. Their cousin had woken up.

""WAKE UP, POTTERS!!"" Jumping on the stairs a few more times, he ran down the stairs and unlocked the door before moving to the side. 

Seeing the door open, the two crept out of the cupboard to only be pushed back inside by Dudley and slam the door shut again. Laughing at his own joke, he ran into the kitchen as Petunia happily greeted him. 

""Y-You okay, Rose?""

""M' fine..."" Wincing as she got up, she noticed her thigh with a cut. 

""T-That looks bad-!"" Panicking at the cut, Harry tried to wipe away the blood, but Rose winced and whimpered at the pain. As he dabbed at the blood, he noticed a small piece of wood stuck in the cut.

""Wo-Wood.""

""I-It hurts...""

""I'll try to take it out."" Nodding, Harry gently applied pressure around the wound before grabbing the piece of wood. 

""What are you two doing lazing around?!"" Petunia shrieked. 

""Rose has a wood-""

""Vernon and I didn't take you both in to repay us by being such lazy fools! Get up this instant-!"" Harry opened his mouth to retaliate despite knowing he'll be punished, Rose interjected. 

""W-We're sorry, A-Aunt Petunia..."" 

""You're both filthy-! Go out to the backyard this instant! I won't have you both ruin Duddikin's special day out with your dirty appearance."" Walking back into the kitchen with a huff, Harry helped Rose up. 

'Rose, you're hurt-!' She did her best to ignore the pain as she walked to the kitchen, forcing a smile at her brother.

'I don't want Harry to get hurt again because of me.' Unable to answer, he held her hand and guided her whilst trying to be her crutch to ease the pain as much as possible. 

Petunia quietly urged the two to stand by the fence as she got the water hose. Thankfully, it was a warm day today, even if it was slightly chilly due to the early morning. Holding each other's hand, they scrunched their faces in pain as the harsh pressure of the water came in contact. Stopping the water, Petunia pointed at them to turn around. Applying the same pressure again, Rose whimpered as the water was harshly brushing against her wound. Squeezing Harry's hand, he squeezed back. 

Giving them one more spritz, Petunia returned the hose to its place before throwing them a paper towel and not come inside until they were completely dried. Folding the paper towel, Harry wiped away the water on Rose's face before doing the same and placing the damp paper onto the ground for Rose to sit.

""It's okay, Harry-""

""It's bumpy... it'll hurt more if you sit on it..."" Unable to refute, she happily took the thin protection and sat down against the wet fence with Harry. The pain was beginning to throb more as it was getting harder for her to ignore. 

Despite the pain, she was happy to be outside as the day was getting brighter. Harry held onto her hand as they both soaked in the warm sunlight. Not even half an hour passed when Petunia slid the door open with much annoyance plastered on her face. Understanding the cue to come, they walked to the front of the door. 

""Do not move!"" Petunia warned as she disappeared to get something. Still dripping wet, the two looked around until Rose saw the very item she and Harry were thinking about that morning. 

'Harry... look.' Looking in the direction she was, his eyes lit up at sight.


'It's a chocolate cake!'



'With lots of strawberries...'


'It looks delicious.' Loud grumbling erupted from both as they stared at the delicious cake sitting on a crystal cake stand. 

Hearing loud footsteps, they looked away and to the floor as Petunia reappeared with Dudley and Vernon. Dudley smirked as he took a seat in front of them whilst Vernon ignored their presence and read the morning paper. Petunia threw clothes at the twins with a few more sheets of paper towel. 

""Get dressed; we are leaving soon."" 

""Y-Yes, Aunt Petunia...""

The two quietly did as instructed, but Rose had shivers go down her spine when she glanced up to see Vernon staring at her. Immediately looking away, she quickly tried to change her clothes, ignoring her pain whilst Harry was oblivious to their Uncle's gaze on Rose.

Arriving at the zoo, Vernon warned the two in the car to behave and not cause anything. The two nodded as they silently followed the family into the zoo. Despite their rough morning, it was a pleasant day for them. They could go outside, see various animals, and were allowed to share a single ice lolly when the cashier noticed them if they wanted anything. Vernon reluctantly picked the least expensive and shoved it to share, but they were ecstatic for the sweet treat. 

Walking around for a few hours, they finally came to the reptilian sector of the zoo. Seeing the different reptilians, they all came to a stop when Dudley noticed a snake sleeping on a rock. Leaning against the railing, he banged against the glass, demanding the snake to move. Ignored, he asked his father to wake the snake. Knocking on the glass, the snake ignored them again, making Dudley yell at the glass. 

""Move-!!""

""H-He's asleep."" Rose quietly said.

""...He's boring."" Vernon and Petunia tried to cheer him up as they walked away to see another reptile. 

""We're sorry he was so rude..."" Rose apologized to the sleeping snake as Harry read the description to the best of his ability.

""He was bred... cap...capt-tee...""

'Captivity, hatchlingsss.' Startled by the sudden voice in their heads, they turned to see the snake was awake and staring at them.


'Was it you?'



'You can understand me, hatchlingsss?'



'We were thinking the same thing...'



'It's been quite a long time since I've had anyone to talk to.'



'What does it mean to be born in cap...'



'I was born here.'



'You must be lonely...'



'Yesss.'



'We're sorry... we know what that's like.'


'It's quite alright. In fact, I'm happy to talk to you both.' They smiled at the thought that someone was willing and happy to talk to them. That is until Dudley came crashing into them, causing them both to fall to the ground. 

""The snake is awake!"" Leaning against the glass, the twins glared at their cousin as Rose wished he'd fall into the water whilst Harry wished he'd be in the same area as the snake. As if their wish was granted to them, the glass suddenly disappeared, making Dudley fall straight into the water and freeze at the sight of the snake in front of him. The snake slithered around him before hissing at the boy and slithering onto the ground towards the twins. 


""Thanksss.""


""N-no problem..."" Unsure if they were the one to cause the snake its freedom, the snake slithered around them and nuzzled against their neck in thanks before slithering away, causing people to panic and scream of a free snake.

""D-Did we do that...?"" Rose was just unsure as to her brother. The two weren't sure what to make of the situation before quietly giggling amongst themselves until Petunia screamed. They looked up to see Vernon glaring at them as Petunia was banging on the glass for her son as Dudley was doing the same for his mother crying. 

Driven home, Dudley was wrapped in a blanket as he was brought back inside by Petunia. Vernon grabbed the twins by the back of their shirts and demanded to know how they pulled off such a thing. Unsure to say it was them, Vernon was getting more enraged by their muttering and silence. Threatening them with punishment, the two begged for mercy despite knowing it would not affect their Uncle; he demanded an answer. Rose was the first to say the forbidden word, which caused her a slap against the cheek and Harry crying for Rose.

""W-We swear, U-Uncle, w-we don't know what happened. I-it was like magic-""

""THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC! I WON'T HAVE YOU SAYING SUCH VULGAR THINGS IN MY HOUSE!""

""R-Rose!"" Holding her cheek as the tears were threatening to spill, Vernon huffed as Petunia interrupted her husband. 

""Dear, if you harm her so much... they won't like it.""

""... I suppose so."" Staring at the twins, he slammed the door shut. ""I'll deal with you two later."" Locking the door, he stormed off to the kitchen to comfort his wailing son. 

""R-Rose... I-It's bleeding again."" Seeing the poorly wrapped wound with paper towels, Rose hid it under her hand with a pained smile. 

""M...M' okay.""  

 

~~

~~

 

That evening, they were awoken by laughter in the kitchen. Harry was the first to wake up to the noise and peer through the small opening in the door. Listening to the laughter, it sounded like Mr. Dursley had guests over again, his co-workers most likely. As things were rowdy in the kitchen, he noticed Petunia appearing in front of the door. Harry flinched away and scooted back to Rose. 

Petunia opened the door as she gripped Rose's leg to shake her awake. Jolting awake, Rose looked around confused until she saw Petuina's expression. 

""Hurry out, the both of you."" Opening the door, Harry and Rose looked at one another, confused as Petunia never shakes them to wake up nor quietly urges them to follow her.


'Are we in trouble...?'



'I don't know, but they have guests in the kitchen...'


Closing their cupboard door, they followed Petunia into the kitchen to see two men and a woman seated in the dining area with Vernon. Ushering them towards the island, Petunia handed Harry a stack of new plates and whispered not to embarrass them tonight while she handed Rose a closed serving dish. 

""Give it to your Uncle and stay behind him.""

""Y-yes, Aunt Petunia..."" Doing as instructed, she saw Harry was waiting for her behind Vernon. Scurrying to her spot, Petunia served the last of the dish before telling everyone to dig in. 

""My goodness, Petunia, you've outdone yourself.""

""Oh, it's nothing but a humble dinner, I must say."" Petunia shyly answered back as the men chuckled. 

""Not at all, if only my wife as good as a cook as you.""

""You flatter me, sir.""

""You got a good one, Vernon.""

""Yes, sir, I do."" Vernon replied, smiling.

""What of the little ones?""

""Oh, they've already had their fill. They're here to help serve, they insisted."" Petunia quickly said.

""My, I wish my children were as considerate as yours.""

""Niece and nephew, actually... my wife's sisters.""

""Goodness.""

""I'm afraid they have their father's looks."" 

""Well, now that you mention it, they look quite similar in a way...""

""Fraternal twins.""

""I'm not sure about the boy, but the girl..."" The man closest to Rose raised his hand, startling the girl; she flinched. The man hooked his hand under her chin and smiled as he inspected her. ""She may be young, but I must say, she is quite a fine specimen as you promised...""

Vernon smiled as Petunia sighed in relief as the other two adults laughed at the man's comment. The woman raised her fork as she teased the man beside her staring at Rose.

""Now, John. Don't frighten the poor thing before you had your way; you wouldn't want her to be so nervous.""

""I was merely seeing what I was paying for.""

""Goodness, here I thought you'd take them both. They're much too young for my taste.""

""You aren't the only one with standards, Stephen."" The table erupted with laughter as they continued with their meal and ignored the twins behind Vernon.

'Rose... are you alright?' Harry glanced to Rose to she was shaking with tears threatening to spill. 


'W-What does he m-mean...? Have his way w-with me?'


'I-I... I don't know...' As clueless as they were, they had a horrible feeling about it. 

After dinner, Harry and Rose helped clear the table as Petunia brought out tea and a new set of plates and forks. Rose couldn't stop shaking as she felt the stares of the two men and Vernon on her. Ignoring them to the best of her ability, she walked to the sink and helped Harry clean the dishes. 

""Now, then, John. I do believe you owe what is due. I have held my end of the promise.""

""I do believe you did. The amount we discussed?"" The man took out his wallet and began taking out money onto the table. 

""It was a lovely dinner, Petunia, but I'm afraid Stephen and I are needed back home.""

""Oh, already? I had made a chocolate cake for you.""

""Tempting, but I'm afraid I must pass.""

""Oh very well, perhaps next time.""

""Very well."" Seeing them out, the two bid farewell to Vernon and John. Rose looked up to see Vernon showing John into the seating area to get more comfortable. 

""ROSE."" Startled to have her name yelled out, she quickly dried her hands and scurried to her Uncle.

""Y-Yes?""

""I'd like you to meet Mr. Atkinson.""

""H-Hello, sir."" Smiling, he held out his hand to Rose. Reluctantly taking it, she held back her fear as he smiled a little wider. 

""You are quite adorable, Rose.""

""...T-Thank you, sir.""

""I'm sure you'll grow to be quite the beauty when you grow up."" Unsure where this was going, Vernon spoke. 

""You will be going with Mr. Atkinson for a few nights.""

""F-Few nights?"" 

""Yes, my dear."" Not liking what was happening, she stared at the man with wide-eyes. Chuckling, he smiled, ""It'll only be a few nights, and I promise it'll be quite wonderful for us both."" Slightly gripping onto her hand, she flinched and felt sick to the stomach.

""U-Uncle V-Vernon, p-please-""

""Don't be so rude!"" 

""Now, Vernon. There is no need to be so serious. She is bound to be nervous. I am her new owner for the next few days."" The two began talking as Rose wanted to get away from the man. Wishing nothing but for the man to let her go and disappear, she didn't realize she was causing the lights to flicker around the house. 

""Seems like you need to fix your lights.""

""Yes, i-!"" Vernon froze as he saw what was behind John. It was the chocolate cake on the crystal cake stand. 

""Are you alright, Vernon?""

""Y-yes, I am just alright..."" Worriedly starring at the cake, John raised a brow, confused until he felt a harsh thud on the back of his head. Letting go of Rose, he groaned in pain. Rose ran to the corner of the room.

""What is the meaning of this?!"" Standing to his feet, he yelled at Vernon, outraged.

""I assure you, this is just a misunderstanding-""

""TO TRY AND ROB ME BLIND!? WAS THAT YOUR PLAN?!""

""Absolutely not-!"" 

""Dear, I heard, oh goodness-!! Are you alright, Mr. Atkinson?!""

""Enough of this-! I'll take my business elsewhere-! Somewhere I won't try and be killed!"" Storming off with a cake-stained suit and a throbbing head, he slammed the door open and close.

Left alone, Vernon glared at Rose before grasping onto her hair and dragging her to the kitchen. Begging for mercy as she tried prying his meaty fingers out of her hair, Vernon threw her against the chairs and grabbed the nearest item, fire poker, and began beating her. Crying in pain as he hit her, he yelled about how she ruined his chance of making a lot of money and having to be such a freak causing such problems. Petunia sighed and rubbed her temples before stopping Harry from running to Rose. 

Pulling the crying boy to the cupboard, she locked him inside without a word and continued to wash the remaining dishes whilst listening to the cries and yelling of her husband.

""Dearie, do try and keep your voice down; you will wake up Dudley."" 

""THIS WRETCHED, SELFISH PIECE OF GARBAGE!"" Throwing the fire-poker to the side, he huffed, trying to catch his breath. Rose laid limp on the ground as she could barely move her fingers. Whispering apologies, she squeaked when Vernon dragged the girl to the cupboard. 

""YOU BEST KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN OR I'LL BE DOING THE SAME TO YOU AS WELL."" Vernon warned Harry. 

Throwing her into the cupboard, he went off into the living room as Petunia tried calming down her enraged husband. 

""We can always find other people, dearie.""

Calming her husband, he sighed as he thanked Petunia for being such a caring wife; she smiled. Apologizing about the mess, Petunia shakes her head and gets to cleaning up the mess whilst Vernon goes upstairs to get ready for bed. After an hour of cleaning, Petunia rolled up the blood-stained rug and the cushion cases into the hamper, leaving it for another day. Turning off the lights, she went upstairs to join Vernon for bed. 

Harry was in tears as he tried to wake his sister. The blood was everywhere and didn't seem to disappear no matter how much he tried to wipe it away. Gently shaking Rose, he continued to call her name until she let out a pained whimper. 


'R-Rose! C-Can you stand?'



'I-It hurts... i-it hurts...'


Unsure what to do, Harry tried to wipe away the blood as he took out the few pieces of bandages he was able to sneak earlier when Petunia and Vernon weren't looking. Covering up the biggest of the wounds with the flimsy bandage, his tears wouldn't stop as he could hear his sister's pained cries in his mind. 


'S-Someone... please...'

""Why must I be the one to do such a meaningless task?""

""Because I can trust you with such task, my boy.""

""Could you not ask Hagrid?""

""I'm afraid Hagrid is occupied with a favor I had asked.""

""I have lesson plans to make and papers to grade, Headmaster... I am not a house-elf.""

""Please do me this favor, my boy. I'm sure you would like to get a bit of fresh air while you are out. Oh, I do remember you saying you required a few ingredients for your potions. Aren't they sold in the muggle world?""

""... I shall do this once. I am far too busy to be told such meaningless tasks.""

""Thank you, my boy, Severus.""

""Hmpf."" 

 

I shall dig my grave now... ;;w;;

meanwhile, Vernon can go to hell

Listening to Harry's cries for Rose has been irritating Vernon and Petunia.Rose is injured and growing with a fever much to The Dursley's pleasure, they decide to get rid of Rose- One mouth less to feed and care for.

Harry was locked in the cupboard with his sister. It was nothing new, but Rose was in no condition sleeping in a cupboard, not with her injuries and now growing fever. Harry begged for Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia, but like always, they ignored the boy's pleas as if he had not existed. Days have passed; every day, Harry begged for his Uncle or Aunt to help Rose. Medicine, water, or a simple cold-soaked towel, he asked for just one thing every day but was met with silence. 

Every day, Rose was growing warmer to the touch and breathing a little heavier than the next. Coming in and out of consciousness, Rose would see a blurry image of Harry worrying over her. And every time, she only gave him a pained smile, ensuring she'll be fine. They both knew she wouldn't be. 

""Vernon... Shouldn't we give her something at the very least?""

""Don't tell me you are caring for that brat?""

""Of course not-! I do not want a dead child in my house!"" 

""He has been getting irritating the past few days."" Grumbling as he folded his paper, Petunia muttered under her breath, worrying about Dudley getting sick because of the freak's dirtiness. Hearing Petunia mumbling about Dudley gave Vernon an idea.

""Petunia, dear.""

""Yes??""

""It would be easier for us to have one mouth less to feed, would it not?""

""Of course! They just barged into our lives with no regard! We've done more than enough for them!"" Grinning, he took a sip from his teacup. 

""It's settled then.""

""But dear, where will we take her??""

""Anywhere near-by will be fine; nobody knows about there being two of them.""

Thinking nothing of it, the two went on with the day without an ounce of remorse for what they were about to do, nor were the twins aware.

That evening, Petunia was in quite a good mood as she hummed a tune whilst fixing supper for her husband and son. Vernon and Dudley were occupied with the telly, laughing to their heart's content until Harry yelled out once more, begging. 

Dudley, growing irritated with Harry's voice, threw his pillow at the door startling Harry. Having listened to Harry's cries the past few days, Dudley begged his father to shut him up, to which Vernon smiled, promising he'll resolve the issue by morning. Only having to endure it tonight, he promised Dudley a trip to the mall for a brand new toy. 

Called by Petunia about supper being ready, the two joined her at the dining table and gorged themselves without a care in the world. 

Harry didn't know what else to do. He wasn't a medic, nor did he have anything else to use to help Rose. This morning, her body had grown warmer, and she was now sweating profusely. She hasn't woken up once since last night. 


'Rose... please wake up... please-!



Don't leave me alone...'


Holding her hand, he laid beside her and began praying to whoever was out there to please help his sister. 

""I am growing tired with his persistent wailing-!"" Petunia shrieked as she put away the dishes. 

""There will be too many eyes outside, dear. Wait a few hours more, and we will have one less issue to deal with.""

""Why did it have to be us to be given those freaks?!""

""They think we are running an orphanage here!"" Vernon agreed. 

""We should've taken them to an orphanage the moment we saw them on our doorstep that night.""

""What were we thinking..."" 

Waiting for the hour to grow later in the night, the neighborhood houses grew dark with only the lamp posts' exception. Checking outside once more, Vernon nodded his head; it was safe to leave the house. Opening the cupboard door slowly, she pulled the feverish girl out of Harry's grasp and wrapped her in a ragged old blanket before handing her to Vernon. They left the house as quietly as possible and began to walk. 

They saw a dense little forest at the end of the street with quite a fair distance from their house. Despite the late hour, the two looked around for anyone before placing the girl down between the bushes. Dusting off the dirt on their hands, they hurried back home until they ran into their neighbor Mrs. Figgs. 

""Is that you, Vernon? Petunia?"" 

""M-Mrs.Figgs, it's quite late in the hour. What are you doing out?""

""I should be asking you both the same.""

""W-Well... Vernon and I... we thought it'd be a good idea to take a walk in the neighborhood-! Yes-! I'm trying to get Vernon to get a little exercise."" Forcing out a small laugh, Vernon stiffly smiled whilst nodding. 

""Quite late for a walk...""

""W-Well... what are you doing out, Mrs. Figgs?"" Quickly trying to change the subject, they're glad when Mrs. Figgs responds. 

""Looking for my cat, Mr.Whiskers. You haven't seen him around, have you?""

""I'm afraid not, Mrs.Figgs."" 

""Oh goodness... I do hope he hasn't gone far...""

""I-it's getting quite late; I do apologize, Mrs. Figgs, b-but we'll be heading inside now.""

""Oh... yes, you do that. Have a good night.""

""Evening, Mrs. Figgs."" Nervously laughing, they quickly walked back to their house as Mrs. Figgs waved, smiling until they were out of her sight. 

Watching them head inside, she continued her walk with her stroller squeaking behind her. Looking around the small bushes to underneath benches, she continued to look until she came to the end of the neighborhood street. Nothing but a small forest and gates leading to the streets, she looked around until she heard a small pained whimper. Walking further into the forest, she saw the ragged cloth and let out a sigh of relief but regretted it when she saw what was underneath it.

""By Merlin's beard...oh dearie..."" Gently pulling the girl into her arms, she looked around before whistling a small tune. 

Walking to the curb, she sat on the bench, waiting until a sudden gust of wind appeared with a purple triple-decker. Coming to a halt in front of Mrs.Figgs, a man stepped out of the entryway with a card in hand and began reading-

""Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand hand, step on board, and we can take you anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this evening.""

""Stan.""

""If it isn't my favorite squib, Mrs. Figgs. How can I be of service?"" 

""I cannot leave my post until I know that Harry Potter is safe. I need you to take Rose Potter to the Leaky Cauldron and-""

""Oh... Mrs. Squibbs, I may like you but to ask me to deliver is...""

""I promise to pay, of course.""

""... You know I do not like getting into other's business.""

""I do; I only ask you to take the girl to the Leaky Cauldron and ask the owner to send word to Dumbledore.""

""I don't know...""

""How does one Galleon sound?""

""Very well!"" 

""Please do be careful with her, dear.""

""We're always careful here."" The conductor smiled as he walked into the bus, stating their location, and the Knight Bus was gone. 

Looking around once more, Mrs. Figgs quietly returned home. 

 

~~

~~

 

Arrived at the Leaky Cauldron, Stan walked inside, trying his best not to jostle the girl awake despite not realizing how ill she was. Many were surprised to see the well-known conductor step foot outside the bus as he walked over to the bar to talk to the owner. Seeing the small body in his arms, they thought nothing of it until one of the patrons beside him saw the child's face and a scar under the mess of hair. 

""Bless my soul; it's one of the Potter twins!"" 

The dining room went silent as patrons all hovered around the bar to look at the famous Potter. Seeing the child in front of them, they all began to whisper, wondering why one of the famous Potters was looking the way she was. The noise grew as every patron looking at the sick child began speculating. 

Unknowingly, one of the patrons residing in the Leaky Cauldron was non-other than Hogwarts Potions Professor. Earlier that day, Severus had done the meaningless task he was given by Dumbledore and bought the necessary ingredients he needed. Having the rest of the day to himself, he thought it best to take a rest at The Leaky Cauldron, seeing as it was the easiest way to go into Diagon Alley. 

Checking his ingredients once more and satisfied he had everything, he went down to the dining area to have a cup and read the Daily Prophet. It was peaceful for a few minutes until it started to get rowdy, much to his pleasure. 

Deciding he had stayed long enough, he paid for his tea and was ready to head through Diagon Alley but heard the one name he somewhat despised. 

""-it's one of the Potter twins!""


'Potter?' 


Glancing over, he saw the small crowd around the bar and scoffed. 'Ever the attention- seeker. Just like his father.'

Having nothing to do with Potter, he turned away but heard the whispers and murmurs, grabbing his attention and remembering that Lily and James had twins. 

""Wasn't she be being raised by her relatives?""

""She is littered with cuts and bruises-!""

""Do you think...""

""Of course not, Dumbledore, himself assured they were doing quite well with their relatives-""


'Relatives? Potter was an only child, and Lily had... oh no. Oh, don't tell me that...'


Pushing through the crowd, Severus' eyes widened at the sight of the child. 

""Rose..."" 

I don't know the proper way for squibs to be able to call for the Knight Bus, so forgive me for making it up you hardcore fans ;;w;;

Thank you for the kudos so far! I'm actually really surprised I got any XD

Seeing the severity of Rose's injuries, Severus takes her home with him and calls for Poppy. 

Harry wakes up in shock that his twin sister has disappeared. 

Sirius wants his godson and goddaughter back.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The night James and Lily Potter were killed, Severus Snape had gone to see the crime scene and was heartbroken to see the love of his life lifeless on the ground. With two tots crying for their deceased mother, Snape cradled Lily's body as he cried his heart out.

Watching Lily's body be taken away from his arms and onto a gurney, he felt as if a piece of him has died alongside her. Standing up to follow the body, the small cries made him glance behind to remember who Lily died trying to save. Staring at the two toddlers, he could immediately see James in the both of them. Merely, thinking about James made his gut wretch as he had taken the one thing he dearly loved both in life and death. But seeing their eyes, he clearly saw they were Lily's eyes. 

The bright green eyes that he so loved. 


'Lily... I'm sorry I couldn't apologize to you before...'


Thinking about how their friendship fell apart, Severus couldn't help but feel the wave of emotions hit him again. Silently tearing up and clutching onto the side of the crib, he wondered how he let it get worse as the years went on. 


'Lily...' 


Unsure of what to do now that she was gone, he contemplated if it was worth living until he felt a small tug on his finger. 

""Ma... Ma. Dada-! Pafoo...!!""

""Moo-ey... Ma-!"" Raising their hands to Severus, he pulled them into his arms. It was that moment he remembered Lily begging him to protect her children if anything happened to her or James. At first, he refused, not wanting to do anything with Potter, but seeing the desperation and the guilt he had towards Lily- he agreed. He didn't think it'd be so soon. 


'I promise Lily... 



 I promise.' 


 

Even if he was a little late on his promise, he wasn't one to go back on his word. 

 

~~

~~

 

Bringing Rose home with him, he quickly went to work to clean the major wounds. Seeing her body littered with them under older scars put a bad taste in Severus' mouth. Flicking out his wand, he had multiple spells working her whilst quickly looking through his potions. A green fire roared from the cold hearth as a familiar woman came rushing out of it.

""Where is she!?""

""Wonderful timing as always, Madame Pomfrey. I apologize for calling you so late in the evening.""

""Nonsense! I'm quite glad you called- oh my heavens!!"" Seeing the girl, Pomfrey felt her heart crumble. ""Where did you find her?""

""She was brought into The Leaky Cauldron.""

""By stars, it is a good thing you were there.""

""Likewise.""

""I'll change her into something cleaner."" With a flick with her wand, the rags Rose was wearing had changed into a clean shirt dress. 

It wasn't Pomfrey's first case in a situation like this, but no matter how many times she had seen it, she will never understand how anyone would willingly bring harm to a child. 

With Pomfrey's expertise and Snape's quick work, they were able to bring Rose's temperature down a bit and breathe a little easier.

""She'll need plenty of uninterrupted rest, and she'll need to drink these when she wakes up.""

""I'll keep an eye on her.""

""Who would cause such harm to this poor child...?""

""...I may have an idea of who.""

""I do hope you give them what they deserve."" 

""I may disappoint you."" 

 

~~

~~

 

It was cold. Harry woke up alone and cold in the cupboard. 

Looking around, thinking it was a dream whispered out for his sister but to be met with silence. Reaching for the cupboard door, he peeked through to see if she was doing any chores but saw nobody around. 


'W-Where is Rose...?'


Wondering where she disappeared to, he heard the front door open. Vernon and Petunia rushed inside, closed the door as quietly as possible before letting out a sigh of relief. 

""It's a relief we only came across Mrs. Figgs and not any other neighbor.""

""I'd say it was a great luck for us; that old woman can't tell the difference between her cat and a child."" 

""Well, what's done is done.""

""Good riddance, we have one mouth less to feed.""

""U-Uncle V-Vernon...? A-Aunt Petunia? W-Where is Rose?""

""You won't be seeing that freak of a sister anymore. Best you forget about her from now on.""

""W-What?""

""It's bad enough we had two freaks in this house; consider yourself lucky to have more space to yourself now."" 


'N-No-! R-Rose, please don't take her away from me-!'


""A-Aunt Petunia, no, please-! W-We'll be good, I-I promise I won't cause you any trouble s-so please-! Please give back, Rose!""

""Enough with your whining! Dudley will wake up!"" Petunia sternly spoke as she slammed her hand against the cupboard door.

""U-uncle Vernon-!""

""You best shut your trap, boy, or you'll end up just like that freak of a sister of yours."" Pulling away from the door, Vernon happily walked away as Harry wept for his sister.


'N-No... I don't want to be alone. R-Rose... we promised-! N-No...'


 

~~

Much to Pomfrey's reassurance that Rose was getting better as days passed, Severus wasn't all that convinced despite knowing Pomfrey to be one of the best healers around. She wasn't one to sugarcoat when it came to her patients. 

Despite haven taken the Pepperup Potion for her fever, it wasn't showing immediate results as it would. In fact, Rose's complexion has grown paler and breathing heavier, making Severus anxious about the Potion's capability. But his worries were laid to rest after the very next day when he checked up on the young Potter to see her breathing at a more steady pace, and her fever had gone down. 

Giving her a check-up, Pomfrey face grew more and more infuriated as the list for the child's injuries, and medical history seemed never to end; words continued to flow onto the enchanted parchment with no intention to end anytime soon. It was much too long for someone for her age. Severus' doubts were true as the evidence was clear on the child's body. 

""-I ought to pull his beard clean off as I give a piece of my mind-!!"" 

Severus was furious, yes. But beyond anything, he felt guilty. 

If it was this terrible for this child to think how horrible the other... it was difficult even to imagine. 

""Poppy? Are you here? I've got your message-"" Another guest had stepped through Severus' hearth. 

""Headmistress McGonagall."" With a curd greeting, she stared at Severus in shock and at Pomfrey as if she was dreaming. 

""I-Is that...?""

""Rose Potter.""

""Oh... oh my word. The poor thing... oh what would Lily say...?"" The headmistress let out a shaky breath as she stared at the sleeping child with much sadness. 

Telling McGonagall of what they knew, she was next to direct her fury to the Headmaster. 

""I told him that those muggles were terrible-! I have insisted many times we take them in at the very least, but he-!"" 

""So you were aware of them being in the Dursley's care?""

""Dumbledore assured me that they were being loved and cared for. He had even told me that he asked a friend to keep an eye on them. I-I shouldn't have believed him so easily..."" 

""We are guilty of not noticing it sooner."" 

""I do believe it's time I had a word with the headmaster."" 

""I have a few words of my own."" 

""Madame Pomfrey, would you please-""

""I'll be watching over her, don't you worry. You both do what you must."" 

Stepping into the hearth, they were engulfed in green flames and appeared in front of a familiar face. 

""Minerva, I was wondering where you had disappeared to- Oh Severus, my boy. Do come in, care for a lemon drop?"" 

""Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, you best explain why you have been lying to Severus and me!"" 

""I do beg your pardon?""

""Don't you get all innocent with me!"" 

""Minerva, do try and explain without yelling-""

""I HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE YELLING AT YOU!!""

""Severus, my boy-""

""Why did you place Harry and Rose Potter under the care of the Dursleys, of all muggles?!"" Severus was in no mood to be polite. 

""They are their only blood-relatives-""

""UTTER POPPYCOCK!""

""You, of all people, should know what Lily's sister was like. She's even explicitly stated numerous times how she would not like her children to go anywhere near her should anything happen to her!!""

""Yes, I remember, but I do believe people can change under the right circumstances. In which, the circumstances were relevant.""

""Circumstances?! Petunia hated anything and everything about magic; she made Lily's life utterly miserable every chance she had!""

""It was necessary for the blood wards-""

""No. No, those blood wards would have been utterly useless for those two. Not in the environment they were forced to grow up in."" 

As Dumbledore continued to try and explain himself, McGonagall and Snape weren't having it. Nor was the two people who barged into the office.

""DUMBLEDORE, WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY GODSON AND GODDAUGHTER?!!""

""Sirius, my boy-!"" Surprised to see him, Sirius stormed towards the headmaster snarling. 

""Of all people-! You-! How could you?!"" 

Sirius wanted nothing more than to knock- the so-called warm smile- off the headmaster's face, but Remus was quick to pull him away before he did anything. Smiling at McGonagall and Severus, the two were still shocked to see Sirius in front of them. 

""He was released a few weeks ago and recovering at St Mungo's."" Remus was quick to explain as McGonagall sighed in relief. 

""There was mention about your release and innocence; I hadn't realized it'd be so soon.""

""Why? Miss me Sinvellus?"" Sirius sneered. 

""Not the slightest, you fleabag.""

""Ahem."" McGonagall was quick to stop them.  

""So where are Harry and Rose?"" Sirius asked. 

""At the moment, I only have Rose in my care, as for Harry... I believe he is still the Dursleys.""

""If you were able to save one of them, why didn't you save both?!""

""Sirius."" McGonagall was quick to defend Severus. ""Severus found Rose. She was brought into the Leaky Cauldron; he just happened to be there.""

""It'll do you some good if you listened before you were quick to judge, Black. But that was never your strong point, was it?"" 

""Enough, the both of you. Severus, please. Let us see Rose.""

""...Very well. I take it; you will be fine, Headmistress?"" 

""Very."" Glaring at the Headmaster, Snape flooed back home as Sirius and Remus followed suit. 

 

~~

~~

 

""Hurry with our breakfast, boy-!""

""Y-Yes, Uncle Vernon.""

""He's so slow-!! Mummy!! Make him go faster!!""

It's only been a few days since Rose was thrown away, but it felt like an eternity for Harry. Ever since he can remember, they were together- they only had each other. Nobody else wanted them; that's why they were alone. Rose was always able to make Harry smile despite their situation- she was always so optimistic, Harry didn't know how, but he was grateful for it. 

Harry had cried the first night she was gone, and Vernon had heard him. He forced himself to keep quiet after a few lashes to the back with the belt.  

That following morning, Petunia had caught him dazed whilst staring at the roses in the Garden; Petunia smacked him across the face for being a sloth and threw him into his cupboard to starve for the next few days. 

""You lazy mongrel! You've burned Duddikins breakfast!!"" 

""I-I'm sorry, A-Aunt Petunia. I-I'll re-"" Grabbing Harry's hand, she placed it onto the searing hot pan. Screaming in pain, she let his hand go, and he fell onto the floor. 

""Mummy-!! I'm starving!!""

""I'm sorry, my Duddikins. I'll remake your breakfast now, be patient?""

""That freak is making me starve!!!"" 

""And that freak should learn his lesson."" 

""I-I'm s-sorry- AH!"" Vernon wasted no time beating Harry. Petunia, as always, ignored it as she smiled at her son, promising to make his favorite whilst he wailed for food. 

Harry doesn't know when he was thrown back into his cupboard, but he felt numb despite the pain earlier. It was funny how the cupboard he and Rose despised- their cage- was also their haven. So many years, they've spent here crying and wishing for someone to save them. But all he wanted at this moment was nothing more than his sister to be with him. 

Everything was becoming blurry. He knew he shouldn't, but he was just too tired...


'It'll be okay if I sleep for a little bit... maybe I can see Rose...



Maybe... this is all just a bad dream...



I'll see Rose next to me when I wake up...



She'll be next to me...



She will...



She promised.



We promised we'd be together... always...'


 

 

I'm gonna just cry myself a river for making Harry so lonely... I'm sorry, sweetie-!!

After so many years, Sirius and Remus are finally able to see Rose again but are shocked to see Rose frightened of them.To both the marauders' surprise, Severus is able to calm her down. 

Waking up at a strange place with strangers, Rose fears the worse but oddly feels she's met them before...

The three men learn just a glimpse of what she's been through. It's not easy, but they take it slow and with pancakes...

She was alone.

The first thing Rose saw was that she was alone. She had opened her eyes expecting to see Harry next to her in their dark, cramped cupboard but was staring at a high ceiling and was in a soft bed. Glancing around, it was a room she's never seen before, nor does she remember how she got here until Vernon flashed into her mind making her sit up immediately. Ignoring the slight throb in her head and the cold, she quickly slid off the high bed. 

Shivering, she glanced at the blanket on the bed but chose to ignore it. She didn't want to anger her new 'owner' any more than she had with Vernon. He must've managed to convince the man to take Rose- she wasn't going to see Harry again. Holding back her tears, she stretched for the door and slid out. 

Pulling the door close, she heard music being played downstairs- it must be her new owner... 

Quietly following the soft tune, she walked through the long hallway and noticed many pictures framed on the wall, but some of them were covered. Deciding best not to be nosy, she went down the stairs and peeked to see a sitting area but no one around. The music was only a recording being played. 

At the bottom of the stairs, she wasn't sure what she should do. She didn't want to touch anything nor do anything her owner may not like. Best to wait, she sat at the bottom of the stairs shivering for her owner to return. 

Of course, she wasn't expecting people to suddenly walk out of the hearth and a woman rushing down the stairs yelling for Rose. 

She had messed up already...

 

~~

~~

 

""Do try to keep quiet unless you'd like to wake her up, mutt.""

""I swear, Snivellus-""

""Sirius, stop it,"" Remus warned. Sirius was quick to growl at the Potions professor; Severus fought the urge to roll his eyes. 

""She's been asleep for a few days-""

""My stars-! Miss.Potter, you shouldn't be out of bed!"" Hearing Poppy's voice, they turned around to see a shivering girl staring at them with wide eyes. 

""Oh..."" Sirius was taken back seeing her. ""Oh, Rose..."" 

""Potter, why are you out of bed-"" Worried about the child, Severus walked towards Rose to only see the girl in tears. Raising her hands in defense, she wailed out apologies. 

""I-I'm s-sorry-! I didn't m-mean to cause any trouble-!! I-I'm v-very sorry!!"" 

""Po- Rose-""

""I-I'm sorry-! I-I'm sorry... S-So p-please don't h-hurt me, p-please..."" 

Rage boiled inside of Sirius as he saw his goddaughter shaking and cowering in fear from them. Just how much pain did those blasted muggles cause to her, and how much worse is it for Harry right now? If James and Lily saw their daughter, they'd be just as furious and weep, perhaps Lily more. He never should've trusted the damn headmaster- if only he hadn't gone after Peter that day...

""Rose-"" Sirius tried getting closer, but the fear in her eyes made it difficult for Sirius to move. Remus held out his hands, trying to indicate he meant no harm and was able to get closer, but the girl continued to flinch the closer they got. Deciding to try a different tactic, they were beaten to it by Severus as he approached her with much caution, much like a frightened animal. 

""Rose. I apologize; you must've been terrified waking up in a foreign place.

I had brought you here because you were very sick. Madame- Poppy, over there, helped you. She was just concerned about you, as are we."" 

Hearing a soft yet gentle tone, Rose lowered her arms and stared at the man in shock. Nobody had ever spoken to her in such a manner nor tried to help her. She wasn't sure how to react, but she felt the man was sincere, which overwhelmed her. When was the last time anyone spoke to her in such a way- did anyone ever?

Opening her mouth, she felt the urge to thank and apologize for causing him such an inconvenience, but no words escaped. All she could do was let the tears flow once more.

In slow and steady movements, Severus kneeled in front of her and took out a handkerchief to wipe away her tears with a sad smile. 

""You're safe. No harm will come to you.""

It was a simple gesture and a few words, but it meant all the world to Rose.

""T-Thank you..."" 

 

~~

~~

 

""How do you feel, dear?"" 

""A-Alright, miss...""

""No headaches?""

""... I-I'm alright."" 

Sighing, she gently held Roses' hands, ""You needn't lie to me, dear. I only want to help.""

""... M-My head hurts a little a-and I'm a little cold."" Smiling, she thanked Rose for her honesty and wrapped a blanket around her. ""I-It's okay miss, I d-don't need-""

""We mustn't let your fever come back.""

""But... you shouldn't u-use s-such a nice thing on a freak like me...""

""..."" Poppy wasn't sure whether to cry for the child or go after the muggle who had made this child think a blanket is such a luxury she shouldn't be allowed to have. Opting not to scare the girl, she sadly smiled and wrapped her up once more. 

""Would you do me a favor and keep it on you? I'd be delighted if you'd be all bundled up.""

""...Y-Yes ma'am."" 

""Now then, I do believe sleeping for a few days has worked up an appetite. Shall we join everyone downstairs?""

Despite the tall man in the dark robes saying she won't be hurt, she still didn't want to risk enraging the man nor his friends. She couldn't bring herself to be completely relaxed nor trust them, but it was odd. The long-haired man and the man with a scar by his cheek- they seemed quite familiar even though she's only just met them...

""I must return to Hogwarts, Severus."" 

""Thank you for your help Madame Pomfrey.""

""I'm glad you called for me. I trust you can handle things?""

""Yes. I shall see you back at Hogwarts."" 

""Lovely seeing you both and Sirius; I'm glad you are out.""

""Thank you, Poppy.""

""Thank you truly."" 

""It's my job."" Smiling, she gently led Rose to a chair across from Sirius and Remus. ""I'll come back again to check up on you, dear. In the meantime, do take care.""

""...T-Thank you miss-""

""You can call me just, Poppy, dear.""

""Poppy... thank you."" Bidding them all farewell, she disappeared into the sitting room, and with the sight of green flames illuminating the room, she was gone. 

""It's quite early in the morning, but I'm sure you are starving."" Severus said.

""Is there anything you want to eat?"" Sirius asked. 

Startled by the question, Rose held the edge of the blanket and hesitated to answer. Was it a trick? Were they being nice now but going to show their true colors if she made a mistake or misspoke? It wouldn't be the first time. It was best to ask for what Petunia always gave her and Harry- Petunia always reprimanded her if she asked for more food, saying it wasn't lady-like, nor was it good for someone like her to get greedy and fat. 

""J-Just a slice o-of bread will b-be fine... i-it's okay i-if it's a little hard...""

Did they hear her right? A slice of bread? And a stale one, at that-! Remus was never one for conflict, he was always the pacifist of the Marauders, but at the moment- he wanted nothing more than to pay back twice, no ten times the pain they've caused on Rose onto them. Perhaps the Unforgivable Curses, an exception can be made for horrid people like them, no? To feed a growing child a mere slice of bread?! 

""Perhaps something more filling than a slice of bread, hm?"" Remus worriedly stared at Rose, seeing her fidget in her seat.

""U-Uhm..."" 

Glancing up to see them all looking at her with an expression she's never seen before- it's made her all the more nervous. Were they mad? No, if they were mad, she'd clearly know. They didn't seem upset with her nor annoyed; she didn't know how to word it.

A word popped into her head, the tall man with dark robes had said it before-

Concerned. 

They were concerned.

Was it a bad thing? Will she be hit? She didn't know. 

Worrying about the possible punishments, she snapped out of her thoughts when she heard the chair across from her squeak. Looking up, the long-haired man smiled, 

""How about pancakes? I used to make them all the time for Lily; she'd always have it with lots of syrup and butter.""

Lily. That was mom's name. She heard Petunia say it a few times, but she was always mad when she spoke about her. Saying she was the same as her, a freak with the same atrocious hair color. She always made Rose dye it black saying it wasn't pleasant to look at. 

""Y-You knew m-mother?"" Unconsciously pulling the ends of her hair, she asked hesitantly. 

Sadly smiling, he nodded. ""We did."" Rose noticed the man with the dark robes looking sadder than the rest. 

""I have tons of stories about Lily and James. Would you like to hear them?"" Remus volunteered. 

Rose face lit up at the mention of her parents. Nobody knew them, or rather nobody spoke about them, so she and Harry never knew much about them. Only that they were freaks like them and died in a car crash- at least that's what Petunia said, and never wanted to hear them mention it again. 

To hear about her parents, from someone who knew them- she was beyond grateful.

Sirius and Severus went into the kitchen to prepare breakfast while Remus began to tell stories about James and Lily. Every once in a while, Sirius would glance back to see the small spark of curiosity in Rose's eyes and a shy smile when Remus spoke of hilarious moments.  

""I'm glad Rose is here, but... Harry needs to be here too."" 

""... Do you think he'll be in that house?""

""He must be.""

""... I'll stay with Rose, take Lupin with you.""

""Can I just say, it's completely bizarre to see so nice?"" Scowling at Severus, he let out a sarcastic chuckle.

""It wasn't for you.""

""...Why are you doing this? I know you and Lily were... but you hated James. Granted, he was a little harsh to you, but you even yelled at Lily, saying you didn't want anything to do with the both of them.""

Pausing his movement, he stared at the stove and deeply sighed. ""Because I promised her.""

""... Do you intend on keeping it? I don't want you to be a part of their lives if you plan on-""

""I'm a man of my word and... for Lily... it's my way to make peace.""

""... Alright then."" It was an awkward silence between the two but hearing the soft giggles in the dining room had them both glancing at Rose, filling them with determination. 

She and Harry deserved better. Much better. And they're going to give it to them no matter what. 

 

~~

~~

 

Rose stared at the large stack of pancakes in front of her. Was all this for her? Perhaps they were testing her. Dudley had once pretended to share his cake with Rose, but the moment she reached for a small bite, Petunia had screamed at her for trying to poison her son's dessert as Dudley laughed, saying she was an idiot for believing he'd ever share with someone like her. She was told she was a greedy thief and should be punished with several hits onto her palms using the belt. 

Staring at the delicious treat, she hesitated. Going back and forth of reaching towards the plate but to deny herself of it. 

Remus and Sirius glanced at one another, concerned as Severus was just as worried, although he didn't let it show on his face. After several minutes of tug-a-war, Severus gently pushed the plate towards Rose and cut pieces for her. 

""It would be a waste to let such a dish be thrown out. Perhaps you can help and eat it?"" Holding out a fork to her, she hesitated again. 

""...I-Is it really alright of me to have such a thing, s-sir? I-I don't mind just looking at it... I-I don't want to poison it by touching it...""

Sirius didn't want to go back to Azkaban, but he really wanted to murder those muggle relatives. 

""I assure you, Po- Rose. You are not poison nor a freak; in fact, you are special. You are a witch."" 

""... B-But witches don't exist. Magic is a bad freaky thing...""

""Not at all, it's quite wonderful. I'm sure you've experienced it yourself.""

""...Y-Yes, sir."" The somber answer left the dining room to grow silent. 

""P-Perhaps I should make English breakfast? Maybe that'll be better-"" 

""N-No s-sir, I-I'm sorry-!"" Worried she made a mistake, she leaped from her chair to fall onto the floor. The three men stood up, panicking as they heard the harsh thud. 

""Pup?!"" Sirius was first to rush over to Rose. Helping her up, he examined her frantically- looking up and down. ""Are you alright? Does it hurt anywhere?! How many fingers am I holding? Do you know your name?!""

""For Merlin's sake-! She's not blind!"" Severus clicked his tongue as Remus came over to see a small scrape on her arm. Gently taking her arm, he asked if she was alright whilst ignoring the bickering men. 

""Are you alright?"" 

""M'f-fine, s-sir. I-I'm sorry... I-I didn't mean to make t-trouble...""

""I'm sure this hurts, love. You needn't hide it."" Encouraging her with a smile, she stared at him, confused. 


He's not yelling at me? He's not going to hit me? 


""...""

""Let's clean this up and patch you up."" Holding out his arms, Rose tilted her head- was he asking her to get the belt? 

Remus stifled a smile as he saw her tilt her head. Her small frame drowning in a large blanket and staring at him with bright green eyes- it was like looking a fawn. Sirius was next to coo at how adorable she looked. Severus was trying not to follow Sirius. 

Rose stopped staring at Remus and began looking around. Thinking she was nervous, Remus continued to wait but was left waiting with his arms open when she scurried away. Glancing back at Sirius and Severus, they were just as puzzled. Hearing her coming back, Remus turned to smile but frowned, seeing what she came back with. 


A fire poker. 


""L-Love, that's very dangerous; you shouldn't be holding that...""

""I-I know, sir... I-I brought it to you... m-my punishment...""

""P-Punishment?"" Remus couldn't believe what he was hearing.

""I-I was bad...""

""N-No, love. No, you didn't do anything.""

""B-But... I-I sat at the table, eat good food a-and was clumsy...""


Oh...



Oh.



OH. THOSE MUGGLES, HOW DARE THEY-!


Taking the fire poker out of her hands, he set it aside and held her shaking hands. ""No, Rose. I only wanted to hold you; I wanted to get your permission. I didn't want to scare you.""

Hold? But she was a freak. Nobody wanted to talk to freak, no less touch one.

""H-Hold me, sir...?""

""We need to clean that scratch."" Looking at the small wound, she shook her head, smiling. 

""M'kay, sir."" 

""Rose."" Severus kneeled beside Remus. ""We only wish to help. Let us help you.""

""... But sir might trick me.""

""That might be true, you have no reason to trust us, but we truly do wish to help.""

""... R-Really? Y-You d-don't want to hurt me?""

""Never.""

""...Okay.""

""Shall we go fix that wound?"" Nodding, she went to Remus and stood there fidgeting. Remus smiled and held out his arms. ""Shall we?""

After a quick clean and bandage, she was set back down in her seat, and Sirius pushed another fresh stack of pancakes in front of her. Severus was quick to cut it up into pieces and pour syrup over it. Hesitantly picking up her fork, she glanced at Severus- nodding as an encouragement, she took a stab at the soft treat and took a bite. Her eyes lit up as the sweet maple, and soft texture overflowed into her mouth. 

Seeing the pure happiness in her eyes made them sadly smile. It wasn't right for a child to be so happy over a single bite of pancakes. If anything, it should've been the norm. 

""Is it alright, pup?"" Nodding frantically, she couldn't stop eating more. 

""Eat slowly, love; nobody will be taking it from you."" Passing the glass of juice, her eyes lit up once more at the orange liquid. 

Glancing at Remus, he smiled. Taking it as a signal that she can have it, she sniffed the liquid and took a sip. It was delicious-!

They have a lot of work to do...

Rose is learning to trust.

Sirius and Remus go off to rescue. 

Severus tries to be a good guardian- even if it's temporary.

Thank you so much for the kudos and the comments- I'm flattered and surprised you guys are liking this so far. I shall continue to do my best, haha.

Apologies for the wordiness in the conversations for this chap.

""All done?"" 

""Y-Yes, sir. T-Thank you, sir...""

With a flick of Severus' wand, the dirty dishes, cups, and silverware floated away into the kitchen. Hearing the faucet run and the dishes brushing, Rose was just amazed at the simple magic. The table was cleaned, and Rose didn't have to lift a finger to help- it was odd but welcoming that she didn't have to take the dishes and worry about causing any damages because of her clumsiness and weak strength. Vernon would always remind her just how much of a weak freak she was. Every chance he had...

She hadn't had that much to eat ever. Filled to the brim, she gave her flat stomach a satisfying soft tap. She really didn't know why they wanted to help her, but she was nonetheless truly thankful. 

Full, warm, and content, she let out a small yawn and rubbed her eyes. 

""I believe it's time you took a nap, love."" 

""M'fine, sir..."" Yawning again, the two Marauders chuckled as Severus smiled. Seeing her trying to fight her drowsiness was quite adorable. 

""Come. You need your sleep."" 

Suddenly lifted into the air, she gripped onto her blanket and yelped. Floating into Severus' arms, she glanced up at the Potions master and fidgeted. Remus had picked her up earlier, and she didn't hate it. She didn't hate being in Severus' arms either, but she still wasn't sure how she should react. Remus had mentioned that she was far too light and small for someone her age- she was shorter than Harry but didn't think much of it. 

Back at the bedroom, she woke up in, he set her on the bed and handed her a small bottle. It was an odd color, and the smell wasn't pleasant either, but she drank it to the last drop. Scrunching her face from the foul aftertaste and bitterness, it washed away when Severus offered her a small yellow sweet.  It was slightly sour but sweet. 

Sherbert Lemon. 

""I apologize; that was the only thing I have."" Shaking her head, she whispered a timid thank you as he took the empty bottle. She's never had sweets before- but today was full of surprises. Surprises... she and Harry were thrown into Dudley's spare room after Vernon caught them for sneaking a single piece of sweet from the sweet jar that Petunia kept on the counter. Vernon had beaten them till they were black and blue, but thankfully for their freakiness, the next day, they were only littered with a few bruises on their stomach. 

Lost in thought, she hadn't realized she was shaking and gripping onto the blanket to the point her knuckles were white. Severus' hands hovered over her snapping her out of her thoughts. 

""You are safe, Rose.""

They were so nice to her. They fed her, clothed her, healed her injuries, and didn't even hurt her, at least not now...

Perhaps, she can ask about Harry. If they got angry, she'll beg them and repay them by working for them for however long they wanted- cleaning, cooking, or even if she were forced to do things she had horrible feelings about, she'd do it. If it meant she could see her twin just once last time. He was all she had.

""... S-Sir?""

""Are you feeling off anywhere?"" Severus asked, worried she was hurting elsewhere. She shook her head and chewed the bottom of her lip whilst wringing the edge of her shirt. 

Seeing her hesitance, he took a seat and smiled, ""You can talk to me, Rose. I only wish to help.""

""... P-Please.""

""??""

""P-Please s-save Harry..."" Seeing the desperation in her eyes, Severus felt an uncomfortable pull in his stomach. A child shouldn't look so desperate asking for help. 

""Rose-""

""I-I'll d-do anything-! I-I promise to be good-! I-I won't ask for anything e-ever, I-I can co-cook, clean, a-and... I-I'll even..."" She couldn't hold back her tears. Remembering the scary man touching her... ""I-I'll b-be a good pet... s-so. So, p-please-""

""Rose Lily Potter."" Flinching, she saw Severus with a stern look. She's made him mad.

""I-I'm sorry, sir-""

""Rose. You needn't beg me to save your brother. 

You needn't do anything for me.""

""S-Sir?"" Confused, he wiped away her tears and sadly smiled. 

""... You must've been very scared. It must've been hard for you and Harry; you've held it together long enough. 

Do not worry. Black and Lupin will bring Harry here, so do not worry and rest.

As we've said before... we only wish to help.""


Relieved. 



Thankful.



Overwhelmed. 


So many emotions flooded into Rose, she could barely keep the tears from escaping. 

""It's okay to cry, Rose. You've held it in long enough."" 

Holding the edge of his robes, she let the waterworks free. Severus caressed her head as he sat silently listening to her cries.

Thinking about the lies Dumbledore had told him about her and Harry being raised spoiled and loved pricked his heart. He should've gone to see them for himself, he should've done something, but he couldn't change the past. As much as he could've drowned in self-pity, he wasn't going to allow himself to stoop so low. Rose was here now; the present and future were more important than focusing on the past. He was a man of his word- he wasn't going to fail Lily a second time. Absolutely not. 

 

~~

~~

 

""Is she asleep?"" 

Glancing behind, Severus saw Sirius and Remus peaking inside. Tucking Rose into the bed, he waved the curtains closed and walked out of the room. 

""She'll be asleep for a few days. I've given her something to help her rest.""

""I heard her crying...""

""... She had begged me to save Potter. She said she'd-"" Severus was much too uncomfortable even mentioning what she'd do. Even if she wasn't sure herself, the way she worded it... it truly left a horrid taste in his mouth, and the anger he's been feeling had grown.  

Sirius and Remus were quick to catch on as Sirius's hand clenched and muttered out curses. 

""When will you be retrieving Potter?"" 

""Harry. And as much as I'd love nothing more than to storm into those wretched-"" Taking a deep breath, he pinched the bridge of his nose. ""McGonagall has told me to wait until tomorrow; she had asked a favor to Amelia Bones. Said she'll have the paperwork by tomorrow evening...""

""Well, Amelia Bones always did have a strong sense of justice. Especially towards children..."" 

""Let's hope she'll be able to deliver sooner... every minute counts.""

""What will you be doing now?"" 

""As much as I'd like to stay, knowing how much you love my company."" Severus sneered at very mention. Remus held back his chuckle. 

""I haven't finished preparing.""

""Preparing?""

""Well, obviously, I'll be taking them home with Remus and me."" 

It was obvious after they save Harry, both he and Rose will be going with Sirius and Remus. They both were and are written as their guardian- per James and Lily's will. Severus was taken back himself; why had he thought otherwise? It was odd...

""Do you think she will be able to adjust? She's been here a few days, and she is still wary; what makes you think that taking her with you will make her any less defensive.""

""You-""

""He's right, Sirius.""

""Really, Remus? Really?"" 

""It's best we ease them into it rather than forcing them to adjust. Doing that will most likely frighten them more and keep their distance. We've just barely got Rose to allow herself to be treated.""

Sighing, Sirius hated to admit it, but Severus was right. Remus also made sense to it. He really hated this. All he wanted to do was spoil Harry and Rose rotten, shower them with so much love that they'll grow tired to Sirius, and run away from him yelling for Remus to save them. He's deprived them of everything for six years just because his anger got the better of him that night- if he hadn't, perhaps Harry and Rose wouldn't have-

Seeing Sirius going back into the rabbit hole of optimism, Remus shook Sirius out of his thoughts. 

""It doesn't mean we can't finish our preparations."" 

""Yes. Yes, you're right. We can finish their rooms and-"" Rambling on everything he can buy and do for the twins, Remus smiled, seeing how happy Sirius was at the mere mention of what he was going to do for them.

""I believe you'll be able to save Harry sooner than you think."" Hearing the fire roar, they turned to see Amelia Bones smiling at them whilst holding up a rolled parchment in hand. 

""I'm sorry to keep you waiting.""

""I had thought you said it'd be done by tomorrow."" 

""Yes, well. I was not too fond of the idea of the children being stuck in those wretched muggles' house any longer. I also was able to give you an extra gift, one I think you'll like."" Unrolling the parchment, Sirius and Remus beamed at the second parchment hiding inside. 

""Thank you. Truly. How can we-"" Stopping the two men, she held up her hand and smiled. 

""Make sure you give them everything they deserve and shower them with love. Enough to make it up for the six years."" Not waiting for their response, she disappeared into the hearth, leaving the three men astonished. 

""Had she always been so cool?"" Sirius asked, grinning. 

""Poppy and I shall be ready when you return."" With that said, Sirius and Remus apparated to 4 Privet Drive.

They were getting Harry Potter.

 

~~

~~

 

""Vernon-! He's burning up-!!"" 

""Leave him be; he'll be fine tomorrow as always. Those freaks always were able to heal themselves."" 

""It's almost been a week. What if he-""

""If he dies, then good riddance to him. It's a pity we couldn't keep the girl, but it's better than us taking her to the hospital-""

""Dear, we need to get rid of him from our house...""

""We'll leave him at the amusement park tomorrow when we go out. We can call the coppers afterward saying he ran away; I doubt they'll look for him.""

""Are you sure?""

""Of course, my love. There is no need to fret-"" Trying to calm his wife that his plan was foolproof, the doorbell rang. ""Tuney, dear, would you get that? Perhaps it's our guests."" 

Happily walking to the front door, she opened it to greet her guests but shrieked, seeing who it was.

""Hello, Tuney~.""

""Y-You-! Get off my property y-you criminal-! We want nothing of your kind here!!"" Slamming the door shut, it was blocked by Sirius as he pushed it wide open. 

Falling to the ground, she quickly scurried to the sitting room as Vernon got up, wondering why his wife was acting so hysterical. As the two men walked inside, Remus quickly searched the house as Sirius stood in front of the two muggles.

""Just who do you think you are?! Get out of my house this instant before I call for the coppers-!!"" Reaching for the phone, Sirius quickly grabbed the man's hand and twisted it, making him wail in pain. Pushing him to Petunia, she panicked over her husband's aching wrist and began yelling at Sirius that he was insane. Coldly glaring at the muggles, he held out his wand, pointing it to them, and saw their fear growing. As much as he'd love to torture them for everything they've done to Harry and Rose, he had only come to rescue Harry and give them a small gift Amelia had mentioned. 

Remus returned downstairs with Dudley running to their parents in tears. Telling Sirius he can't find Harry anywhere, Sirius's fury grew as he leaned down towards them and let his wand illuminate light- of course, they didn't know it was a simple spell for light- Petunia was in tears as Vernon was close to weeping himself. 

""WHERE. IS. MY. GODSON? I WON'T ASK TWICE.""

Unable to answer, they continued to weep and beg for mercy, but Sirius and Remus weren't having it. Remus cast a simple spell, and Petunia's favored china began breaking one by one around them. Screaming, Dudley cried louder as Petunia tried calming her son. Vernon let out a whimper and pointed towards the stairs. As Sirius kept his eye on them, Remus went to check. Looking around, he saw the small cupboard door. Unlocking it, he had to hold back his disgust as the smell of blood and urine flowed out of the cramped space. 

Seeing what they came for, he held back his tears and tenderly pulled the boy into his arms, not caring for the smell nor rags. Calling out to Sirius that he got Harry, Sirius pulled out the parchment and told them to sign along the dotted lines. 

""You will hand over the custody of Harry James and Rose Lily Potter to me. 

Come near them again, and I won't be so merciful."" 

Quickly signing, Sirius placed their gift onto the coffee table before collecting the signed parchment. 


""Why.""


""W-What?""

""Why did you do- no. How could you do this to them? They are your niece and nephew- your sister's children-! Blood relative!

And what you were going to do to Rose-""

""YOU THINK I ASKED FOR THOSE FREAKS?!

THEY CAME INTO OUR LIVES WITHOUT A CARE, AND WE HAD TO PUT UP WITH THEIR FREAKINESS-! ALL FOR NOTHING-! WE SHOULD BE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE GIVEN PITY, NOT THOSE DISGUSTING-""


""I'd be conscientious what you say next, Tuney."" 


""Sirius."" 

""... As much as I'd love to stay and chat, it's time we leave."" Walking out the door, Sirius stopped and glancing back at them. ""I left a gift for you. It's nothing compared to what you did to my pups, but I'll settle with it. Good evening."" 

Closing the door, Petunia shrieked as Vernon got up to find ice for his aching wrist. Dudley was still crying and had wet his pants; Petunia couldn't care at the moment- she has never been so humiliated in her life. She vowed she'll get back at them until she heard Vernon fall to the ground with the 'gift' Sirius left.

""V-Vernon? Dear?""

""...W-We're done for..."" 

""Wha-"" Walking over to her husband, she saw the paper and fell to the ground beside him. Smack in the center of the parchment was a note-

 


Did you think I'd let you get away with harming my pups?



As much as I wish I can give you the pain of what you gave my pups- I won't.



The moment you read this, your life has now ended. 



Tomorrow morning, you'll be taken into custody, and your child will be put into foster care- you will both rot in jail for the rest of your days as your child will never see either one of you ever again.



Did I mention? Inside, they don't take too kindly to those who harm children... I'm sure you'll be having fun inside.



You should've never harmed my pups. 


 

~~

~~

 

Rose had forgotten she wasn't back in her cupboard; she jolted awake as she did every day, remembering the banging of the cupboard door and Petunia's yelling them to wake up as Vernon threatened them with punishment. Still asleep and drenched in a cold sweat, her dream-self covered her ears, still hearing their voices, especially that man who gave Rose the absolute creeps. She continued to shake her head, trying to get rid of the voices and memories, but it continued to grow louder and more vivid. 

Severus came running hearing Rose's screams and immediately woke her up from her nightmares.

""Rose-! Rose, wake up-!"" 

Waking up in tears, she sat up immediately, thinking she was back in the cupboard. ""I-I'm sorry, U-Uncle V-Vernon, I-I'm sorry-""

""Rose. 

Rose. It's alright.

It was a nightmare; you are safe. You aren't back with those people."" Reassuring her that it was only a nightmare, she wept into his arms as he stroked her hair. Severus found it quite odd how he- the infamous cold-hearted bat of a potions professor- can comfort a child, nonetheless, Potter, like it was second nature to him. 

Now calm and sniffling, she pulled away from Severus' arms and apologized. Wiping away her remaining tears, he asked if she was alright, and to his displeasure, she said she was fine. 

""Would you like to talk about it?""

""..."" He took the silence as progress. To the very least, she wasn't immediately rejecting the idea, nor did she flinch when he had embraced her earlier. 

""You needn't tell me anything you aren't comfortable with, Rose."" Gripping onto the covers and biting her lower lip, Severus sadly smiled. ""It's alright, Rose. You needn't force yourself; I'm sorry."" 

""I-I'm sorry...""

""Don't be; I know it's not easy telling others."" It was odd, but Rose felt like he spoke as if he knew how she felt. 

""Sir...? I-Is it true, I-I'm a witch?""

""Yes. All those things that happen around you, whether you do with pure intent or accidentally, it is normal for magic children to use accidental magic.""

""Freaky things was all magic?""

""Yes, but Rose- it was accidental magic. Completely normal to witches such as yourself. It's actually quite amazing what you've told me; you have a great aptitude for magic. It's quite rare for children your age."" 

Praised for her freaky accidents made Rose unknowingly smile. She wasn't weird nor a freak; she was special, just like her parents. She and Harry were special. 

""Is Harry a witch too?"" Chuckling, he shook his head. 

""No, Harry is a wizard.""

""Oh.""

""And speaking of Harry. I'm sure you'll like to know-"" Telling Rose that Harry was here, her eyes immediately lit up. Forgetting she had a nightmare a few minutes ago, she began asking about Harry. Smiling, he stood up and held out his hand, ""Perhaps you'd like to see your brother, yourself?""

Nodding frantically, she held Severus offered hand, and he pulled her into his arms. Still not used to the action, she froze out of reflex but was quick to relax. He wasn't going to hurt her. 

Carried into another room, she saw Sirius was passed out on a chair in the corner, and Remus was reading a book opposite of him. Seeing Severus walk in with Rose in his arms brought a smile to his face. 

""Alright, Rose?"" Remembering Severus rushing into her room after hearing her scream, she shyly nodded. ""I'm glad.""

""Is he alright?"" Asking about Sirius, Remus chuckled. 

""He'll be fine; he's just had a long day and is asleep."" Pushing the empty bottle of scotch away from Rose's sight, she diverted her attention to the sleeping boy. ""Harry...""

""Poppy came by and healed him; he's just asleep. Don't worry; he'll be fine. He even woke up a few times asking about you.""

""Few times? Did I sleep a long time?""

""It's been three days, love.""

""I slept for 3 days?! O-Oh, I-I'm sorry..."" 

""I'm sure you must've been exhausted. I'm glad you are resting."" Still shy of hearing such comments, Rose pulled on the edge of her shirt. 

""T-Thank you, sir... for saving Harry."" 

""Your most welcome, Rose."" Shyly smiling at Remus, he smiled back. 

""Why don't we let your brother sleep a little longer? Shall we go get you something to eat?"" 

""Y-Yes sir... please, sir."" Closing the door behind him, Remus followed Severus downstairs to the dining room. 

""You don't need to be so polite to us, Rose. Oh- now that I think about it, we've never properly introduced ourselves, how rude of us."" Setting her down in her chair, Remus started their introduction.

""I'm Remus Lupin. That man over there is Severus Snape, and the man upstairs is Sirius Black.""

""I-I'm Rose Lily Potter, and my brother is Harry James Potter... u-Uhm, it's nice to meet your acq... nice to meet you."" Petunia was always yelling at Rose that even if she weren't a lady nor ever be one, she would not tolerate her without simple manners. 

Chuckling, Remus held himself back from laughing out loud. He found it adorable and was sure if Sirius was here, he'd have cooed at her effort to reciprocate her introduction to them, although Rose thought otherwise. Thinking she messed up and was being made fun of, her face grew red, and she slid further into her seat. Severus quickly caught on to Rose's embarrassment and flicked a sugar cube at the chuckling werewolf. 

""O-Oh no, Rose, I wasn't laughing at you. I apologize; I merely found it adorable. Forgive me?"" Glancing at the man, she only nodded, but it was obvious the damage was already done. 

Severus glared at Remus, shaking his head; he told him where to find the tea and was forced into the kitchen. Alone with Rose, Severus wasn't sure how to interact with her- he's never been one for conversation. It was so easy before, so why was Severus having such a difficult time now? He was beginning to have a headache merely thinking about how he should start a conversation with a six-year-old. Speaking of six years...

""Rose?""

""Y-Yes, sir?""

""Is there anything you'd like for your birthday?"" 

""N-No, s-sir-! I-I'm grateful for everything already; I-I don't need anything else."" 

""I'm sure you and Harry want something. It is your birthday, after all.""

""... W-We aren't allowed.""

""Not allowed?""

""... Aunt Petunia said we freaks shouldn't ask for anything and that we were a mistake being born."" 

The ever-growing fury inside boiled as he listened to Rose's words, but moreover, he frowned that Rose believed those wretched people and wasn't worthy of anything. The past few days, he's observed the way she reacted and spoke; every time, he felt his heart being stabbed to see a child so brainwashed to think she was worth nothing and hold everything locked inside herself. 

""Rose, don't believe what that woman told you; she's always been jealous and prideful.""

""But...""

""I, for one, am glad you were born. I'm sure Black and Lupin will agree with me, as will your parents.""

""You're right. Sirius and I are grateful you were born. We were there when Lily gave birth to you and Harry. Quite an emotional day for us, especially Sirius."" 

Remembering the way Sirius's hands wouldn't stop shaking as he gently took hold of the twins, James had teased him that people would mistake him as the father rather than James. Sirius had retorted back he'd gladly be their father if need be; of course, nobody would've known it'd happen sooner than later. 

""... Really?""

""You both were the most precious thing we've seen in our lives. Lily cried, thanking you were born; she loved you both with all her heart.""

""We were loved...?""

""You still are."" 

Rose truly was dumbstruck; the past few days have been nothing short of a miracle. Was she truly allowed to let herself be happy? She could only nod to Remus's response; she didn't want to cry again in front of them. 

""You're our pups; nothing will ever change that.""

She was curious about one thing- why did he and Sirius call her and Harry pups? The only people who ever called them that were Moony and Padfoot, in their dreams. 

""U-Uhm... M-Mr. Lupin?""

""You needn't call me that, love-""

""Why do you call Harry and me- pups? The only people who called us that are... Moony and Padfoot-"" 

Remus dropped his teacup and stared at Rose. Severus' brow rose; he wasn't expecting that either. 

""I-I'm s-sorry, d-did I-I d-do something w-wrong? I-I'm sorry-"" Rambling her apologies, she paused when seeing Remus in tears and smiling.

""You remember us... oh, pup...""

""R-remember?""

""Remus here was part of a mischievous group called the Marauders. His nickname was-""

""Moony."" 

""T-Then upstairs...""

""That's right; he's Padfoot. Oh, pup, y-you remember us... I-I'm so glad..."" 

 

Harry is finally awake. 

Remus and Sirius are over the moon to know Harry and Rose remember them, even if it's just by name. 

During their first bath time-Severus notices Rose's true hair color.

Somehow Remus and Severus get into a stupid match- who can impress the twins more with magic...


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


'Rose?'


Harry had woken up in an unfamiliar room, and a man he didn't know was asleep sitting beside him holding his hand. Harry was flustered over the fact the man was holding his hand; nobody wanted to touch freaks like him and Rose. Surely it was a mistake. Slowly pulling his hand out, he froze when the man mumbled something. Moving his head to the side, Harry let out a sigh of relief and climbed down the bed. 

Looking around the room, he wasn't sure what to do. Had Uncle Vernon finally thrown him away to an orphanage or sold him off? After Rose had gone, Vernon always threatened him, saying that even if he weren't worth looking at, he'd still be useful in other ways... It always made Harry's skin crawl when he remembered the man who touched Rose. He could still remember hearing her crying for help in their mental link. 

If only he had helped her... maybe Rose would still be with him. 

Pushing the door open, he peeked outside and saw a staircase in front of him. Hearing voices downstairs, a shaky breath escaped him- so many scenarios went through his head, and all of them ended with him being punished. Gathering what little courage he had, he made his way down the stairs. 

At the bottom of the stairs, he heard music being played in the sitting room. Glancing around, he heard the voices again- it was coming from the dining room. Gripping to his shirt, he slowly crept to the noise. Expecting the worst, he opened his mouth to apologize for sleeping so long but was left frozen seeing who the voices belonged to--one person in particular.

""R-Rose?"" 

Turning to the side, her face lit up as she let out an involuntary shriek of happiness. ""H-Harry-!! Y-You're awake-!"" Practically falling off the chair, she was just caught by the man in the dark robes as he let out a sigh of relief before gently letting her down on the floor and telling the girl to be careful. His words went across her ears as she ran to her twin and engulfed him in her embrace. 

""I-I'm glad you are awake..."" Not holding back her tears, she cried for her brother. 

He wasn't sure how Rose could be here. Had they both been sent to the same owner? Was this where they say their goodbyes and never see one another again? Were they going to be kept apart from one another although under the same owner? This had to be a dream... It was all too much for Harry. He didn't want to lose Rose again; she was all he had- they had to be together. Harry was next to let his waterworks flow, gripping onto her shirt; he cried louder than he has ever before. 

""R-Rose-! Rose!!! 

I-I thought y-you were gone...! I-I... we were supposed to be.... forever-! Together-!!"" 

Their cries echoed through the manor as the two men at the dining table sadly smiled at the sibling's reunion. Letting them cry as they wish, another man was running in a panic over the boy's disappearance.

""PUP IS GONE-!! IS HE DOWN HERE?! IS HE WITH YOU-!?

IS ROSE WITH YOU TOO?! ARE THEY BOTH THERE?!"" 

Running down the stairs and barely keeping his balance as he tripped over the carpet, Remus chuckled and calmed the frantic man whilst Severus rolled his eyes. 

""Always with the dramatics...""

""Harry is fine; he and Rose are just fine.""

""Whe- oh, thank Merlin."" Catching his breath, he leaned against a chair, mumbling about being too young about a heart attack. Remus patted his shoulder whilst laughing. Calming himself, he walked over to the crying twins and kneeled. Taking out a handkerchief, he brushed his hand against Rose's hair and smiled, ""I'm glad you two are alright.""

Wiping away her tears, she shyly nodded and tried to stop her tears as Harry tried doing the same. Holding Rose's hand, he stared at Sirius and the way he was wiping away Rose's tears. 

The man was touching Rose the way Petunia would care for Dudley when he got hurt after tripping. Nobody ever does that for them, nor will they ever...

Turning to Harry, he flinched and gripped Rose's hand in instinct. Sirius held out his hand and held out the dirty handkerchief. Unsure what he meant with the gesture, his eyes lit up when he saw the handkerchief transform into a clean one, but it was a different design. It was almost like magic.

""Magic...?"" Gasping, he covered his mouth with his hands and quickly apologized. ""I-I'm s-sorry, I-I didn't mean to s-say the b-bad word..."" 

""Nonsense, pup. You've done nothing wrong."" Wiping the stray tears on Harry's face, he gently lowered the boy's hands and smiled at him. ""I'm sure it must've been overwhelming for you. Your sister was the same.""

""...D-Did Uncle V-Vernon sell us to you? A-Are you our new owner?""

""What...?""

""I-I'm sorry, sir-! P-Please d-don't hit me, I-I promise to be good, s-so p-please let me stay w-with Rose-! P-Please-!!""

It was like watching Rose on the first day all over again. The pain and hurt they've gone through to react the same way... Sirius felt like a failure. What kind of Godfather was he? He couldn't even properly protect his pups... How would he be able to gain their trust if they stared at him with such caution? Rose may have opened up a little, but she was ever so wary of him and Remus. She seemed to trust Severus more than him...

""Harry. I'll never take Rose away from you, nor will I ever hit you. Never. 

I'd rather die before I ever raise a hand on either one of you."" 

Was he lying? Was he tricking them? But his eyes... the way he was staring at them and his tone towards them, it made Harry want to believe him...

""Padfoot won't hurt us... right?"" Not sounding so confident, Rose squeezed Harry's hand. He glanced at Rose, surprised to hear the name.

""Padfoot...?"" Looking back at Sirius, who was just as shocked, Harry's eyes lit up. ""Padfoot...!""

""Y-You remember me, pup?"" Shyly nodding, Remus stood behind Sirius, pulling him up to his feet. 

""She remembers us...""

""O-Oh... Oh. I-I'm so glad..."" 

""As much as I'd hate to interrupt your tears fest... I do believe the children require a meal."" Severus stood behind Harry and Rose, turning them towards the dining room. Remus had to hold Sirius back from going after Severus.

""Why I ought to! That son-""

""Sirius. CHILDREN."" Remus warned. Angrily breathing in and out, he grumbled whilst Remus waited for him to calm down. 

Helping the twins into their seats, Severus took extra care being slow and gentle with Harry. Pushing their seats towards the table- plates, cups, and silverware floated towards them and set themselves onto the table. No matter how many times Rose has seen it, she was still amazed. Harry, on the other hand, was mind-blown. It was magic. Actually magic-! Magic really existed; he and Rose weren't the only ones to perform such feats. 

""Are you going to grumble all day, or will you be helping?"" Severus called out to Sirius and Remus. Sirius glared at the man as Remus walked over to help Severus. 

Alone with the twins, Sirius sat across from them and smiled. Rose shyly smiled back, but Harry avoided eye contact and shifted in his seat. Tugging on the hem of Rose's shirt, she glanced to see her twin staring at her nervously. 

'Is he really... Padfoot?' Nodding, she smiles at Harry to try and calm him down.


'T-they were n-nice to me, let me eat food and never hit me.'


Glancing at Sirius and back at Rose, he was hesitant to believe Rose. She would lie when she was hurt or sad, but he's noticed that she wasn't looking as sickly and pale as she used to. He could see a slight rosiness in her cheeks, and he could barely see the outline of her bones in her arms and legs. Perhaps she was really telling the truth...

'Okay...' Deciding the believe her, Rose beamed a genuine smile at her brother. Sirius was observing the two and was amazed at how quickly Harry was at ease by looking at Rose. It was almost like they were communicating with one another...

""Alright?"" Remus asked.

""Just about."" Sirius replied, moving his arms off the table; brunch was served. Severus was last to join them.

""Bon appetite."" Remus smiled at the twins indicating they could dig in, but Harry was stuck in a dilemma- can he really eat it? Should he even touch it even if they said he could? Was it a cruel prank?

The three men saw a repeat with Rose and her pancakes...

As if looking at Rose for confirmation, she picked up a strawberry in her hand and with her fork. Handing Harry the fork, she bit into the strawberry and looked at Harry. Looking at the strawberry and the men staring at them, he hesitantly took the offered fruit. Taking a small nibble, his eyes lit up so sweet and sour yet fresh; he's never had anything like this before. It was delicious!! 


'Harry, Harry, try the french toast. It's terrific!'


'French toast?' Pointing at the pan-fried soaked bread, Rose tried to reach for the syrup, but it was out of reach. Sirius flicked the syrup to Harry's plate and poured over his french toast. Watching the syrup floating back to its spot on the table, he stared at it with awe. He was curious what other kind of magic they can do. 

""Shall I cut it for you?"" Severus asked. Glancing over, he saw Rose's plate pushed towards her. The man had cut the french toast for Rose. Nodding, Severus cut into small pieces and handed him back his plate. 

Taking a piece onto his fork, he stared at it. He's seen Dudley eat this before, and he'd always drown it in syrup. He'd always tease him and Rose about how good it was and that freaks like them aren't worthy of such a treat. Nibbling on the toast, it was like a whole new world. It was soft, warm, and sweet. It really was delicious. To think he'd be able to have such a wonderful thing. 

Thinking it'll be taken away from him; he scarfed it down.

""Pup, you'll choke. Eat slowly, don't worry, nobody is going to take it from you."" Taking a breather, he chewed what was in his mouth and swallowed. He apologized in a deep breath, but Sirius smiled, saying he had nothing to apologize for. 

Once Harry and Rose had their fill, they were asked again if they were still hungry. Shaking their heads, Remus suggested they should have a bath before they head out. A bath? What was a bath? 


'Do you know what a bath is, Harry...?'



'N-No... a-are we going to punished?'



'B-But they promised... they wouldn't...' 


Seeing the confusion on their faces, Sirius asked. ""Have you never had a bath before?"" Embarrassed, they didn't answer.

""S-Surely..."" Sirius was completely dumbfounded. How could they never have bathed before? Petunia was truly a cruel being- not worthy of being a human being. 

""A-Aunt Petunia said we s-should've been thankful to be hosed..."" Harry answered.

""Hosed-?!"" Startled by Sirius's sudden voice raise, Remus was quick to reprimand him. 

""Sirius-!"" Shutting his mouth, Sirius saw the twins were shaking. 

""O-Oh, I'm so sorry, pups. I wasn't angry at you, I promise."" 

""R-Really?"" Rose asked. 

""Really. I'm sorry, I was just upset for you-""

""For us? Why?"" They were confused. Was not having a bath a bad thing?

""Why don't we head on upstairs? I'll draw the bath for you."" Remus walked over to the twins and held out his hand. Rose automatically took his hand as Harry nervously mimicked her action. Pulling them into his arms, Harry froze. He was carrying them in his arms. 

""W-We can walk, sir...""

""Aren't we heavy, sir?"" Rose asked worriedly. 

Chuckling, he shook his head. ""Lighter than a feather. Are you both uncomfortable?"" Shaking their heads, he continued up the stairs.

 

~~

~~

 

So this was a bath.

The large black tub filled with warm water and a rubber ducky? Duckies? Why were there so many duckies in the tub? Was it special?

Standing by the door frame, Harry and Rose wrapped in large towels stared at Remus putting his hand into the water. Nodding in satisfaction, he held out his hand to the twins and told them the bath was ready. Waddling over, they stood on their toes to see the tub. 

The water was clear. They could feel the steam from the water warm their cheeks. 

Petunia never used warm nor lukewarm water for them. The water pressure would hurt them. When they were just old enough to walk, they couldn't withstand the pressure and ended up falling with mud and grass on their bum and arms. Of course, Petunia would only throw them a paper towel to clean themselves up, saying she wouldn't waste any more precious water on freaks like them. 

Sitting in the warm water, the warmth wrapping around their frail bodies had them sinking further into the bath. Remus was glad they were relaxed. 

""Harry. Rose. Would you sit up for me?"" Doing as told, Remus began washing Harry's hair first. Rose sunk deeper into the water and moved away. Seeing Rose moving away, he asked he'll wash her hair next, but she shook her head. 

Explaining, he only wanted to have her hair cleaned; she continued to refuse. He didn't understand why. Hopefully, the one knocking on the door can help him convince Rose to wash her hair. 

""Lupin, I brought more towels and a serum- something the matter?"" 

""Well..."" Raising a brow, he glanced over to Rose to see her sunken into the bathwater avoiding eye contact with either one of them.

Kneeling on the other side of the tub, he called out to Rose. She nodded in response. Glancing at one another, Severus saw Remus shaking his head in confusion and whispering to him about washing their hair and Rose to refuse it to be washed.

Worried she'd be in trouble, Harry gently patted Remus's hand. Looking down, Harry was worriedly glancing at Rose and Remus. About to reassure the boy that he wasn't mad at her, Harry held his hands around his mouth, whispering something to Remus. He didn't catch it first, so he leaned down to hear what Harry had to say. 

Oh. She thought... 

Whilst Harry was whispering to Remus, Severus noticed a small amount of black floating on the water. Following the trail, it was coming from Rose's hair. He was caught off guard when he saw a bright color of red was peeking by the top of her head. 


Red. 


Her hair was red. 

""Rose, are you perhaps ashamed about your hair color?"" Sinking further into the water, her face heated up from embarrassment. 

""Oh, Rose. You needn't be embarrassed. In fact, you look exactly like Lily. She was a redhead as well."" Tugging on the ends of her hair, she looked up. 

""I'd say you both are an exact copy of your parents."" Sitting up, she glanced at Severus. 

""I-It's not disgusting...?""

""Absolutely not. Who would- oh. Did she make you dye your hair black?"" 

""A-Aunt Petunia said... my freaky hair was like mum. She said I'm freaky like her... it was a disgusting color...""

""She's wrong, Rose. It's a beautiful color. Lily would've been thrilled to see that you had her hair color."" Remus agreed.

""T-That's right, Rose-! I like your hair-!"" Startled to hear Harry raise his voice, the washroom grew silent. Looking around in a panic, he began mumbling apologies, but Remus chuckled. 

Rose stared at the ends of her hair. She did hate the cheap dye that Petunia always made her use, it would always hurt, and the smell would make her nauseous. But whenever she told Petunia that, she'd make her soak her hair in charcoal. It would irritate her eyes and make her cough non-stop- Petunia and Vernon would hit her for being so noisy in the middle of the night. After that, she didn't complain about the cheap dye and withstood the pain in her hair. 

It was nice to know that she and Harry had the same hair color with the dye, but Harry would tell her that he didn't like it. He said it reminded him of Petunia's garden roses; it suited her just like Rose's name. 

""We won't force you, but you will feel much better if you have your hair washed."" Severus said. 

Tugging on ends of her hair, she wondered. Was it really okay? Red Hair was not a lady-like color, nor was it as common from what Rose had seen. But they all said they liked it; they didn't say it was disgusting and weird... Perhaps- 

Taking the chance, Rose muttered out a small 'okay.' 

Remus told Severus he'll finish up helping Harry, so he was in charge of Rose. Taken back, his brows furrowed. Him? Surely Lupin isn't serious- he'd be a better choice in helping the twins bathe. Seeing Lupin glare at Severus, he didn't really have much choice. 

Sighing, he took off his robes and pulled up his sleeves. Tying his hair to a small ponytail, he grabbed the shampoo and serum.

""Close your eyes for me, Rose."" Flicking his finger to the bath, a small portion of the water gathered itself into a sphere and floated over Rose's head. The twins were fascinated. 

Seeing the twins so intrigued by a sphere of water, Severus couldn't hide his smirk. Remus felt his eye twitch- oh, two can play this game... 

Duplicating the sphere into smaller spheres, it began streaming small rivers going around the twins. A few split off from the river and formed themselves into fish. The twins' eyes were practically sparkling at this point. 

Severus felt a vein pop. Was he really going to be so childish...? Was he really going to stoop down such idiotic- 


Yes. 


Slipping his wand out of his robes, he glared at Remus. That triumphant smirk of his... it really irked him. Always the damn Gryffindors in his life- but he wasn't going to back down in this. 


They are both idiots at this point...


Muttering as he flicked his wand, the water fell back into the bath, much to the twins' disappointment, but something softly landed on top of Harry's nose. Rubbing his nose, it fell into the water. 

A flower petal? 

Flowers of all kinds began showering above them. Rose was the first to let out a small sound of fascination as Harry's mouth shaped into an 'o'.


'Flowers-! Harry-!! Flowers are raining!!'



'It's beautiful...'



'wow...'


""Flowers... how unlike you."" Snickering at Severus' choice of charm, Remus had taken out his wand. 

""Well, at least I had done something creative unlike you who took something I've done and merely added onto-""

""I can be creative, plenty."" Flicking the light switch off, sparkles shot out of the tip of his wand. Illuminating the room slightly, the sparklers shot out and began flying around like the snitch. Drawing the twins' names and ending with a small firework, Harry clapped his hands. Turning the light back on, the two men continued to show the twins spells and charms- each one was just as fascinating and mind-blowing to them. 

 

~~

~~

 

Putting down the Daily Prophet, he looked up at the ticking clock. It's been almost three hours now; the day has grown much too late. They'll have to push their shopping day to tomorrow. What are they doing up there? It was quite noisy, but it's been quiet now for a while... Sirius decided to go check up on the twins. 

Knocking on the door of the washroom, he was met with silence. Peeking inside, he saw nobody was there, but it was quite a mess. Water and suds lathered on the floor and walls. Were that scorch marks on the walls? Why are there so many flower petals on the floor? 

""Pa'foot?"" Peeking into the washroom looking at Sirius 

""Oh, pup."" Smiling at the shy boy, he walked out of the disaster of a washroom and leaned down to Harry, caressing his head. ""How was your bath?""

The boy's eyes lit up, and he smiled as he rambled about everything he saw. ""I-it was so pretty-! A-And everything was- there was water floating and fish-!! The flower was raining on us and, and- and-!"" Seeing the child so excited made Sirius's heart melt and smile even wider. 

""I take it you had a good first bath?"" Seeing how fast he was nodding, Sirius was worried he'd get whiplash. Chuckling, he picked Harry up into his arms- Harry shyly smiled back. It was a relief to know that Harry was at such ease to smile as he should've. Sirius hoped he'd only see the Harry and Rose happy from now on- he'll make sure of it...

""Where is Rose?""

""Oh! R-Rose, she... Uhm..."" Trying to explain, his sentences were all twisted, making him gesture his hands around his hair. Sirius merely found it adorable. 

""There you are. Had thought you ran off to find Rose."" Remus was cleaning up the last of the towels. 

""I didn't realize it was possible to make Pup's hair even more untamable."" 

""Just like James.""

""Rose-!"" Turning around, Sirius beamed at the sight. Letting Harry back down to the ground, he scurried to Rose. Happily saying how much she looks better, she blushed and nodded in thanks. Sirius felt a sudden surge of longing for his now gone friends, how much they looked like Lily and James. Just seeing them in front of him, it felt as if they've never gone away... How funny.

""Truly like a rose. You look wonderful."" 

""I-It's really okay? My hair color...?""

""Why, of course. If anybody ha anything to say about it, I'll give them a good few whacks before casting a transfiguration spell on them.""

""I'd appreciate it if you didn't involve me in your evil deeds, Black.""

""As if you won't do the same, Snivellus.""

""Do not put me in the same category as you. It's difficult enough breathing the same air with you.""

""That's what I'd like to say-!!""

""Why don't we go have some tea?"" 

""Remus-! Back me up!""

""Milk and sugar?"" 

""REMUS!"" 

Apologies for the rushed chap-

(I might've tweaked a few spells... I tried to keep it to the original function of the spell/ charm/ jinx as possible)

Time for a shopping spree-!!

Apologies for the late update and the sloppy writing-Thank you for the kudos and kind comments. I hope the future chap are to your liking :)


  FREAKS!!  



  ROTTEN!! USELESS!!!   



  YOU SHOULD HAVE PERISHED WITH YOUR FREAK LIKE PARENTS-!!!  



 ""n-no... we..."" 



  FREAKS!  



  YOU BOTH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BORN-!!!  



 ""N-NO-!! S-STOP IT-!!!!"" 


 

It was only a dream.

Harry had woken up in a cold sweat and shiver running down his spine. Clutching the covers as a lifeline, he took a few shallow breaths and tried to remember where he was. Rose, feeling her brother's distress, woke up drowsily and held his hand. Harry was quick to flinch but relax at the touch seeing it was only Rose. 


'R-Rose...?'



'Harry? You have a bad dream?'



'S-Sorry... did I-I wake you?'



'S'Okay... we're okay.' 


Pulling him back down towards the pillows, Harry stared at Rose. Did she not have nightmares as he did? Was she not scared?

""Me too...""

""Hm?""

""I get them too... I get scared...""

He was ridiculous. Of course, she'd get them too... Of course, she was scared. When were they never?

""But... we'll be okay, right?""

Rose wasn't confident; they'll be okay from now on. Even if they were told and reassured, again and again, they couldn't truly trust the idea of being- happy, safe, and loved. It felt too much of a luxury for them...

""If we're not... we still have each other... right?"" Asking worriedly, Harry gripped her hand. 


""Always..."" 


 

~~

~~

 

Sirius was at a loss. He didn't know what he was going to do...

""What are you doing?"" Seeing Sirius sighing and his arms crossed, he seemed to be deep in thought but kept looking down. Wondering what he was doing, he walked up behind only to see two clothing articles in front of the Sirius- two white long night-shirts. 

""If you are wondering what shirt you need to wear, I think nobody will be looking so intensely."" Replying in a joking manner, he expected Sirius to give him one of his infamous dramatics, but instead, he only sighed again and held his head down. 

""Well, obviously, this is new. Whatever seems to be the problem?"" Asking again in a sarcastic tone. 

""This is it.""

""Pardon?""

""This is all they have to wear.""

""Harry and Rose?""

""Who else? They have this and two shirts Snivellus had shrunk for them.""

""We did say we were going to go shopping.""

""Yes...""

""I'm sorry to say I'm not following why you are at such a loss...""

""I can't decide what will be cuter on them..."" Looking down again, Remus felt a vein pop- the man was sighing over a clothing catalog, unsure where he should start to buy the twins' clothes. Sirius had gotten his head smacked by the catalog. 

Wasting no more time, the two men apparated to the front of Severus' home. Knocking on the door, they were less than greeted by the Potion's master. Scowling at Sirius, he opened the door nonetheless and allowed them to enter. Asking why they suddenly decided to have manners, Sirius lip twitched but held back his annoyance. Not wanting to suddenly startle the twins again like the last time they suddenly appeared in front of them, Severus let out a mocking huff- ""How considerate of you."" 

Seeing it was still early in the morning, nobody went up the stairs to greet the twins. Wanting them to sleep as long as they wished, they walked into the dining room but were surprised to see two pairs of green eyes standing by their seats. 

""Rose, Harry. Why are you awake? The sun has barely risen."" To say Remus and Sirius weren't taken back by the sudden gentleness in Severus' voice would be an understatement. 

""W-We s-slept l-long enough, sir..."" Harry nodded. Severus let out a small sigh. 

The past few days with the twins were, to say the least, much too easy. Children weren't meant to be so well-behaved and calm; if anything, the three men were hoping one of them would at least complain once about anything. Cause a ruckus, yell to the top of their lungs, run around or cause a mess as they played. All they did most of the day was sit on the couch and stare at the empty hearth or read a book they were given. Remus and Sirius had brought back some old toys Sirius used to play with when he was younger, but the twins would only stare at the toys and neatly place them aside. 

Severus had even tried to have the twins take a nap on the couch after lunch, but they had profusely refused and sat still. Even with the tea he had given them in the hope of allowing themselves to relax and let their guard down, they fought their drowsiness. Nodding their heads off, they pinched themselves awake or even shook one another in hopes of not falling asleep. Severus' expression soured seeing the twins trying so hard to be awake. Unable to watch them torture themselves, he had lied to them that it was already time for bed. Thankfully due to their drowsiness, they weren't able to tell.

He had told them that they needn't be so formal nor wake up so early, but old habits were hard to fix. No matter how many times they were told they were allowed to sleep in and needn't call Severus, Remus and Sirius- 'sir,' they immediately refused. In tears and apologizing, it took them all to calm the twins- after that, they decided best not to bring it up again...

""Harry, Rose, you needn't get up so early. Why are you- what is all this?"" Sirius noticed the table was set. 

""U-Uhm... w-we made breakfast...""

""W-We d-did our best..."" 

""You made all this?"" Severus was shocked he hadn't heard anything nor noticed anything. 

The twins tugged on their shirts nervously; the three men had grown silent. Did they make a mistake? They were sure they did everything on time, and everything was set as it should-

""It looks wonderful. Shall we all take a seat?"" Remus smiled. 

Being helping into their seats, the twins glanced at one another before looking at the men staring at the food spread out in front of them. 


'D-Do you think they hate it?'



'M-maybe t-they might hit us...'



'...I-I d-don't want that. They promised...'


""This is superb."" Breaking out of their mental link, they looked up to see they were all eating. 

""Indeed. You've both done a wonderful job."" Hearing such praise, they shyly looked to their lap and fiddled with their hands. Severus glanced down to see the cuts and small burns on their hands and arms. Placing his fork down, the twins immediately shot up and tensed. 

""Harry. Rose.""

""Y-Yes, sir...?""

""S-Sir?""

""This is delicious, but please do not do it again.""

""W-We're sorry, s-sir... d-did we mess s-something u-up?""

""W-We can r-redo it, s-sir-! R-Really-!!""

""You misunderstand me.

I do not want you to use the kitchen until you are older. You are both hurt."" Looking down at their injuries, they hid it behind their backs. 

""W-We are okay, sir...""

""Nonsense. It must've hurt-""

""I-It's really okay-""

""Harry James Potter. Rose Lily Potter."" Flinching, they saw Sirius and Remus were looking at them with the same seriousness as Severus.

""W-We-""

""W-We only w-wanted t-to something f-for s-sirs... w-we d-didn't want to get in trouble..."" Tears at the brink of falling, Severus and Sirius had come up behind the twins. Turning the chair to face them, they began treating the small cuts and burns. 

""We appreciate it, pup, but it's not worth it if you are both hurt. You needn't do such things."" Sirius spoke as softly as he can as he smiled at Harry. The poor boy was ready to burst into tears.

""You may have been asked to do these tasks by your aunt and uncle, but you needn't do them here. All you need is to do what all children do."" Severus finished wrapping their burns and sternly held his finger at the two. ""Promise you will never go into the kitchen or any place with such dangerous things by yourselves.""

A little dumbfounded, Harry and Rose glanced at one another before nodding. ""Y-Yes, sir... we promise."" With a curt nod of satisfaction, Remus held back his chuckle- who would've thought the cold and heartless Potion's Master was so soft towards Harry and Rose.

""But sir...?"" Harry called out to Severus.

""Yes?""

""... W-What do you mean...?""

""That's simple, pup."" Sirius grinned, ruffling Harry's hair. ""Eat, sleep, have lots of fun.""

""Fun?"" 

""We can start today."" The twins tilted their heads and stared at one another. 


'??'


 

~~

~~

 

Diagon Alley. 

It was the name of the shopping area they were going to. The twins had their doubts, shopping in an alleyway- Petunia had told them frightening stories that led them to tears and nightmares. Were they going to take them to such a scary place? Were they bad? They wouldn't throw them away... would they? 

Sitting on the couch whilst waiting for the men to finish preparing, the twins pondered over Severus' and Sirius' words. 


'Harry...?'



'Yeah?'



'Were we bad for making breakfast...?'



'... I-I don't think so, b-but they were upset.'



'They said we aren't allowed in the kitchen... did we mess up?'



'... M-Maybe, b-but they didn't hit us. Like they promised.'



'...'



'W-We can do other things too! W-We can clean the house later!'



'Laundry too. We can do everything...'



'Do you think they'll be upset again...?'



'I-I hope not...'


Pondering over what they can do to 'help' around the house, they hadn't realized Remus and Sirius calling for them until they felt their touch. Snapping out of their link, the two men chuckled, ""Alright?""

""W-We're s-sorry.""

""It's okay, pup. You must be nervous going out, but there isn't a reason to be. I'm sure you'll both love it.""

""It'll be busy at this time, so make sure to stay by our side, okay?"" Remus said. 

""Yes, sir.""

""Snivellus, are you ready?!"" 

""If you'll stop your barking, I'm already behind you."" 

Pulling Sirius away from Severus, Remus scooped Rose into his arms. ""Please do not start any of bickering so early in the morning."" 

""Why do I put up with you?"" Sirius sighed as he picked up Harry into his arms. 

""That would be my line, mutt.""

""You-""

""Why don't we just have our own date and leave these idiots behind?"" Remus asked Rose.

""Date?""

""Ah-! Remus, don't you dare have a date by yourself with Rose!"" Ignoring his friend, he tightened his hold on Rose and told her to hold on tight and apparated. 

Rose felt like her head was going to split, and her stomach felt funny. Groaning at the queasiness she felt, Remus stroked her back, trying to ease her pain. 

""I'm sorry, love. Perhaps we should've flooed instead, but you still would've felt sick. Does it hurt a lot?"" Taking a few deep breaths, she waited until the throbbing in her head completely disappeared before shaking her head. 

""It's okay now...""

""I'm sorry, love. 

It happens to everyone the first time, but it's most likely more difficult for you and Harry. You'll get used to it when you get older."" Patting her back as he waited for her pain to subside, she glanced to see the others have appeared behind them. Harry looked like he was going to hurl. 

""Does it hurt, pup?"" 

""Hence why I suggested we floo."" Severus said. 

""He would have felt it either way...""

""It's only momentary; you should feel the pain and queasiness go away in a moment."" Harry weakly nodded as Sirius stroked his head, trying to calm him. Seeing Rose's complexion wasn't as terrible as Harry's, he sighed in relief but asked if she was alright. She nodded and said she was okay. As Severus said, the pain was only a moment, but it was still unpleasant.

Walking out of the dark corner of a shop, they came to face a cobblestoned alley and various shops littering the alley left and right. It was nothing like what Harry and Rose had imagined. It was bustling with many people- witches and wizards, bright and full of shops. Looking around the shops, the twins were amazed at what they were seeing. 

From owls to floating brooms, everything amazed the twins. This was all magic.

""What do you think of Diagon Alley, pups?"" Sirius asked, grinning at the doe-eyed twins. 

""I-It's amazing...""

""Is everyone here, magic?"" Chuckling, Remus patted Rose's back. 

""Witches and Wizards, love. Of course, there are a few muggles as well.""

""Muggles?"" 

""Non-magic humans."" Severus explained. 

""But I thought only magic people...?"" Harry was confused. 

""Well, there is the exception of muggle-born witches and wizards, and not to mention those muggle-born witches and wizards come here with their parents when they go off to school.""

""School? There is a magic school?"" Rose asked. 

""Of course. You'll both be going when you turn eleven; to the greatest magic school, there is- Hogwarts.""

""Did sirs go there too?"" 

""Of course, and as did your parents. Snivellus, here is a Potion's Master there.""


'Did you hear, Harry? A magic school-!'



'C-Can we really go?'



'I-I hope so, Mum and Dad also went...'



'mmh...'


""We can talk more about Hogwarts another time. Remus, didn't you and Snivellus need to pick up a few things?""

""Ah, yes, we shouldn't take too long-""

""Don't worry about them; I'll take care of them. We'll be fine, right, pups?"" Handing Rose to Sirius, he balanced the twins against his hip and ushered the two men to go and hurry with their shopping. Leaving them, Sirius looked around and smiled, spotting what he was looking for. 


Sugarplum's Sweet Shop.


""How about a few sweets?"" 

""B-But it's still morning..."" Rose looked around worriedly as if she would be hit if she mentioned wanting sweets. Harry nodded. 

""I-It'll be bad if we eat sweets...""

""Well. I don't know about you, but I think a few pieces can't hurt."" Setting the twins on the ground, they worriedly glanced at one another and stared at Sirius. 

""But...""

""Anything you want, you need only ask, pups. 

You don't need to hold back asking. I'll make sure to spoil you both rotten."" Sirius had said it with the best intentions, but the reactions from the twins were them fiddling with their shirts and looking to the ground. He and Remus will have to try and fix that habit... it hurt his heart whenever the twins would deny themselves anything, saying they didn't deserve it or had earned it.

""How about we all share? If Remus says anything, you can just say it was my idea."" Sirius grinned.

""B-But you'll get in trouble.""

""Trouble is my specialty. I can guarantee you both you'll love it."" Blinking at the words Sirius had just said, the twins glanced at one another before letting out a small chuckle. 

""You can't do that, Pa'foot... t-that'll be bad for you."" Rose shyly had looked away, realizing what she said, but Sirius was beaming and ruffled her hair. 

""Nothing wrong with being a lil bad."" 

""But you might get hurt, P-Pa'foot."" Harry worriedly flapped his arms, trying to make a point to Sirius, but it only made him happier. 

""Awwww, you're worried for me. My god-son and god-daughter are such angels-!!"" Crushing them into his arms, they were confused in the sudden embrace, but they didn't complain. It made them happy. 

Walking into the sweets shop, Harry and Rose felt as if they had walked into a wonderland of sweets. Could such a place even exist? There were so many different types of sweets! Can they really look around?

Looking left to right, Sirius suppressed his laughter- they were so adorable. Giving them a gentle push, the twins looked over their shoulder to see Sirius smiling and tilting his head towards the store. They had the green light- go.

Walking around the busy shop, they looked around and didn't know what most of the sweets were. Everything was all new to them. What do they do? How much were they allowed to take? Can they pick anything? Watching the other children and adults pick out their favorite sweets and going to the cashier, they saw Sirius was looking around. Unsure what they could pick or should choose, they looked around until an older woman smiled at them.


'So many sweets...'



'I've never seen so many-!'



'That's the biggest lolly I've ever seen!!!'



'Rose-! Rose! Look at that!!'



'Dudley always ate sweets... he always made fun of us...'



'yeah...'


""Hello, sweeties. Need help finding something?""

""U-Uhm... w-we's sorry w-we were just looking...""

""There's no need to apologize. This must be your first time here; welcome."" The old lady was nice; she reminded them of their old neighbor, Mrs. Figgs. Although she was slightly odd and had many cats, she still gave them a slice of fruitcake when she saw them- of course; she only saw Harry. They were never allowed to go outside together, and back then, Rose was forced to dye her hair. Nobody could tell the difference with the same hair color, scar, broken glasses, and scrawny figure. 

""T-Thank you..."" 

""Does anything catch your fancy?""

""U-Uhm..."" 

""Harry! Rose! Did you pick anything you want?"" 

""Pa-foot...""

""Uhm... we don't know..."" 

""I had thought so...

Which is why I grabbed everything I thought you'd like."" Showing his haul, the twins stood there in shock. 

""P-Pa'foot t-that's too much-!""

""Oh my."" Chuckling, the old woman smiled, ""You must be their father."" 

""God-father actually, but I guess father doesn't sound so bad."" Grinning, the twins were flustered. 

""My goodness, that's quite the haul you have. Why don't I help you out there."" Taking him the register, Harry's eye caught a striped box. Sirius turned to ask if they wanted anything else but saw Harry staring at the box. Smiling, he grabbed it and added it to their haul. Feeling guilty about Sirius buying the sweet that caught his eye, he held Rose's hand out of nervousness. 

""There. All done. 

I added a few Treakle Tarts and chocolate frogs for you and the dearies."" 

""Why, thank you. You are too kind."" Showing off his smile, the old lady chuckled. 

""Hope you enjoy it, dearies."" Smiling at the twins, they shyly thanked the woman and left the shop with Sirius. 

Finding a bench nearby, they took a seat and begun digging into their treasure trove. Everything that Sirius had bought them so delicious; it was all wonderful. To think they'd be able to have so many sweets or any at all felt so surreal. Sirius couldn't stop smiling, watching the twins nibble on the sweets he'd give them.

Getting to the last of the sweets, Sirius pulled out the striped box Harry was staring at earlier. Harry leaned onto Sirius' arm to see what it was as Rose merely stared at the striped box. Sirius was ready to die of happiness- why were his pups so adorable? Opening the box, he chuckled at the contents inside, such nostalgia. 

""Jelly beans?"" 

""Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans."" Sirius corrected as he showed the twins the different colored beans inside. Giving it a small shake, he chuckled, ""And they do mean every flavour."" Holding the box out to Harry, he hesitantly took a few into his hands as Rose did the same. Taking a small amount, he held out his beans to show the twins and picked a random one popping it into his mouth. Staring at Sirius, they waited for his reaction. 

Chewing, he began chuckling, ""Tastes exactly as I remember it. Thank goodness I got licorice this time."" 

Glancing at one another, they popped a random bean into their mouth. Harry stuck out his tongue as he chewed the bean as his cheeks hollowed. Shutting his eyes, he pursed his lip and swallowed. Sirius asked what it tasted like. 

""Lemon..."" Chuckling, he over at Rose; she looked confused. 

""Rose?""  She nodded; Sirius wasn't following. ""Same flavour?""

""N-No...

it's..."" 


'What's wrong, Rose? Bad flavour?'



'I ate a rose...'



'rose?'



'rose...' 


Harry's mouth twitched as Rose pouted and stared at Harry. Looking at the twins, Sirius was now completely sure that they had can speak to one another telepathically- it was quite fascinating. Seeing Rose pouting, he smiled to himself and ruffled her hair, ""Was it that terrible?""

""Rose...""

""Pardon?""

""It tasted like a rose..."" Harry began laughing loudly, surprising Sirius. Who would've known pup had such a bright laugh? He hoped he and Rose continued to smile and laugh.

""What a coincidence. Rose ate a rose, my goodness, you ate your own kind?!"" 

""I-I'm human-!! N-Not a flower!"" Sirius raised a brow, asking if she was sure, to which she only pouted again and stared at Sirius. It wasn't long till the two couldn't hold back their own chuckles and join Harry. As their laughter died down, they went back to their roulette of flavours- it had become quite a game between the three of them. Harry was on a winning streak- Rose wasn't having the best of luck whilst Sirius was getting odd flavours, the weirdest of them all- sausage.

""What are you doing...?"" Severus and Remus had finished their shopping. 

Sirius chuckled and held up the box making the two men 'oh' at the nostalgia- when was the last time they tried one? Offering them the box, Remus took a few beans as Severus sighed and decided to indulge in the silly antics. He was more pressured to see the twins staring at him with such curiousness. 

""Huh... lawn clippings and... corn?""

""You're doing better than poor Rose over here."" Patting her back, she swallowed the last of her bean and grimaced at the flavour- rotten egg. Harry, on the other hand, had finished his caramel flavour. 

""... coffee and licorice."" 

""Oh pup, you have the worst luck..."" Sirius sadly chuckled as he handed her a treacle tart to wash out the terrible beans. 

""Shall we head onto the mall?"" Remus smiled. 

""I do hope you aren't thinking of wearing that to the muggle world."" Sirius pointed to Severus' robes. 

""We're wasting daylight. Come along."" Picking Rose into his arms, he walked away, ignoring Sirius's dramatics. Remus sighed and followed the Potions Master with Harry. 

""Don't leave me behind-!!"" 

 

~~

~~

 

Harry and Rose had come to the city a few times, but they were never allowed to go inside the mall when the Dursleys brought them along, much to their displeasure. They've seen the outside of it but never the inside. 

""Do you think we have enough?"" Sirius asked Remus. Holding out the muggle money they had converted, Severus rolled his eyes. 

""You may as well wave the money around to tell these muggles to steal it from you."" 

""I'm only checking- what are you wearing...?"" Severus had changed to muggle clothes, but it was oddly flattering on him- it weirded Sirius out to see the cold-hearted bat in anything besides his usual black robes. 

""Now then, what shall we buy first?"" 

Heading inside, the twins couldn't keep still as they looked left to right to see the different stores and how big it was. Of course, it wasn't as impressive as the magic they've seen the past few days, but it was amazing nonetheless. 

Looking at the provided map on the wall, the three men gazed at the map and kept a mental note of where to go. Starting on the lobby floor, they went off to the first store. Heading inside, Sirius and Severus were quick to grab clothes off the rack as Remus pushed the twins to the changing room. Taking it all to the changing room, one of the staff members stopped the two men- 

""I'm sorry, sirs, but you aren't allowed to bring so many clothes into the changing room-""

""Oh, I do apologize, but surely you can allow us to bring a few more? It's my first time buying clothes for my pups. Surely a goddess like you can answer my selfish prayer?"" Putting on his infamous charm, the staff member's cheeks brightened whilst letting out a shy chuckle. 

""O-Oh well..."" Severus and Remus had fought to urge to roll their eyes, but thanks to his cheesy remarks, they were allowed to bring more clothes and two large changing rooms to themselves. 

""We weren't sure what you'd like, so we brought anything that might look great on you."" Pushing the twins to the changing room, they took the offered clothes and closed the curtain. 

After a few minutes, Harry was the first to appear. Sirius began clapping and mumbling about how cute Harry looked. Harry wasn't sure if it suited him, changed into a simple white button-down and dark blue overalls.

""Rose? Are you alright in there?"" Remus called.

""U-Uhm y-yes..."" Peeking her head out of the curtain, she was quite flushed. 

""What's the matter, pup?""

""... I-Is it okay for me to wear this?"" 

""You can wear anything you want, Rose. I'll make sure to get it for you."" Smiling, she hesitated before pulling back into the changing room and drawing the curtain open. 

Changed into a black skirt & red sweater, Remus and Sirius cooed over how adorable she looked, but Severus hadn't said a word. He stared at the girl before telling her to try on something else. Worried about disappointing, she quickly rushed back inside, making Sirius snarl at Severus. Remus distracted Harry with other clothes to try on whilst Sirius lowered his voice to avoid the twins to hear.

""You could've at least complimented her-!"" 

""It didn't look good on her, nor did they fit her small frame.""

""Be more sensitive, you heartless-""

""D-Does it looks bad on me...?"" 

She changed into a yellow sundress with ribbon straps on her shoulder. With her red hair and small frame, it suited her. Sirius really hated saying that Severus was right, but the colors complimented her compared to the first one she wore. 

""No, pup. You look absolutely adorable."" Smiling at the praise, Severus asked Rose to come over, and he tied a yellow ribbon into her hair as a hairband. 

""There."" Looking at the mirror, she happily smiled and thanked Severus. He smiled back, saying he's glad she likes it. 

""This will look wonderful on you both."" Remus pulled out two sets of clothes- they were matching. 

""Oh-! Oh! With this!!"" Waving two berets, he handed them to the twins and ushered them to go try it on. With another change of clothes, they revealed the clothing, and three men all agreed.

ADORABLE.

This fashion show lasted for about an hour until one of the staff members had said they were taking too long and other people needed the changing room. Ready to retaliate about still needing it, Remus apologized and mentioned that they'd buy everything they've picked out. 

With a handful of bags, they exited the store and moved to the next store. 

After another hour of trying out new clothes in another store, the twins were depleted of energy. Waiting for Sirius to finish paying, Harry and Rose waited with Severus and Remus outside. 

""Why don't you all head on over to the next shop? I'll help Sirius with the bags."" The next stop was shoes. 

""Hello sir, how may I help you today?""

""My-"" Looking down at the twins, he pondered how to word their relationship. ""My... wards require new shoes.""

""Of course, is there anything specific you need?""

""To start, I think sneakers.""

""Very well. Do you know their shoe size?"" Shaking his head, the employee asked the twins to take a seat, take off their shoes, and place their foot on a template. Measuring their size, the man began showing Severus several selections of sneakers to choose from. 

""This is one of our best-sellers; it was from the fall collection last year.

This one is second in line in the best sellers-""

""Harry, Rose, try them on."" Trying on the new shoes, Severus asked them to try moving around to feel any discomfort. Walking around a few steps, Harry and Rose smiled at the new shoes. It was so comfortable and new-! Not only did they get new clothes today but they were also getting shoes! Who would've thought?

""What do you think, Rose?"" Harry pointed to his shoes making Rose smile and nod. 

""Great-!""

""Rose's looks great too!"" 

""Rose."" Scurring over to Severus, he hed out mary jane pumps and flats. ""How about these?""

""F-For me?"" 

""Of course. A young lady as yourself should have many pairs."" Partically seeing the joy radiate out of her, he smiled. ""Why don't you try them on?""

""Y-Yes sir-!"" Taking the shoes, she quickly changed and stared lovingly at the shoes. To think a mere pair of shoes can make her so happy... 

Picking out a few more pairs for the twins, Remus and Sirius joined them right after Severus paid for the shoes. Moving onto the next store, they continued on their shopping spree for the twins until the late afternoon. Walking around all day and trying on different clothes and shoes, they twins were exhausted. By their 12th store, Harry and Rose were dragging their feet as their eyes were struggling to stay open. 

""Perhpas we should end it here today."" Remus suggested.

""Let's finish with this last store and we can head on home. 

Think you can make it, pup?"" Harry lazily nodded as Rose said a slurred yes. 

""How about you stay with them and I'll get the things we still need. It's bed sheets and pillow cases."" Remus suggested as Sirius and Severus picked up the twins into their arms. 

""Alright."" 

""I won't be long."" Rushing into the store, Severus patted Rose back trying to get her to fall asleep. 

""I'm sorry sir...""

""No apologies needed. It's normal you'd be tired, do not worry about it and close your eyes."" Rose glanced over to Harry to see Sirius was doing the same thing as Severus. 


'Today was fun...'



'It was... wish we can do it again. Do you think we can do it again...?'



'I hope so... *yawn*'



'Rose... look. A black dog...'


'Huh?' Tiredly looking around, she spotted the dog, Harry was talking about. It was a black dog plush displayed on the store front. Next to it was a doe with a flower crown resting on it's head. 


'It's so cute...'


Struggling to their drowsiness, they hadn't realized they were now speaking out loud. Mumbling about a black dog and a doe, Sirius and Severus glanced at one another. Rose began mumbling how cute and cuddly they looked, the two men looked behind to see what they were talking about. A black dog and a doe plush. 

""Do you remember when Dudley gave us his old bear?""

""Our first toy... but he ripped it."" Rose's words were slurring as Harry was yawning more. 

""mmh, Aunt Petunia... *yawn*- she said we... *yawn* ""

""freaks... don't deserve... 

... we made... toys with... the scraps...""

""*yawn* Yeah... Uncle... burned... them-"" Harry was out like a light. Brushing through Harry's hair, Sirius whispered for him to sleep tight as Rose's vision was getting blurry.

""Sir...thank you for... today-"" Given into the slumber, the last thing she hears is- 'You'd only ask.'

 

~~

~~

 

Rose was first to open her eyes. Sitting up, she rubbed her eyes and looked around to see she was back in her room with Harry. The light was shinning through the window- it was morning...

It was morning-!

Panicking that they slept all day, she turned to wake Harry but was surprised to come face to face with flowers and antlers. Antlers? Shifting back a little, she realized she hadn't been holding Harry's hand, but a hoof. A hoof? Staring at what was hovering over her, she realized it was an animal- to be exact a doe plush. 

A doe plush...

But they were dreaming yesterday... how was it here? 

""Rose?"" Peeking over the doe's head, she gently pushed the plush away to see Harry had a black dog in his arms. 

""Harry... black dog..."" Pointing at the plush, he sleepily looked down to see the plush. 

""A dog...?"" Staring at one another, they were confused. What were the animals they were dreaming about doing here? Did they make it appear with their freakiness? Were they still dreaming? 

""Harry? Rose? Are you awake?"" 

""Y-Yes...!"" Quickly pushing the plushies to the end of the bed, they sat up as Sirius entered the room.

""Morning pups.""

""M-Morning, sir...""

""Morning sir..."" 

""Oh... no Padfoot?"" Sadly smiling at the twins, they hesitated. 

""U-Uhm...""

""It's alright, I don't want to force you to do anything you aren't comfortable with. Let's take it slow."" Smiling at the twins, he ruffled their messy hairs. ""Do you like the gifts?""

""Gifts...?""

""Why, these guys, of course."" Pulling up the plushies to the twins, they stared at Sirius.

""This... is for us?""

""Of course. Do you like them?"" 

""I-I love it... t-thank you, sir..."" 

""Thank you very much..."" 

""Harry. Rose."" 

""Yes sir?"" 

""You'd only ask.

Anything you want to wear, eat, play, do- it can even be as ridiculous as asking for a cauldron filled with cauldron cakes-"" Giggling at the nonsensical request, Sirius stroked the top of their heads. 

""We only wish to give you the best and that you'd both be happy.""

To think someone like them were being treated with such kindness and love... they couldn't be any more grateful. Nodding, they both smiled with tears rolling down their cheeks. They've cried many times in the past but never have they felt such compassion towards them that it'd bring them to tears. Perhaps they truly can be happy...


""Happy birthday 7th, Harry. Rose."" 


Harry and Rose may be twins but they were completely different in a few ways. 

Sirius and Remus realize how Severus is soft towards the twins but more to Rose. 

Severus realizes how much he will miss the twins when they leave...

They have unexpected guests. Good or bad? Who knows...?


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          


Seven years old. 


Harry Jame Potter & Rose Lily Potter were officially seven years old. 

Waking up in the morning to a gift and congratulations on their birthday- it felt like a dream. Sirius had taken them downstairs to the dining room, and they were taken back by the spread laid out on the table with a large chocolate cake in the center. Seven candles with writing- 


Happy 7th Birthday, Harry, Rose. 


A chocolate cake with strawberries was for them. To think the very cake they had wished to have a small taste of was sitting at the table waiting for them. 

""Happy birthday, Harry, Rose."" Remus congratulated the twins as Severus patted their heads. 

""Happy birthday."" 

""For us...? Really?"" Harry asked.

""Of course. Only the very best for my godson and goddaughter."" Helping the twins onto their seats, the cake was pushed towards the twins, and the candles were lit. 

""Happy birthday, pups. Happy 7th birthday."" 

Choking out a small thank you, the twins were in tears. To think anyone would celebrate their birthday and be so nice to them was more than they deserved. Blowing out the candles, Sirius smiled and embraced the twins. 

""This is just the beginning, pups. I'll make sure we celebrate your birthday and holidays with you every year. No matter what. Ain't that right, Remus?""

""Of course. We'll make sure to take care of you both so much that you'll both get sick of us."" Chuckling, the twins couldn't hold back their tears. Hugging Sirius back, they wept into his shoulders. 

Ah... so this is what it was like to be loved...


It was so warm.


 

~~

~~

 

Through tears and joy, they all finished their hearty breakfast and slices of cake before going into the sitting room where two piles of gifts were waiting for the twins. They were happy enough with the kind words and cake but to receive so many gifts on top of that... 

They've only seen this many gifts whenever it was Dudley's birthday or Christmas. 


'I think there are more than Dudley's...'



'T-There's so many...'



'Is that all for us?'



'U-Uhm...' 


Walking over to the awaiting piles, Rose picked up the tag to see Harry's name. 'These are yours.'

'M-Mine?! B-but what about, Rose?' Picking up a gift from the opposite side, the tag read her name. 


'T-These are mine...'



'W-Wow...'


As they opened the gifts, their expressions had gotten brighter but immediately had darkened- handing the opened gifts to Sirius or Remus, the marauders had to convince the twins that the gifts were for them and theirs only. Nobody else. It took them a while to understand this...

Opening up their gifts, Severus noticed most of Rose's gifts were books. It may have been educational and good for her to start learning at her age, but no child would want books for their birthday. If anything, they'd want sweets, toys, clothes, or miscellaneous items. Glancing over at Harry, it was quite the opposite- clothes, toys, and even a child broom-!

Rose had stopped unwrapping her gifts and was staring at Harry- of course, she'd be upset, but the poor child was unable to say it out loud. Sitting beside Rose, she turned and smiled at the Potion's Master. 

""... Do you like your gifts?"" 

""O-Oh, y-yes! Very much."" 

""If you do not like anything, it's okay to tell me.""

""... No, sir. I'm okay; I truly do love the gifts. Truly-!"" Hugging the leather-bound book, she shined him another smile and gently set the book onto the book pile. Moving onto another gift, Severus glanced over to see Sirius beaming at Harry's blooming curiosity. 

""I-I can really fly on this?""

""I remember you flying on one I had gotten you for your first birthday. Of course, James had been making sure you don't fall. He was practically making sure to catch you every second. Lily had given me an earful saying you could've gotten hurt, and it was much too early for you to be playing quidditch.""

""Quidditch?"" Explaining the game to the boy as easily as he can, Remus had returned from the kitchen with drinks for everyone. 

Flicking the drinks to everyone, Remus noticed the large pile of books beside Rose. ""Is it only books?"" Hovering over her, she glanced behind and smiled while shaking her head. Pointing to the small pile behind the books, she showed the sweets she had received. 

""Surely you received other things..."" Remus was confused; he remembered picking out a few clothes to gift Rose.

""Oh, I still have three more."" Hoping for the best, Remus nodded to Rose. Hopefully, the remaining gifts weren't books... he'll have to talk to Sirius later.

The next two gifts were... books. The never-ending books. 

Hoping for the best for the last gift, she ripped the wrapping and the first thing they saw smooth surface with small gems embedded. It was looking good so far...

Taking the rest of the wrapping off- it was a black jewelry box. THANK MERLIN.

Stroking the smooth surface, Rose smiled at the initials etched in the center with a rose design around them. Unlatching the lock, she carefully opened the box, and a gentle tune began playing. It was so soothing and oddly nostalgic...

""Do you like it, Rose?"" Harry was staring at the box with fascination, and Sirius was smiling at Rose. Sitting in front of her, he explained the box had multiple secret compartments. Pressing on the small doe that was rotating, multiple drawers appeared on the side of the box, revealing accessories. 

""T-This is all for me?"" 

""Do you like it?"" 

""I-I do... thank you."" 

""I was honestly shocked, pup. I know you said you didn't need anything else, but were books really okay?"" Looking at the large piles of books beside her, Rose smiled and nodded.

""Yes-! I really do love them, thank you."" Seeing her so happy receiving books, Remus and Severus sighed in relief, but she looked so sad when she stared at Harry. Was she not jealous?

""Rose, you weren't jealous of Harry's gifts?""  Remus asked.

Tilting her head, confused by Remus' question, she chuckled and shook her head. ""I was talking with Harry; he was confused about that."" Pointing to the broom, Harry nodded. 

""it's true, sir...""

""As long as you aren't upset."" Remus smiled in relief, but did he hear that right? She and Harry spoke to one another? But they were silent the entire time... Did the twins have a way of communicating with one another? Was that possible? That was quite a rare gift...

""Rose. You said you and Harry spoke with one another, but I didn't see you talking to him directly."" Rose froze as she covered lips with her hands. How could she let such a thing slip-?! Even if she and Harry were a wizard and witch, there is no way they were as freaky as them.

""I-I'm s-sorry, s-sir... I-I...""

""S-Sir, w-we're sorry. W-We didn't mean to be freaky-! W-We're really sorry, p-please don't hurt Rose..."" Harry was begging Remus not to hurt Rose; the men haven't seen them panic this much since the first day they brought them here. To think he triggered a trauma without realizing it, Remus felt like a heartless fool.

""No. No, you aren't in trouble. Forgive me; I didn't mean to scare you both."" Speaking as calmly as possible, he was flustered as he tried to dry Harry's tears while Sirius and Severus were trying to calm Rose. 

""R-Really...?""

""Yes, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked it in such a careless manner."" Letting out a few hiccups, Remus was able to wipe away the last of his tears. ""It's just able to speak telepathically is a scarce gift.""

""Rare gift...?""

""Yes, extremely. Many have tried, but it's not something you can learn nor just do.""

""Perhaps, them being twins is a part of it."" Sirius said. 

""Perhaps. It's been nearly a century since we've heard of such an ability."" 

""But... aren't we freaky even if... we are a witch and wizard?"" 

""Not at all. You are both extraordinary."" Severus wiped away the stray tears from Rose's cheeks as she stared at him. It was hard to believe she and Harry were a wizard and witch but to think they thought of them as extraordinary- truly? 

""I've brought down the mood on your birthday; I'm sorry."" Nobody has ever apologized to them, but coming here- they've heard nothing but praise, encouragement, kind words, and the small number of apologies. Why would they apologize to them? It was she and Harry that was bad... wasn't it? No matter how many times they've told her and Harry, what they did wasn't their fault, nor should they think that way; it was impossible. They were freaks, they were bad, they were-

""Rose, do not go into that mindset."" Severus had cupped the girl's face shaking her out of her depressing thoughts. Startled to see Severus staring at her with such a sad expression, she muttered a small apology. 

Severus would retort back by saying she needn't apologize that she did nothing wrong, but he instead did that. He only leaned his forehead against hers and whispered words of encouragement. 

""You did well coming back. You aren't a freak; you are an extraordinary child. You and Harry both deserve much more than you think."" 

He's only done this a few times with Rose whenever she had a nervous breakdown from remembering something traumatic or screaming from a nightmare. It was so foreign to Rose- hearing such words of encouragement and kindness. She had first ignored it and let the words go through her ear and out the next. She felt she wasn't meant for such things, but she grew selfish. It calmed her and gave her the illusion that she was truly wanted and loved; slowly, she began believing it. She still had her doubts, but she didn't doubt one thing- Sirius, Remus, and Severus truly cared for her and Harry. 

 

~~

~~

 

""She seems to be more prone to breakdowns compared to Harry..."" Remus said, glancing over at the twins. 

""She was able to adapt to her surroundings faster than Harry as well, but Harry is more open."" Sirius agreed. 

""They may be twins, but they are still different."" Severus added. 

""... I hate to admit but, you handle Rose very well."" Sirius glanced over at the Potions Master. Severus raised a brow at the shaggy man- Sirius had always said that in such a joking manner, he hadn't believed him. To think he'd hear him say it with genuine sadness. 

""That may be so, but you both handle them both well, unlike me. Po- Harry..."" Clearing his throat, he sighed- he really had to fix that bad habit of his. Harry was merely a child; he wasn't James... ""-Harry is very wary with me. He hesitates to speak with me unless Rose initiates the conversation first.""

""Yes, well... we have noticed you and Rose seem to have bonded better than Remus and I."" Why was he so caught up with Rose and him- oh... OH HO. Now, this was interesting. Sirius Black. He was jealous that Rose was more comfortable speaking with Severus Snape~ Who would've thought such a day would come...

""Perhaps you should try and interact with her more. What will you do when they move to your residence next week-"" 

Move... right, the twins were officially going to be under the care of Sirius Black, their Godfather... The Potter twins won't be in this house any longer. This was just temporary...

""Have you spoken to them about this? They have just gotten used to being here."" 

""Not yet. We were planning to this evening."" 

""Surely you must be overjoyed to get rid of the Potter twins~"" Sirius teased Severus but was shocked to see Severus' expression soften to such disappointment. Has the Dark Lord return- Sirius and Remus saw so many spectacular moments of Severus Snape, this cold, heartless snake. Who would've thought he'd look so disappointed about the twins leaving... 

""You can always visit them, and I'm sure we'll need days when we ask you to take care of them. You needn't look so disappointed; it's not like you'll never see them again."" Remus smiled, startling Severus, and Sirius groaned. 

""Your eyes must be going."" Severus glared at the werewolf as his indifferent expression was back. Remus really wanted to laugh at this man, but perhaps it'd be best not to.

""Visit, don't visit, honestly- I couldn't care less, knowing what you're like."" Sirius rolled his eyes, making Remus sigh. Severus and Sirius needed to be more tolerant of one another, but that'll never happen with their constant bickering... 

As Sirius and Severus glared at one another whilst throwing insults at one another, Remus noticed Harry was running over to him. Smiling at the boy, he leaned down to ask what was the matter, but Harry didn't have enough time to explain. Pointing to the sitting room, he couldn't say a word when Remus saw the green fire illuminate the room, startling Rose. Remus thought it was perhaps Poppy or McGonagall, but instead, it was a familiar voice he wasn't sure he'd be happy to hear, he or Sirius. 

""I wasn't aware of Severus having a child."" The tall man with long pale blonde hair raised a brow at Rose whilst his wife leaned down, smiling at her. 

""Godness, she's adorable. Hello, sweetie, what's your name? Oh, is Severus around?"" 

Rose sat on the ground, frozen, staring at the new strangers hovering over her. She hadn't been told people would be coming over; who were they? They looked beautiful, but the man's gaze frightened her. Was he here to hurt her? Terrified, she began shaking, and tears were gathering in her eyes; she was scared.

""Goodness, Lucius. What did I say about your gaze towards children, our child may be used to it, but it frightens other children-!"" Hitting her husband's arm, the man muttered a small apology and gazed down at the trembling child. How should he try and calm the child? Slightly flustered, he rummaged through his coat and smiled to himself, taking out the content. Slowly kneeling to the child, he held out a nicely wrapped box. 

""I do apologize, my child. I hadn't meant to scare you; perhaps you can forgive me with this?"" Holding out the box, Rose stared at the box and the man. His gaze wasn't scary anymore... he looked nice? 

Swallowing in her fear, she blinked and let the tears fall without realizing how much she was holding in. 

""Lucius-!""

""I-I didn't mean to-"" Panicking in thinking he made Rose cry, a small pair of grey eyes popped out behind the woman. He walked towards the girl carefully, not wanting to startle the girl, and held out his handkerchief. Confused why he was handing her his expensive-looking cloth, she stared at him confused. 

Holding out the handkerchief again, he told her to take it. Doing as she was told, the boy picked up the box his father had dropped and opened it revealing small chocolate bonbons. Holding out the open box, he smiled at Rose. ""Try them. They're delicious.""

This child was nice to her? No other kid was ever nice to her or Harry, not to she knew of.

""LUCIUS MALFOY-!! DID YOU MAKE ROSE CRY?!"" Harry ran to Rose as the blonde child moved away and stared at the twins. 

""I had thought I smelled a mutt... oh fabulous. Both of you."" 

""Nice to see you too, Lucius."" Remus smiled, but his words said the opposite. He wasn't happy to see him either nor see Rose crying. 

""How unexpected..."" Severus said with much joy he can muster.

""Apologies, Severus, but Draco wanted to see his Godfather very much."" Narcissa apologized to Severus, who said nothing but nodded, understanding the sudden appearance.

""... Hello Sirius.""

""Narcissa."" Distant family reunion. What fun. 

""So, Severus. Do pray tell, who is the lucky witch who had caught that cold heart of yours."" Lucius smiled. 

""What do you mean?""

""I know we hadn't seen you in a few years, but to think we'd come back to see children of your own. Quite the surprise."" 

""You should've told me-! Especially since you had a daughter, she's adorable~"" Narcissa was ecstatic for Severus.

""A moment. 

You are wrong in both speculations... Rose-""

""Rose? Oh, what a fitting name for her, her hair is just as red as a rose!"" Narcissa had always wanted a daughter. To think she'll have the chance with Severus' daughter.

Sighing in frustration, Sirius broke the ice, ""Harry and Rose are mine-! They are my god-children."" Glaring at Lucius, the blonde scoffed at the statement.

""Surely not... they are much too adorable to take after your shaggy appearance."" 

""It's true. Sirius is their Godfather because they are James and Lily's children."" The room went silent.

""What?""


""That is Harry James and Rose Lily Potter."" 


""...""

""...""

""Well then...""

""Well...""

""I guess we've become an aunt and uncle-!"" Narcissa happily stated. 

""Excuse me-?!"" Sirius was baffled. 

Narcissa only smiled at Sirius as Severus sighed and went into the kitchen to make tea for his new guests. 

Apologies if it kinda rushed- running on 2 hours of sleep and its 3am, ah ha ha... really wanted to finish this chap.

*(Rest in Peace to Helen McCrory. We raise our wands to you.)

Meeting Draco, Rose isn't sure how to act. Harry, on the other hand, is a natural and gets along with Draco. 

Draco finds the twins a little odd but nice. 

Lucius and Narcissa are filled in about why the twins are with Severus. They see the aftermath of what they've been through. 

An odd family reunion and new family members for the Potters-!

Apologies for the long wait-!

""Nobody asked for you. Time for you to leave."" 

""I do believe I'm here to see Severus, not you, fleabag."" 

Ignoring Sirius' glares, Severus served the tea whilst Narcissa watched her son interact with the twins. Smiling proudly that her son was such a gentleman, she hoped they'd all get along. Glancing over at Severus, she noticed he would glance over at the twins whilst serving the tea and sat down. My, my, he was never such the type even with Draco. Who could've thought he would change so much with the Potter twins? How adorable. 

""Is this only a social call, or is there other business you've come to rely upon me."" 

""Always with business with you, Severus. 

But to answer your question- no, we've only come to see you."" Sipping the tea, Lucius sighed in content. 

""Not to be rude, but how did you come to live with the children?

Sirius? Remus?"" Narcissa asked. Severus placed his cup down and glanced over at the two marauders. Remus and Sirius were hesitant; should they tell them? Sure, the two of them weren't exactly on great terms with Lucius, but it was the same with Severus. Yet, here they were sitting at Severus' dining table, drinking tea with the Malfoys of all wizards and witches. It wasn't such a huge secret, but, perhaps, they can trust them just as they did with Severus- he had definitely shown them a new side of him they've never seen except when Lily was alive. 

""I ask that you both be careful with Harry and Rose. They've... been through a lot."" Just remembering how they met Rose and found Harry that first day, Sirius felt his blood boil in rage. 

""Where to start..."" Severus sighed as he thought about what he should start with. 

Whilst the adults were all talking amongst themselves in the dining room, the children in the sitting room were in complete silence- well, the twins were as Draco introduced himself. 

""Draco Malfoy. It's nice to meet you."" Holding out his hand, the twins looked at one another. Harry hesitantly shook his hand. 

""... h-hello."" Harry shyly said as Rose nodded. Draco tilted his head to the side; he was confused. He's never met other kids like them; they were much too quiet. 

""I didn't know Uncle Sev had children.""

""Uncle-?""

""-Sev?""

How fascinating, they finished each other sentences- well, words. Obviously, they were twins, from the unruly hair, the green eyes, the glasses, and the scar on the same spot on their forehead. Only, the girl's hair was bright red- he's only seen such hair with the Weasley's. They were such odd purebloods, and their hair wasn't pleasant to look at, but the girl's hair wasn't such an ugly colour as theirs. 

""U-Uhm, I'm H-Harry. Harry Potter, and this is my sister, Rose.""

""N-Nice to meet you... Malfoy.""

""You can just call me Draco."" Smiling at Rose, she nodded in thanks. They really were strange, especially Rose. 

""You said, sir, is your Uncle?"" Harry asked.

""He's actually my godfather, but I call him uncle. It's easier.

But... why do you call Uncle Sev, sir? Isn't Uncle Sev your father?"" The twins shook their heads frantically. 

""N-no. H-he's not.""

""H-he saved us..."" 

""Saved you?"" Hesitant to answer, Draco, although young, knew he shouldn't pry into it. If there is anything his father taught him is not to be a nosy brat. Looking around, he saw the broom leaning against the couch. 

""Wow, you got a broom? I don't have one yet, but Father says he'll get me one next year when the new one comes out. I've only taken lessons.""

""O-Oh... Uhm, I got it as a gift. D-Did you want it?"" Was he serious? Why would he give away his gift? 

""But it's your present...I wouldn't take it from you...""

""O-Oh, right..."" 

""I-If you don't want the broom, you can have one of my books instead..."" Rose said, hoping to appease Draco if he grew angry with them, but Draco only stared at them blankly. 

The twins were really odd...

""O-Oh! We have cake! Do you want a slice?"" Harry asked, remembering the huge cake they had leftover.

""Oh, were you celebrating?"" 

""I-It's our birthday."" Harry shyly smiled. 

""Your birthday...?"" 

""Y-yeah, we got lots of food and chocolate cake with strawberries, and we got so many gifts-! We never had them before, so we were really happy."" Rambling about earlier, Rose smiled and nodded. 

'Never had them before? But why?' The more Draco listened to the twins, the more he found it odd. Perhaps he was just thinking too much into this. 

""Do you know how to fly?"" 

""N-not yet... uhm-"" Embarrassed, Harry twiddled with his fingers, but Draco smiled and held out the broom to him. 

""I can teach you-! Father taught me himself!"" Harry's eyes lit up, smiling. 

""R-Really?""

""Sure!"" Smiling back, the two boys walked over to a more open area in the sitting room whilst Rose stood there with her book in hand. Watching the two boys converse so naturally, she was happy for Harry. She could never talk with anyone her age without making them think she was weird or a freak. Thinking it best to leave them alone, she threw her new book onto the couch, climbed up with much difficulty, and read her book in silence. That is until she flinched at the sudden shriek she heard in the dining room. Glancing over at the table, Narcissa smiled and apologized to Rose before turning back to her peers. Rose went back to her book with much confusion.  

""THOSE WRETCHED MUGGLES-!"" Whispering harshly, Lucius folded his arms and asked. 

""Surely you taught them a lesson?""

""They'll pay their price in prison."" Sirius said bitterly.

""Prison is much too good for utter trash like them! How could they-?! To a child!?!"" Narcissa was fuming just thinking about what she was told. Children were so precious, especially in the wizarding world, child abuse was never tolerated and paid a heavy sentence to those who did such a thing. The poor dears... to think they've been through so much. It hurt her heart. 

""It's a good thing you took them away from such monsters. The audacity to harm children like that..."" Lucius truly was enraged to hear this. 

""If there's anything I regret is leaving them in one piece..."" 

""How are they faring?"" Narcissa asked. 

""Better than I expected, but of course, we have our challenges with them..."" Remus chuckled as Sirius groaned into his arms. 

""Harry is a bit more open towards us, but Rose... she's quite closed off.""

""You surely didn't expect the child to just open up about everything and anything to you, did you?"" Lucius raised a brow at Sirius, who glared at the man. 

""Of course not-! It's just..."" Heavily sighing, he gestured to Severus.

""She is more comfortable speaking with me than those two."" 

""You-?! Really...?"" Lucius smirked at the thought. Who would've thought?

""You needn't make it sound like it's such an impossible thing..."" Severus glared at Lucius while sipping his tea. The blonde man couldn't help but chuckle. 

""I just find it hard to believe you aren't so soft towards Draco.""  

Hiding his annoyance behind his teacup, the Malfoys chuckled. Hearing giggles and small shouts in the sitting room, the adults were relieved to hear the children were getting along. Wanting to check up on the children, Remus excused himself to go to the lavatory. Peering into the sitting room, Harry learned how to ride his broom while Draco gave him instructions on how to do so. Remus was glad that Harry was smiling as he should, but he didn't see Rose with them. 

Looking around, he saw her bright red hair peeking over the couch. ""Rose?"" 

Looking up, she saw Remus staring at her worriedly. Smiling at the man, she marked her page and closed the book turning to the man. ""Yes, sir?"" Taking a seat beside Rose, he glanced at the boys. ""Love, why aren't you playing with the boys?""

""O-Oh... Uhm, I thought they'd prefer to play by themselves.""

""Did they say they didn't want to play with you?"" Shaking her head frantically, she yelled a no. Apologizing for the sudden rise in her voice, Remus chuckled. 

""Harry gets along with people... better than I.""

So she knew. Perhaps they had made it obvious? Hopefully, they didn't pressure Rose to feel this way...

""Do you not like talking to other people?""

""... I don't know how, I try, but- 

Harry and I used to go to school, but not together. Aunt Petunia didn't want people to know there were two freaks in her house..."" 


That woman...


""-Harry would go to school more than I did, but whenever I went, everyone would say I've become weird...""

""Well, I honestly think they were wrong about that. So what if you're weird? Everyone is. I doubt there isn't anyone who isn't just a little weird.

Why haven't you seen Sirius? He's all kinds of weird."" Giggling at Remus's words, he grinned. What a relief to see Rose smiling a little more. 

""Do you hate Draco? Was he mean to you?""

""N-No, but... they said they were going to practice flying, and I don't know anything about that...

I only like to read; other people find it weird...""

""Nonsense. Reading is a wonderful hobby; you can learn so much and not to mention the imagination that goes into some of them."" 

""I...It's okay to like reading?""

""Of course. I, myself, like to read a book whenever I can, especially before I go to sleep."" 

""C-Could I do that too?"" 

""Would you like me to read you a story before you sleep every night?""

""R-Really?"" 

""Whenever, you'd like."" Rose beamed and thanked Remus. 

""R-Rose-! L-Look!"" Looking behind, Remus chuckled. 

""Look at you, Harry. A natural, aren't you?""

""D-Draco taught me!"" Smiling, Draco grinned triumphantly. 

""Of course, I was taught by the best and by Father himself."" 

""My, my, aren't you the teacher."" Narcissa chuckled, seeing the boys so happy about Harry's successful broom ride. 

""Mother-! Look! I was able to teach him how to ride a broom!"" Floating back to the ground, he slid off the broom and smiled at his first successful lesson. 

""I see that you did so well, my Draco."" Praising the boy, the twins stared at their interaction. They'd be lying if they said they weren't slightly jealous of such affection; they've only seen such action with their aunt and cousin. Severus and Sirius weren't oblivious to the twins' stare. 

""Just like your old man, pup! You're a natural!"" Sirius praised. 

""Hehe."" Shyly thanking Sirius, Remus patted Rose's head, not wanting to leave her out. 

""Do you think you can manage to fly around the sitting room?"" Sirius asked. Harry hesitantly stared at the broom but nodded nonetheless. He was curious himself. Starting slow, he mounted on his broom again and lifted off the ground. Moving slowly towards Sirius, he gripped his broom and began getting the hang of it. Though he wasn't that high off the ground, he began picking up the speed little by little and flew throughout the sitting room with ease. Draco moved closer to Rose to see Harry and grinned to see Harry doing so well. 

""Try and cut through the dining room and hallways! Be careful!"" Sirius could see Harry practically radiating happiness. 

Zooming through with ease, he began laughing. This was so much fun; it felt so freeing and thrilling-! Harry wished he could fly every day if he could. Lost in his happiness, he didn't see the wall and the frantic call of his name.

""Harry-!"" 

""Harry, watch out!!"" 

""HARRY!"" Looking up, he immediately made a sharp right but crashed right into Rose and to the couch. Draco managed to move away just in time. 

""HARRY?! ROSE?!"" Sirius ran over in a panic whilst Remus and Draco helped the twins up. 

""Are you alright?""

""I-I'm sorry, sir...

Are you okay?"" Facing Draco, he nodded. He couldn't believe that she was asking if he was okay when she was the one who was crashed into. 

""That was very dangerous, Harry; you mustn't be distracted like that. "" Remus said.

""I'm sorry..."" 

""You okay, Harry...?"" Rose groaned, rubbing her nose. 

""I-I'm fine. Oh, I'm sorry, Rose, you okay?"" 

""I think so-""

""Rose-! Blood!"" Draco yelled. 

""Rose, hold still."" Sirus pressed a handkerchief to Rose's nose, she looked down to see a few drops of blood on her hand. Oh, she was wondering what was so warm on her hand... 

""I'm okay, sir. I only need to wipe it away."" 

""Rose, love, please look up."" 

""I've had them before; it goes away in a day or two."" Saying it in such a nonchalant manner shocked Narcissa and Lucius. What child thinks nothing of a nosebleed? 

""Rose, my Lil bud, it'll be bad for you if we don't treat your nosebleed-"" Narcissa took the handkerchief from Sirius' hand, ""It could be very dangerous for a child like you."" 

""Aunt Petunia always said it because I was bad..."" 

""But you aren't a bad child. You are a wonderful young lady. And a wonderful child such as yourself needs to be treated.

If you don't, then I'm sure, Sirius, here will die of a heart attack."" Worriedly looking at Sirius, she nodded. 

""O-Okay.""

""That's a good girl."" Tilting her head as told, Severus took Narcissa to the nearby kitchen sink. 

 

~~

~~

 

""There, we are. How do you feel?"" Narcissa asked. 

Rose felt slightly light-headed; she was sure she might fall asleep if she stood up any longer. Should she tell them? They already took care of her nosebleed; she didn't want to bother them any longer-

""Rose, you're looking slightly pale..."" Severus held his hand against her forehead. ""No fever...""

""... I'm okay, sir.""

""Are you sure, sweetheart?"" Narcissa was sure Rose would drop to the ground any second.

""I...""

""Rose."" Crossing his arms and staring at Rose, she had remembered- right... she needn't put up a facade. 

""M' a little... dizzy."" With a curt nod, he held out his arms to Rose. Picking her up, he took Rose upstairs. 

""Thank you for telling me the truth.""

""... Yes, sir.""

""Rose, you must not hide your pain no matter how small it is. It'll make everyone worry.""

""I-I'm sorry, sir.""

""No, you did well."" Patting her back as a job well done, Rose laid her head against his shoulder. Arriving at her room, the door opened, and he set her down on the bed before taking out his wand. Muttering a spell, the hearth was lit and began warming the room. 

""Rest now-""

""Sir...?""

""Yes?""

""... Is Harry in trouble?""

""It's best you focus on yourself, Rose.""

""...But-""

""I promise he isn't in trouble; it was only an accident. It can happen.""

""... Truly?""

""Yes.""

""...Thank you, sir.""

""Sleep."" Pulling the covers to her chin, he stroked her hair to coax her to sleep. ""One of us will come to check up on you later.""

""Yes, sir..."" Falling fast asleep, Severus sighed. She must've been quite tired, yet she pretended she was fine; no, she did well this time. Although he made her give in to saying how she truly felt, it was good progress. 

Flicking the curtains close and blowing out the candles, he quietly left the room to join back with the others. Walking downstairs, Harry ran up to the professor in a panic. Back on the verge of tears, he asked about Rose and began apologizing that he didn't mean to hurt her nor cause trouble; Severus calmed the boy by telling him that she was fine and only resting now. It still didn't stop Harry from letting his tears spill; he felt horrible. He never meant to hurt Rose as they did... they were right. He was a bad child- a freak-

""Harry."" Glancing over his shoulder, Sirius smiled and took out his handkerchief to wipe away his tears. ""It was only an accident; you can get hurt while playing. It's normal, but it's also my fault; we should've gone outside instead. 

So don't be so hard on yourself."" 

""B-But... what if Rose hates me...?""

""I don't think she'll ever hate you, pup."" If there's anything he's noticed about the twins was how protective they were of one another. They were always quick to save the other by putting themselves on the line. 

""B-But...""

""Harry. Do you know what Rose asked me before I left?"" Shaking his head, Severus smiled. 

""She asked if you were in trouble.""

""Me?""

""She was worried you'd be in trouble and asked me not to punish you but her instead."" She never said the last few words, but the way she talked to Severus earlier, he wouldn't have been surprised if she said such a thing. 

""B-but Rose wasn't the bad one-! I-I-!""

""That's right, she didn't do anything wrong, nor did you.""

""...""

""You know..."" Narcissa cut into the conversation and smiled at Harry, ""-I've heard that the best way to someone's heart is through their stomach.""

???

Chuckling, Sirius rolled his eyes. ""Why don't we bake something for Rose when she wakes up? I'm sure she'll be delighted. Is there anything she likes?

You don't mind if we use the kitchen, do you, Severus?"" Shaking his head, he didn't mind if the kitchen was used as long as the children weren't near the stove or oven by themselves. 

""Chocolate... and strawberries...""

""Well then, why don't we make them for her?"" Helping Harry to his feet and wiping away the last of his tears, Harry went into the kitchen with Narcissa. 

""I'll help too, mother!"" Draco ran after the two and Narcissa happily accepted. 

""Surely, Narcissa could've done everything easily in a minute with her magic-"" Remus was quick to hit Sirius on the back of his head.

""Read the room."" 

Ignoring the bickering men, Severus walked into the kitchen to help Narcissa. Lucius and Narcissa were whispering to one another whilst Draco apologized to Harry for getting him into trouble. Wondering what the Malfoys were up to, Lucius had grabbed his attention. Asking he needs his help and grinned, Severus sighed and followed the pale blonde man. What were they up to? 

 

~~

~~

 

""Harry...?"" Mumbling out her brother's name, she opened her eyes only to see her doe plush hovering over her. Sitting up still half-awake, she stared at the walls trying to remember why she was asleep. It was nighttime already; she slept for a while. Right, she was feeling dizzy from earlier- but the bigger question was, is Harry okay? Rubbing her eyes, she untangled herself from the covers and grabbed her doe. 


'Oh, right... you don't have a name...'


Feeling bad to call her doe merely 'doe,' Rose pondered over what to name her new friend. After all, it was her precious friend, so she needed to find a perfect name for her. Lost in her thoughts, she didn't hear the door open and her name being called.


'Maybe... Rosie? No...



Uh... Beauty? ... No.



Uhmmm.... mmh.....'


""Rose?""

""A-Ah!!"" Startled, she jolted back and fell to the ground with a small shriek.

""R-Rose?!""

""M-M'kay..."" Rubbing the back of her head, her eyes popped over the bed to see Draco and Narcissa staring at her. Narcissa was quick to help the poor dear back onto the bed. 

""Are you sure? That was a nasty fall."" Inspecting her head just in case, Rose nodded; she was fine. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.""

""Why are you apologizing? I scared you and made you fall-!"" Draco was lost for words. Why would she apologize for something he did? The twins were truly odd.

""U-Uhm..."" 

""Draco."" Hearing his mother's warning tone, he apologized, as did Rose. ""Rose, sweetie, you did nothing wrong. You shouldn't apologize for something you didn't do.""

""I'm sor- Uhm..."" Rose was confused. Shouldn't she apologize? 

""I'm sorry for making you get hurt."" Draco said.

""What?""

""Earlier... you got hurt because of me."" Embarrassed, he was fiddling with his fingers. Rose tilted her head; why was he apologizing? He was only teaching Harry how to fly... he didn't do anything wrong.

""It's not your fault...""

""T-Then you aren't mad?"" Shaking her head, Draco beamed. ""We can still be friends?""

Friends? Did he want to be friends with her? But he was Harry's friend. Harry was a much better choice than she was. She wasn't like Harry; he knew how to talk to people better than she did. All she liked was books and... well she wasn't sure what else she liked...

""But you're Harry's friend...""

""We can all be friends."" Did she think that he can only be Harry's friend? 

""Really...?""

""Yeah-!""

""But... I'm weird and boring...""

""Says who?"" Draco sneered at the thought. Rose was so nice. Who would say such mean things to her?

""Everyone..."" 

""Well-! I like you and want to be your friend!"" Narcissa was surprised, although she raised Draco- he tended to be quite judgemental towards others, especially other children thinking they weren't good enough for him. She was worried he'd not like the twins or say something that'd hurt their feelings. To think he'd be so nice to them... she couldn't help but smile at how adorable her son was.

Rose stared at Draco as he held out his hand, slightly flushed. Really? He did? Rose was a little dumbfounded, but she couldn't help but smile. 

""Thank you...""

""Rose. Lil bud, in this situation, you say yes. I'd like to be friends with you too."" Narcissa chuckled. 

""O-Oh-!"" Grabbing Draco's still offered hand, she shook vigorously, nodding her head. Narcissa was trying not to laugh out loud, Draco grinned. 

""Where's Harry?"" 

""Oh, well~."" 

""Rose?"" Right on cue, Harry's head poked into the room. 

""Harry-!"" Happy to see her twin, Harry shyly looked to the floor before retreating. ""Harry?""

Silent for a moment, Rose began worrying. Was he hurt? Ready to climb off the bed, she crawled to the edge of the bed, but Harry had entered the room with a small tray. On it was a strawberry tart and hot chocolate. 

""Forgive me?"" Sadly staring at Rose while holding the tray up to her, she couldn't help but chuckle.

""For me?"" Nodding his head, she thanked him and said it was fine. It was only an accident, and she knows Harry didn't mean to hurt her. Harry shyly smiled at his twin.

""Let's eat this together."" Breaking a small piece of the tart and offering it to Harry, he grinned. 

""Okay.""

It's finally time for the Potters to move in with Sirius and Remus.Rose and Harry settle into their new home. 

Severus wonders if his home has always felt so empty...

(A/N): Sorry for the short chap-!

It's been a few days since their first-ever birthday celebration and meeting the Malfoys. Harry and Rose were grateful for everything; so much has happened over the past few weeks. They had gotten used to staying with Severus, and to say they liked the scary-looking professor would be an understatement, but of course, Severus didn't know that. They didn't realize that staying with Severus was only temporary; after all, Sirius was their legal guardian, but for how long? Today was the day when they'd be living with Sirius and Remus- they should've been happy, so why were they slightly sad about it? 

""Harry. Rose. Are you ready?"" Sirius called out to the twins upstairs. Hearing their quick steps, they came to the bottom of the stairs with their friends in hand. 

""Have everything?"" Asking the twins, they nodded. With their friends in one hand and holding each other's hand, they were ready to go. 

""Are they ready?"" Remus asked.

""Yeah, are you?""

""I just spoke with Severus; he's taken their things to the house."" 

""Where is the old bat, anyway?""

""Right behind you, mutt."" 

""I can practically see your happiness radiating from that frown of yours. We're finally leaving your lair."" Clicking his tongue, Severus wanted to retort back with a sarcastic remark but seeing the twins staring at him; he stayed silent. Patting their heads, Severus opened his mouth to say something, but he was at a loss for words. What should he tell them- have a good life? I'll miss you? As if they'd miss a scary-looking person like him. Maintaining his usual demeanor, he removed his hands away from their heads. 

""As short as it was, I hope you both enjoyed your stay here.

I will see you both when you come to Hogwarts.""

It was quite bittersweet. It wasn't goodbye forever, just as Severus had said- they'll be meeting him in Hogwarts a few years from now, but they had just gotten used to living with Severus. They weren't sure why they were so sad, but they just were... 

Harry wasn't sure what to say, he kept opening his mouth to say something, but he couldn't voice his thoughts. Rose, too, was lost in thought, over-thinking; what should she say to him? Maybe she shouldn't say anything? Maybe he was thrilled to get rid of them now... maybe-

""Rose."" Snapping out of her thoughts, she was surprised to see Severus' forehead against hers. He was smiling... ""You needn't overthink at such a young age."" 

""...Yes, sir."" Leading the twins to the cold hearth, Remus began explaining to the twins how it worked.

""-Simple, isn't it?"" Remus held out the small bowl of floor powder to the twins. ""So to repeat, all you need to do is grab a handful & say the name of the place you want to travel to clearly.""

""We can travel with this?""

""Of course, unlike muggles, we get to place to place in an instant.""

""Perhaps because you are both still a little young, why don't we go together? Two at a time?"" Remus suggested. The last thing he wanted was for the twins to mispronounce their destination and end up lost. The twins agreed; they weren't the greatest at saying big words at the moment.

""Harry,"" Sirius called to the boy, and the two entered the hearth. ""Hold my hand tightly, pup."" Nodding, Sirius grinned and winked at Rose. ""See you soon, pup.

12 Grimmauld Place."" 

Throwing the powder onto the ground, green fire consumed them, and just like that, both- Sirius and Harry like the flames disappeared. Startled by the flames, Rose hid behind Remus's legs. It still made her flinch whenever she saw those green flames. 

""It's alright, love. It's completely harmless."" Holding out his hand to Rose, she took it but hesitated to move to the hearth. ""I promise, sweetheart, you won't be hurt.""

Nervous but trusting Remus, she nodded. ""Thank you again, Severus. Do come to visit Harry and Rose.""

""... I'm sure Black wouldn't like that."" 

""I doubt he'll be able to say anything."" Remus smirked as he glanced down at Rose. ""Ready, love?""

""U-Uhm, sir?"" Calling out to Severus, she ran over to the professor and tugged on his robes. Kneeling to face her, Rose cupped her hands around her mouth and whispered to Severus. 

""Thank you, Mr. Snape, for saving my brother and me. I'll miss you."" Shyly moving away, Severus stared blankly at the wall, not seeing Remus chuckling at his blank stare. Processing what Rose said, he was at a loss for words. 

""Rose, it's time to go."" Calling out to Rose, she bowed her head in thanks to Severus once more and ran back to Remus. Picking Rose into his arms and a handful of Floo powder, Remus bid Severus a farewell. 

""-Rose.""

""Y-Yes, sir?""

""... Stay well.""

""12 Grimmauld Place."" 

 

~~

~~

 

Opening her eyes, Rose felt her stomach flip; it felt like the time she and Harry had apparated to the mall. The pain wasn't as bad as the first time, but she felt she may hurl. Remus gave Rose a moment to let her stomach settle before stepping out of the hearth. 

""Alright?"" Nodding, Remus had her do a few breathing exercises before he let her down. 

""You took quite a while.""

""We were saying our last goodbyes."" 

""With him? That bat actually said farewell?"" 

""Well, not in so many words to me."" Glancing down at Rose, Sirius's mouth shaped an 'o' in understanding. 

As Sirius and Remus continued to talk amongst themselves, Rose took a look around the new place she'll be staying for a while. It was quite spacious, dare she say bigger than Mr. Snape's place. It was quite dark like his place, and a few portraits were covered, how odd. Was that a common thing to do, to cover portraits?

The sitting room had luxurious furniture pieces that she's never seen before, the dining room next door had a very long table, and the kitchen was right behind it, divided by a large island. There were silverware, pots, and pans floating around the sink and into the cabinets- it was quite funny how this was now normal to see now. 

Walking out the dining room, past the sitting room was a long hallway and seemed like a study at the end of it. Perhaps it was Sirius'? At the start of the hallway, a large spiral staircase led to the second floor but looking up; she realized the house had what looked like 4 floors- how big was this place?

""Pup."" Scurrying back to Sirius, she hoped she wasn't so nosy by looking around the place. 

""S-Sorry, sir...""

""Don't be; it's a good thing you are looking around. It'll be where you stay from now on."" Smiling at Rose, she nodded. 

""Harry is upstairs in his room already. Time to show you yours.""

""My... room...?""

""Of course."" Leading the way up the stairs, Remus patted Rose's back to follow Sirius. 

Following the man up the stairs, he stopped at the second door on the left. On the door, there was a small plaque with roses and vines on the edges. Right in the center of it was her name. ""My name?"" Sirius grinned and opened the door; Rose walked into the room and couldn't stop herself from looking around in awe with her mouth open. 

It definitely was a huge difference from the cupboard she and Harry were forced to live in, but this space... it was way too big. She was sure this space was a big or most likely bigger than the sitting room downstairs. A large bed with clean sheets and pillows and sheer white curtains draping around it, bookcases filled to the brim, a large desk beside it, and mellow-yellow painted walls. It was wonderful.

""T-This is for me?""

""That right, pup.

I'm sorry about the decorating, it's quite barren, but I didn't want to do anything you won't like."" Rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment, Rose shook her head. 

""N-No-! I-I love it!"" 

""You can decorate it however you like, sweetheart. It's your room from now on.""

""From now on...?""

""Of course, this is your home now."" 

She didn't think they'd actually get to live here permanently; she had thought they'd... 


Home.


This was her home now. She and Harry's. 

""Rose!"" Harry came running in with a big smile on his face. ""We are next to each other!"" Grabbing her hand, he tugged her to his room next door. 

""W-Woah..."" Harry's room was a bit more decorated than Rose's but more colourful.

""My room is red! Isn't it cool?""

""Y-Yeah."" 

Unlike Rose's room, Harry's room was painted red and gold with intricate designs. The toys he had received on his birthday were overflowing in the chest at the other side of the room, a large rug laid underneath it with a few bookcases beside it. Looking around the room, even if Rose was a child, she knew that this room- a lot of thought was put into it...

""Is it alright, pup? I wasn't sure if you'd like the colours, but I had thought perhaps Gryffindor colours would suit you best."" 

""Thank you, sir-!"" Ruffling Harry's hair, Sirius smiled and began showing Harry where the things they had bought were. Rose clutched her dress and stared at the two- why did she feel so sad? It wasn't as if only one of them had been gifted a room.

She and Harry are together now; they met their god-father- someone who cares for them and won't hurt them. They got to live in a huge place and had received so many gifts. She should've been happy- satisfied with this yet...

Why did she feel lonelier than before? 

""Rose! Rose! Let's see your room!"" Harry's eyes sparkled with curiosity as ecstatic. Rose smiled and nodded, scurrying back to her room with Harry; Sirius followed happily to see his god-children smiling. 

She'll ignore that unsettling feeling; surely it's nothing...

Right?

 

~~

~~

 

It's been about three days since the twins had left his home and moved in with Sirius. Things had gone as they should've; Severus took in the twins,  allowed them to heal and rest in his home, afterward the twins would move in with Sirius, and they'd be put under his custody just as James and Lily had written it on their will. 

It was all according to plan; he shouldn't be feeling sad over something like this. It wasn't his first time seeing children come from abusive homes, he knew what it was like all too well, and he was merely doing what a good teacher should do. It was nothing more and nothing less- he may have been a bit softer to the twins because he remembered Lily's request back then, but the deed was done now. 

It's been a long day; Severus thought he'd finish his day with a cup of tea. The water began to boil as he set his cups down and poured the water into the awaiting teapot. Waiting a few minutes, he poured the tea and finished it with a splash of milk and a cube of sugar. 

'Oh right, they prefer a little sweeter.' Putting a few more sugar cubes into the two cups, the teacups floated to the dining room. 

Taking a seat, he held his teacup to take a sip but suddenly realized what he did. Looking over to his right, the two cups of tea sat in front of empty chairs. Sighing, he put down his cup. 


'I must be losing my mind...'  


Three cups of tea later, he decided to call it a night. Walking into his room, he noticed the hearth wasn't lit. Throwing a few wood logs, he had the fire lit before casting a warming charm on covers. The twins seemed to get cold quite easily, so he's been doing this for them every night- 

""..."" Staring at the empty bed, he was at a loss. To think he'd still be doing this after they had left.


'Although they were well-behaved and quiet...



this house seems quieter than before.'


How pathetic, Severus. Truly... 

Letting out another huff of irritation, he flicked his wand to the hearth, and the fire was extinguished. Leaving the room, he glanced back at the empty room and closed the door. 

 

Harry and Rose are now living with Sirius and Remus.

Every day is happier than the next for the twins, but each day Rose realizes Harry seems to be Sirius' favourite. 

Remus notices this and Rose becoming a bit more distant. 

Today's forecast seems to be thunderstorms...

(A/N): I suppose I should say strap yourself for some tears & cheesiness :DI re-wrote this about 6 times and I still don't really like it, but I wanted to update this story ASAP.

""Rose. Sweetheart, are you going to sleep all day?"" 

""Mmh..."" 

Peeking one eye open, Rose saw a blurry figure hovering over her. A warm hand brushed over her bangs and stroked the top of her hair. Rubbing her eyes, she looked up again to clearly see who it was. 

""O-Oh-!"" Sitting up, she mumbled out an apology to only hear a chuckle.

""Morning, love."" Remus smiled as Rose looked around. Her cheeks were flushed; she had forgotten again.

""M-Morning...

...Moony."" 

""It's almost noon; you must've been exhausted from yesterday."" Flicking his wand, the curtains around her bed and window separated. Light poured into her room as she could hear the water running next door. 

""Oh, it seems you have chocolate-covered strawberries today."" Holding up the small plate of strawberries, Rose's face beamed with happiness. ""But first, you need to brush your teeth."" Picking Rose out of bed; he walked into the bathroom with her. 

The past few days, Remus has been helping Rose trying to gain more strength. Unlike Harry, Rose had gotten tired easily and had a hard time holding onto things for long periods of time. Even with Severus and Poppy healing her, the laborious work she was forced to do for years has made her body grow quite tired. Hearing the number of times Rose had been punished for dropping mugs and cups from Harry made Remus worry if it was anything more serious, but luckily after three check-ups, it wasn't.

It wasn't anything strenuous; almost like a baby first building up their muscle, Rose's exercises were morning stretches, going on walks twice a day around the neighborhood, and the occasional having Rose hold an item on their way back home. Of course, the item will get heavier as time goes on. 

Simple yet, it was much too tiring for Rose. She found it weird, she used to be able to do more, but she'd be shaking or in pain the next day. This was much more tolerable- she sounded like an old lady.

Luckily, Rose could hold onto things a lot longer than the previous with each passing day- it was slow, but it was progressing. As for Harry, he was being helped to eat more by Sirius. By their observation and Severus's, they noticed Harry ate much less than Rose. They both didn't eat enough for their age, so Sirius had them eat three times a day without fail, along with snacks in between. Not wanting to disappoint Sirius, they both ate more than they could handle and had gotten sick the following day. Puking out the food, their small stomachs couldn't handle the sudden intake of food, and Sirius had panicked. 

After that day, Sirius had sternly told them that they need only eat as much as they want and not force themselves. It was supposed to be slow progress for them, small habits to build up; it wasn't going to happen overnight. Sirius had said it repeatedly until Remus had pushed him away and asked the twins to repeat what Sirius said. 

So far, living with Sirius and Remus was wonderful. Every day seemed to be better than the next. 

Hearing Remus waking her up with a good morning and a smile, she felt like the happiest girl on earth. It was such a small thing, but to her, it was everything, but... 

She's noticed that Remus was always with her. Whether it'd be saying good morning, helping her with her exercise, to bidding her goodnight. It was always only Remus.

Shaking her head, she erased her doubts. Sirius always smiled at her and hadn't done anything that made Rose cry or fear him. He always asked how she was feeling and if she needed anything throughout the day. He'd make sure she was well-rested and fed practically every hour; it was warming to know someone cared about her well-being, but...

Surely she's only overthinking...

right?

""Morning, pup-!"" Smiling as always, Sirius beamed to see his god-daughter scurrying over to join him and Harry at the dining table.

""Morning, Rose!"" Harry mimicked.

""Morning, Harry. P-Padfoot."" You can practically see the happiness beaming out of Sirius. It took the twins a few days, but they had phased out of their much polite addresses. 

""Did you sleep well?"" Nodding, he helped her up onto her seat. ""Milk or Orange juice?"" 

""Orange juice, please."" 

""How about you, pup?""

""Milk!"" Walking to the kitchen, Sirius grabbed two cups for the twins' drinks while two plates of food were served in front of the twins.

""Thank you, Kreacher.""

""Thank you, Betty."" The two house-elves nodded in acknowledgment before walking away into the kitchen. Harry was quick to dig in while Rose glanced at the two house-elves slowly going about their daily tasks. 

""Oh, Harry, you spilled a little."" Chuckling, Sirius wiped the smear off his cheek.

""Thanks, Padfoot!"" 

House-elves. 

They remember seeing a house-elf in Severus' home, but he never appeared in front of the twins. Severus had something about his house-elf being shy. Although they never saw him, they knew he was kind from the milk and cookies he'd leave them in the morning when they wake up. 

Kreacher and Betty were no different; although Kreacher did scare them at first, he wasn't all that mean as he looked. He may be foul-mouthed, but he had a soft side. During their first night in their new home, they were unable to sleep, so Harry and Rose crept downstairs in the hope of finding Sirius or Remus, but instead, they came to face Kreacher. Frightened by the house-elf, they stood frozen, unsure what to do. 

Kreacher stared at the twins and snarled at them as he walked away into the dark kitchen. 


'R-Rose... d-did we upset him?'



'I-I don't know... h-he's coming back-!!'


""Drink this and go back to bed."" Handing them a cup of warm milk, they stared at the offered drink before taking it. 

""F-For us?""

""Who else do you see around here? Tsk..."" Frowning at the obvious answer to the question, he continued to stare at them with much displeasure on his face. 

'H-harry, I think we should drink this... q-quickly...' Seeing the house elf's face sour, they quickly drank the milk and handed back the mugs. 

""Oh-! My lady and young master, why are you out of bed?"" A second house-elf came running out from the kitchen, looking worriedly at them.

""U-Us?"" Harry asked. 

""Oh-! Kreacher, stop frowning! You'll scare our lady and young master!"" Kreacher ignored the screeching house-elf and walked away. ""I'm very sorry; he's actually a good fellow... sometimes..."" 

""U-Uhm...""

""Oh, I apologize; where are my manners!"" Hitting herself on the head, she smiled at the twins. ""My name is Betty! At your service!"" 

""Hello, Betty... U-Uhm, I'm Harry, and this is my sister, Rose.""

""Oh yes! I've heard a lot about both of you from my master! He and Sir Remus have asked us to prepare for your arrival! 

Master has been very excited about you both coming home!"" Rambling on about how Sirius and Remus were excited about their arrival and getting things ready for them; the twins smiled at Betty. She talked quite a bit, but her rambling made them feel more relaxed.

""O-Oh! Look at me, rambling on like this-!"" Hitting her head, she apologized. 

""P-Please don't hit yourself, Betty.""

""We don't mind your r-rambling."" Smiling at the twins, she saw the time and squeaked. 

""We must get you to bed-! It's already so late!"" Taking the twins to bed, she tucked them both into bed and bid them good night before lighting a single candle and closing their doors. Listening to her descend the stairs, Harry slid off his bed and took a peek outside. Glancing left and right, seeing nobody was around, he quietly closed his door before scurrying into Rose's.

Harry loved his room, but it was much too big and scary to sleep by himself. Luckily, Rose smiled and scooted over to make room for her twin. 

The next morning, the two woke up to a sweet smell. Harry woke up first to see a plate with two sweet cinnamon buns waiting for them at the end of the bed. Thinking it was Betty, they happily ate the offered bun. Betty came into the room saying good morning and two glasses of water in her hand. They thanked Betty for the treat, but she said she wasn't the one to bring them the treat. Confused, they had immediately thought it was Sirius or Remus, but Betty chuckled, saying it would've been Kreacher as the Sirius and Remus had gone out to take care of some business before the sun rose.

Shyly thanking the grouchy house-elf later at breakfast, he muttered to himself and served breakfast. The twins found it hard to believe that Kreacher left them such a sweet treat... 

Thinking it was a one-time thing, they didn't expect any more, but every morning they woke up to find a sweet treat waiting for them at the foot of their bed. Betty was right, Kreacher was nicer than he looked. One morning, Rose woke up earlier than usual and saw Kreacher just leaving her room grumbling- Rose tried not to giggle. 

Waiting till the door closed, Rose let out a small giggle waking Harry. ""Rose...? Is it morning already?""

""No, it's still really early. Sorry."" 

""Mmh... M' sleep more.""

""Okay."" Patting his head, Harry was out like a light. Rose looked over to what Kreacher brought them today, and she smiled. 

Today's treat was chocolate-covered strawberries. 

 

~~

~~

 

""Is it good?"" Sirius asked, smiling at Harry and Rose. 

Harry grinned, nodding as Rose shyly nodded. Remus smiled, seeing the twins eating so well, and continued reading the paper whilst Sirius continued with his coffee and stared at the twins with pure awe. 

""Sirius, you'll scorch a hole through them, don't make them uncomfortable."" Remus warned without looking up.

""It's just my pups are so adorable no matter what they do-!"" 

Remus was sure that Sirius was a complete idiot when it came to Harry and Rose. In a good and bad way.

""Pup, what do you say about practicing on your broom again?"" 

""R-Really?!""

""Of course, you're a natural. I'd bet you'd be a seeker like your dad when you go to Hogwarts.""

""I-I'll do my best-!"" Chuckling, Sirius ruffled Harry's mess of a hair.

""Just have fun, pup. That's all."" Looking up from his paper, Remus raised a brow at Sirius. Hadn't he said the other day that he'd read with Rose? He had said he'd read her his favorite childhood story to her and paint. He had spent most of his time with Harry the past few days. 

""Sirius, I'm sure Harry would want to do something else-""

""N-No, I-I like riding the broom-! Really!"" 

""See?"" 

""But-""

""M-Moony?"" Hearing Rose call him, he stopped mid-sentence and looked over to Rose.

""Yes, love?""

""U-Uhm... c-can I read with you in the sitting room today?""

""... O-Of course, you can. You needn't ask that; I'd be happy to."" Thanking Remus, she took the last bite of her oatmeal and slid off the chair with her empty bowl and cup.

""Done eating, sweetheart?"" Sirius asked. 

""Mmm-hmm."" 

""Why don't you grab the book you wanted Remus to read you?

You can hand that dishes to Betty."" Nodding, she handed it to the waiting house-elf before scurrying off up to her room. 

Folding his paper, Remus stared at Sirius. ""Sirius-""

""P-Padfoot, can Rose come to watch me fly today?""

""Perhaps another time, pup. We wouldn't want another accident, would we?"" Remembering the last time about Harry's collision with Rose, Sirius didn't want Rose to be hurt again.

""O-Oh...""

""Don't worry, pup; you'll get better at landing."" Cheering him up, Harry smiled.

Remus watched the two and took a sip of his coffee. Perhaps, he was overthinking about this; it wasn't like Sirius was completely ignoring or not spending time with Rose.

Well... not as much as he was spending time with Harry...

 

~~

~~

 

It was already the afternoon. Remus and Rose had sat together in the sitting room, reading in silence for about 4 hours. Except for the occasional question, Rose asked about how to read a certain word, or Remus asking if she enjoyed the book. They hadn't done much that would be considered- fun. Even if Rose was a child who liked books, what child honestly likes to sit in silence reading for 4 hours straight?

Remus had asked a few times if there was anything Rose liked to do besides reading, but she couldn't think of anything, or moreover, she was hesitant to tell him. He tried encouraging her to tell him that he'd spend time with her no matter what it was; she immediately refused and smiled, saying she liked sitting next to Remus and reading. He felt like such a failure of a guardian. 

Remus was growing a little tired, rubbing the bridge of his nose and trying to ignore the slight headache that was growing. He's been having a hard time sleeping for the last few days- it seemed like the time has come again. 

Leaning his head against his hand, he glanced down at Rose and sadly smiled. Sirius will take care of them without him for a few days, but he was more worried about how Sirius seemed to spend more time with Harry than Rose. If anything, he was more worried about Rose. Lost in thought, he hadn't realized how tired he was until he closed his eyes. 

""Moony, how do you- oh...."" Looking up to see Remus leaning against his hand and an open book in his lap, he had fallen asleep. Rose marked her page and slipped off the couch. Looking around, she saw a blanket on the couch across from her. Pulling the blanket to Remus, she did her best to cover the sleeping man and took his book, marking it before setting it to the side. 

Gently patting his head, she whispered him good night and scurried away up to her room. 

Putting her book away, she looked around her room. It was really empty... She wasn't sure what to do. She was kind of bored from reading, she didn't have a lot of toys, only the doe that she was gifted, she wasn't allowed to be in the kitchen without Sirius or Remus, nor was she to do any chores. She really had nothing to do...

Hearing laughter outside, she peeked out her window to see Sirius and Harry were playing catch. It looked like fun...

""Miss?""

""Betty."" The house-elf smiled at the girl and held up a plate. 

""I thought you'd like some tea and cookies.""

""O-Oh, thank you."" Putting the plate down, Betty saw Rose was staring down at Harry and Sirius.

""Why not join them?""

Sadly smiling, she shook her head. ""It's okay. I...  I'll just get in the way."" 

""Why do you think that?""

""... Do you need help with anything, Betty?""

""Oh no! Not at all, please leave all the chores to Kreacher and me. You'd only need to eat, sleep and have fun. Per to Master's orders."" 

""...have fun, but I don't think I know how.""

""Why not try something new?""

""Like what?""

""Mmh... how about painting?

Oh-! Hadn't Master say he'd teach you last night? Master loved to paint when he was younger.""

""Painting? What's that?""

""Oh- why don't I bring in a few things that we have? It's quite old, but it's still useable!

Well, I wonder if we still have... Did Master buy them yet? Uhm...

I'll go look for them!"" Disappearing from Rose's sight, she looked back at Harry. 


'Maybe it would've been better if it was only Harry...'


""Ah-! Rose!!"" Harry had seen Rose and began waving as Sirius did the same. Rose ignored the two and looked away, she knew it was rude to do, but she really didn't want to see them smiling at her like that... she didn't like it. 


This feeling... it felt horrible.



'How odd... did she not see us?' 


""Did Rose not see me?"" 

""Perhaps. Why don't we head inside now? I'm sure you're hungry, pup.""

""Yeah!""

 

~~

~~

 

""-and then we played catch!"" 

""Sounds like you had a fun day."" Remus smiled as Harry happily nodded. 

Continuing in detail what he did for the rest of the day with Sirius, the two men smiled, listening to the ecstatic boy. Rose was poking and staring at her food in silence. 

""-ose.""


'.....'


""Rose.""

""H-Huh?"" Looking up, she saw that everyone was staring at her. 

""I-I'm sorry, u-Uhm...""

""Are you alright, pup?"" Sirius asked as he touched her forehead with the back of his hand. She didn't have a fever, but she didn't look that great.

""M'fine... I-I'm sorry, uhm- I'm not that hungry today...""

""Is there something you don't like?"" Remus asked.

""N-No... I-I'm just...

sleepy."" 

""Want me to take you to your room, pup?"" Sirius offered, but Rose refused.

""It's okay... good night."" Smiling at everyone, they all bid her good night, and she walked up to her room. Sirius was curious what was wrong, but hearing she was just tired, he didn't think any more of it. Remus, on the other hand, had a slight idea. 


'....'


Later that evening, Remus knocked on Rose's bedroom door. 

""Love?""

""Moony!"" Putting the book down, she beamed. 

""I brought a new book I think you'll like."" Holding up the book, she smiled, nodding. Chuckling at her excitement, a seat was pulled towards the side of her bed, he noticed the book; Rose put it away to the side. It was a sketchbook. 

""Have you been drawing, love?""

""O-Oh... Uhm... I-I..."" Hesitant, she looked at the door before showing the sketchbook to Remus. ""Betty gave it to me.""

Opening the sketchbook, Remus was quite impressed. For a seven-year-old, they were drawings you'd expect, but it was quite good for a child. With a bit more practice...

""These are very good, sweetheart.""

""R-Really? I-It's not bad?""

""Not at all; you are a natural. Lily used to love to draw as well.

She and Sirius would sketch by the lake sometimes.""

""Padfoot and Mum?""

Thinking back on their relationship, Remus couldn't help but laugh. Lily didn't like James at first nor Sirius- they were both trouble-makers compared to her, someone who followed the rules, and it didn't help that those two made fun of her at first and Severus. 

""Maybe Harry will- Rose? What's the matter?"" Seeing her frown, he grew concerned. Rose hadn't even realized her face had soured. 

""... u-Uhm sorry Moony, can I sleep? I'm tired...""

""Of course, sweetheart. I'll read it to you tomorrow.""

""Okay...""

""Goodnight, Rose."" Pulling the covers to her chin and pressing a small kiss on her forehead, he bid her goodnight. He asked if she wanted the door open, and she nodded. Leaving the door slightly ajar, he left her room. Turning to her side, she stared at her doe. Squeezing its hoof, she felt the horrible feeling rising inside of her. Burying herself further into the covers, she pulled the doe into her arms.


'Harry is better... '


 

~~

~~

 

""Sirius, don't you think that you've been spending more time with Harry than Rose?""

Staring at Remus puzzled, he raised a brow at the sudden statement, ""What do you mean?""

""I mean exactly what I said.""

""Have I? I thought I was spending time with them equally.""

""You can't be serious..."" It was Remus' turn to raise his brow. Had he really thought he was spending time with them equally?

""Yes?""

Sighing, Remus put aside his glass. ""Sirius, it's almost the full moon, and I won't be here to help you for a few days. I'm just worried that you'll make Rose lonelier than she is now. If you keep this up, I'm worried she'll grow to hate you and Harry. I don't think you realize just how much you are hurting her by spending more time with Harry. They are both children; they both need attention, equally.""

""Lonely? But she has us-""

""Sirius, will you listen and think before opening your mouth for once!""

Holding out his hands in defense, Sirius kept his mouth shut and nodded. Remus headaches were beginning to grow more irritating as each night passed, growing closer to the full moon. Taking in a deep breath, he rubbed the bridge of his nose. 

""I don't think you notice just how much you seem to favour Harry over Rose. So starting from tomorrow, I want you to spend time with Rose while I spend time with Harry.""

""I honestly don't think I favour him over her, but alright."" 

Honestly, Remus worried too much. It wasn't as if he spent most of his time with Harry. He loved them both very much, as if they were his own, how could he dare-

Oh, by Merline's beard, Remus was right. 

The next day at breakfast, Sirius had asked Rose what she'd like to do today, and she stared at him with confusion. Asking if there were anything she'd like to do today with Sirius, she responded, 

""Sir can play with Harry. I'm going to read in my room."" If anyone else were in the dining room, they would've thought a dementor had come by. 

""Love, why don't you play a game with Sirius today?"" Remus asked, trying to get Rose to be open to the idea. 

""Rose, let's play together with Pa'foot!"" Harry happily exclaimed, but Rose shook her head. 

""M' okay... I'm full. May I be excused?"" 

""H-Huh? O-Oh, sure pup."" Sliding off her chair, she ran over to Remus and pulled on his sleeve. Leaning down, she gave him a small peck on the cheek and ran off to her room. Remus smiled at the shy affection whilst Sirius stared at Rose disappearing upstairs. 

Sirius tried to appeal to Rose the rest of the morning, but it turned out more difficult than he realized. First, he took the book that Remus had read halfway and her favourite sweet- Pumpkin Pastie. Knocking on her door and holding out the book, saying he'll read her the rest of the story, she shook her head, saying that Remus needed to finish reading it for her. Sirius offered that he'd like to read to her and held out the treat he brought for them to have as he said he had brought her favourite. He didn't expect to see her looking so upset. 

""That's not my favourite...""

""Sorry?""

""That's Harry's favourite."" 

""O-Oh, was it? S-Sorry p-""

Grabbing her book, she ran out the door, ""Also... you were reading that book to Harry yesterday."" Running downstairs, Sirius looked down to see Rose was right. 

""...damn it.""

Point one for Rose. 

Sirius wasn't about to give up; he had to show Rose he cared for her too, just as much as he did for Harry. After the failure of attempt 1, he tried his next one- flying lessons!

Sirius had seen Rose glance over at Harry when he was flying on his broom many times. She always stared at the broom with much fascination and seemed to want to learn herself but never asked, only stared. Seeing as he's never taught her, nor did Remus, he had bought a broom for Rose. Taking it to Rose and saying he'll teach her, she refused. 

""Harry likes to fly; I don't."" 

It's fine... it's just going to be harder than it looked...

Games, sweets, and toys, everything Rose refused because it was all Harry's favourite. Sirius felt like he deserved to go back to Azkaban; how could he only know so much about his god-son and not his god-daughter. 

Sirius was out of ideas; he was slumped against the couch in defeat and thinking over the many ways he deserves death- his god-daughter hated him now. 

""Where is a dementor when you need one..."" 

""What are you doing on the couch?"" Remus asked. 

""Oh, nothing. Only thinking about my deserved death."" Slamming the bottle onto the table, Sirius flinched and looked up; Remus had a dark expression.

""Don't even joke about that."" Practically jumping out of the couch, he took the bottle away from Remus and apologized. 

""I'm sorry, Remus. I honestly didn't mean it like that-"" Taking a deep breath, he recomposed himself. 

""I know..."" 

""I just... it's..."" With an irritated sigh, he grabbed the nearby glasses, ""- you were right. And because of me, Rose is growing very distant."" 

""You only need to spend time with her, Sirius.""

""I did, I tried, but... everything I tried to do with her... it all goes back to Harry...""

""Sirius, did you maybe think about what Rose would want to do?""

""Of course I did. I've tried with books and...

books....""

""Wow... I can see you two are bonding very well."" Glaring at Remus for the snarky remark, Sirius sighed. 

""I don't know what to do.""

""Talk to her. Sirius. Talking, you're good at that.""

""It seems I'm not good at anything when it comes to my precious god-daughter."" Patting his shoulder, he handed him a glass and smiled. 

""Don't worry; you'll be fine. Just talk to her.

Listen and talk to her like you do with Harry.""

 

~~

~~

 

""Rose, pup?"" 

""Hello, sir."" Sirius wished a dragon could swallow him at this point... his pup was back to calling him, sir-! He was ready to be on the verge of tears. 


'Oh... Mother Magic, have mercy on me...'


""U-Uhm, sweetheart... why don't you and I do something today? Together? It can be anything.""

""... Why not with Harry?"" Flicking the corner of the book page, she didn't look up at Sirius. 

""Rose? Pup? Would you look at me, please?"" 

""..."" Kneeling in front of Rose, he held Rose's hand and sadly smiled. 

""I'm sorry, pup. I didn't mean to leave you out; I hadn't even realized I made you feel so left out.""

""...S'okay.""

""No, no, it's not, sweetheart. 

I promised to take care of you both and love you both equally. I may not be the best person, but I really- truly do love you just as much as I love Harry. You are both my pups.""

""... really?""

""Yes.""

""But... n-no nothing.""

""Tell me, pup. What is it?"" 

""...I thought maybe...""

""Go ahead, sweetheart. Tell me.""

""... if only Harry was here, it'd be better...""

""Oh. Pup. No, no, no. 

That's not true, I'm the one who made- 

Rose Lily Potter. You are just as important as the next person. You are loved, deserving, and just so adorable-!"" Tickling her stomach, Rose giggled making Sirius smile. 

""Pup, the next time you are mad or feel upset, I want you to tell one of us. No, actually,

-throw a tantrum, yell, scream, anything.""

""N-No, that's bad-!!"" Mortified by the suggestion, Sirius chuckled. 


'I would've actually preferred if you threw a tantrum...' 


""I'm really sorry, pup. Forgive me?""

""...Okay, but-""

""Yes?""

""Teach me to paint? Moony and Betty said you were very good."" 

""I'd love to, my spring bud."" Poking her stomach again, she giggled as he bumped his forehead against hers. ""I love you both very much, Rose."" Shyly smiling back, she kissed his cheek. ""We love you too, Padfoot."" 

""I have the cutest god-children in the world-!!"" Scooping Rose into his arms, he nuzzled his beard against her cheek making her laugh out loud. Her laughter echoed throughout the house. Remus was in Harry's room and heard Rose's laughter, Harry heard Rose and smiled. 

""I've never heard Rose laugh before.""

""...never?"" Harry sadly smiled.

""No... she was always sad, but I'm happy Rose is happy now."" 

""You'll be happy, Harry. You and Rose.""

""He he, I know, Moony."" Hugging Remus's leg, he ruffled the boy's head until he caught a whiff of outside. Looking out the window, he saw the skies were gray, as it was most days but it seemed to grow darker. 


 'Seems like it'll rain tonight...' 


It's beginning to rain tonight & the electricity in the house goes out.Thunder begins rolling through and the twins panic remembering their days back at their relatives...

It's time for cuddles!!

(A/N): Apologies for the short chap- I have slight writer's block.

Oh! I got to go to the Harry Potter NYC store-!! Somehow I managed to get in on the third day- Omg, it was magical, beautiful & just- amazing. So glad I got to go in! The queue was insane! Got there around 9 am but couldn't go in until around 4 pm. I'm just glad I got to go in.Yes, I realize I could've gone on a later date, but come on...Although the online queue was long, it was really well-organized despite all the people, the staff was so nice and just overall- I'd go back again. :DLet's be real, of course, I'm going back.I am poor now, but don't regret it


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

It began raining. 

Remus was right on the mark; as soon as he smelled the air, rain began hitting the windows as the wind slowly began picking up. Shutting the windows, he noticed the time and saw it was almost time for supper. Asking Harry what he'd want for supper, Harry said anything was fine. But, unfortunately, he was much too compliant. Calling for Kreacher, the house-elf appeared with a less than enthusiastic smile- but what did he expect from Kreacher. Asking Kreacher to add a few new things to tonight's supper, Kreacher groaned and listened to Remus's requests. Harry stared outside at the window worriedly.


'... I hope no thunders come.'


""Harry?""

""Y-Yes?!"" Startled, he squeaked out, making Remus chuckle.

""What made you so lost in thought?"" Patting the top of his head, Harry shook his head and smiled. 

""N-Nothing, I'm just excited about supper!"" 

""Are you hungry?""

""A little.""

""Why don't we have a small snack, nothing too heavy, since supper isn't until at 7. We still have at least two hours until then.""

""Can I eat with Rose?""

""Of course, shall we invite Rose and Sirius for a snack?"" Nodding enthusiastically, he ran out of his room with Remus telling him to be careful. Leaving Harry's room, Remus heard a small rumble. 


'Seems like we'll be having a thunderstorm tonight.'


 

~~

~~

 

Supper was fantastic as always. There was more food than the twins can eat and had only ever dreamt about. Taking the last bite of their dinner, Harry was stuffed; he couldn't have another bite. Patting his small stomach in satisfaction, Sirius chuckled. It wasn't every day he's seen Harry eat so much, and in satisfaction, it was relief his appetite was slowly building up. 

Rose let out a sigh of content as she swallowed her last bite. Tonight's supper seemed to be better than last night, but it was always good. Then, smiling at her own satisfaction, she looked at Harry and chuckled. 

""Harry."" Pointing to the corner of her lip, he touched the opposite side of his lip. 

""Here?"" Shaking her head, she pointed again, but he missed. Then, giggling, she grabbed the napkin and wiped the sauce off Harry's face.

""Sauce."" 

""Oh-! Thank you!"" A small thud made the twins turn around. Sirius was looking away with his fist on the table whilst Remus chuckled. What was wrong with Sirius? He was shaking... did they do something wr- 

Turning back to the twins, his mouth twitched, making the twins confused. Then, tilting their head at the same time, Sirius leaned against his chair and muttered something. Was Sirius ill?

""Pa'foot, are you okay?"" Harry asked worriedly.

""Are you sick?? U-Uhm Betty-!"" Calling for the house-elf, Remus chuckled and calmed the twins down. Saying Sirius was just an idiot, Sirius glared at Remus unamused. 

After supper, they had all had a scoop of a trifle- Harry and Rose enjoying it most, Sirius suggested they all play a game before heading to sleep. Looking for the game boards, Sirius wasn't sure what would be the best game to play, so Remus suggested Jenga. 

""Jenga? That's not a good idea."" Sirius shook his head.

""Why not? It's simple and fun.""

""Perhaps if we were in our 70s, sure."" 

""You are only saying that because you never win."" 

""Are you challenging me?"" 

""Seems like we'll be the only ones having fun; come on, Harry. Rose."" Guiding them to the sitting room, Sirius smirked. He wasn't one to run away from a challenge, especially if Remus mocked him so. 

""You're on."" 

After 5 rounds, it was decided that Sirius was terrible at Jenga. However, even with Harry and Rose's hands shaking non-stop from nervousness, they were able to keep the tower of blocks balanced till the end. 

""You really are still terrible at this game."" Remus chuckled. 

""I give up. You all win; I raise my flag."" Holding out his wand, a white flag appeared, waving his defeat. Rolling out his eyes, Remus said Sirius was a drama queen as always before seeing the time. 

""Why don't you both go wash up now? It's time for bed."" Nodding, they took the fallen blocks and put them into the container. Sirius was so happy to see them being so responsible. 

""Can Moony read to me again?"" Rose asked.

""Of course, love.""

""Can Harry listen too?""

""Of course, if he wants."" 

""I do!""

""Alright, I'll see you both upstairs."" Rushing upstairs, they can hear their voices echoing about Harry wanting to sleep in Rose's room tonight. 

 

~~

""-There was a table et out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head-""

""Remus."" Stopping mid-way, Remus looked to see the twins had fallen asleep. Smiling, he marked the page as the book was flown back to its rightful place on the shelf. Sirius blew out the candles and pulled the covers up to their chins whilst Remus drew the curtains shut around their bed. Leaving their room quietly, the two men decided to have a drink or two before turning in for the night without realizing how close the storm was brewing. 

The twins were at peace until they heard a deep rumble outside, waking them up. Harry was the first to wake up at the sound, wondering what the noise was; he looked around confused until the sharp thunder clapped. Rose jolted awake as she latched onto Harry in instinct, shaking. 

Harry held Rose's hand and shook in fear. Hearing the thunder always scared them- there always was a thunderstorm when Vernon and Petunia wanted to inflict pain on them. They were even once thrown outside in the backyard during a thunderstorm making their fear grow. 

""I'm scared..."" Rose whimpered as the thunder began to rumble louder than the next. The wind was growing stronger as the rain began to pour harder. 

""W-we'll be f-"" Harry wasn't able to even comfort Rose, hearing the thunder and the branches outside slamming against the window. 

It was too much. Everything was too loud, dark, and the room seemed to be growing scarier the longer they stayed in it. 


'We're right next door; come to us if you need anything.'


Sirius' words the first day popped into Harry's mind. He had forgotten; they didn't need to be so scared. They had Sirius and Remus, but... would they allow them to stay in his room? Worried about being a nuisance, Harry wasn't sure, but hearing the thunderclap louder than before helped make up his mind. 


'R-Rose, let's go to Pa'foot.'



'B-But... c-can we?'



'W-we can ask to stay for a little bit...'



'o...okay.'


Creeping out of Rose's room, they held each other's hand and stared at the dark hallway. All the candles had been blown out, and they couldn't really see anything unless the thunder outside illuminated through the windows for few seconds, but that made it all the scarier. 

Building up what little courage they had, they forced themselves to walk through the scary hallway. Waddling through, Rose couldn't handle it when the thunder struck down, the loudest of them all. She dropped to the floor and held her hands over her head whilst Harry froze in place. 

""I-I can't Harry... I-I can't anymore..."" Trembling as her tears threatened to spill, Harry shakily looked up and saw they were almost to Sirius's room. They were so close-

""R-Rose- w-we're almost-""

""Harry? Rose?"" Harry was quick to turn around. It was Sirius and Remus; they had both been downstairs. 

""S-Sirius...""

""What's wrong-"" Interrupted by the thunder, Harry ran to Remus and gripped onto his leg, shaking. 

""Were you both frightened by the thunder?"" Remus asked gently as he placed a hand on Harry's back. 

""W-We're s-sorry..."" 

""No, don't be, Harry. It's alright to be afraid-"" Rose practically shrieked as the thunder continued to clap multiple times. Sirius was quick to wrap his arms around the trembling child and whisper words of comfort.

""It's alright, pup. I'm here.

There's nothing to be afraid of."" Uncurling from herself, she latched onto Sirius and wept into his chest. Patting her back and praising her for being so brave made her cry even harder. 

""You must've been very scared."" Remus pulled Harry into his arms as the boy continued to tremble from the thunder. Gripping onto Remus's jumper, Remus smiled and did the same as Sirius praising him for being such a brave boy. Feeling his shoulder being soaked, Remus smiled and stroked Harry's head. 

""It's alright now.""

The storm wasn't leaving anytime soon tonight.

~~

~~

 

Settling into Sirius's room, Remus had the curtains drawn, and the hearth lit while Sirius gently set the twins in the center of his bed. Smiling and saying words of comfort seemed to ease their fear, but every time they heard the thunder, it made them revert to a shaking mess. Taking out his wand, he held it up to the ceiling, and a large silk-like curtain appeared and wrapped itself around the bed. Like Rose's bed curtains, they couldn't see anything out of it except for the slight glow from the fire. 

It was still too dark, and the twins can still hear the storm outside, it was too much, but their worries were put to ease as few lights softly illuminated around them. It reminded them of fireflies. Remus had joined them and muttered a silencing charm around the hovering fabric. 

The storm was gone. They couldn't hear outside anymore; it was quiet. 

Remus could see the fear practically melt out of their body as the twins relaxed against the covers. 

""Nothing to be afraid of; it's just us."" Stroking their heads and wiping away the stray tears, they let out a few little sniffles and nodded. 

""S-sorry...""

""Harry, there's no need for you to apologize."" Remus held out a tissue to Harry's nose.

Blowing into the offered tissue, he sniffled and looked at Remus worriedly, ""... can we stay here? For a little bit?"" 

Throwing away the tissues, Remus stared at Harry, baffled at his words, and sadly smiled. Leaning against the headboard, he held out his arms, asking Harry to come over. Taking a seat in his lap, Remus wrapped his arms around him. 

""We'll stay with you all night if you want. You needn't force yourself; you are both safe."" 

""It must've been very frightening. You were very brave, pups."" Sirius smiled at Rose as he wiped away the stray tears. 

""S-Siri... i-I was..."" Unable to control her sniffles and stutters, Sirius pulled her into his arms and stroked her hair. ""It's alright now. You are safe now."" 

Burying her face into his chest, he stroked her back to ease her nervousness. Rose was so embarrassed; she had cried so much in front of Sirius and Remus. She was supposed to be the helpful one, but she had made Harry more scared because of her. Why did she have to be like this?


'Rose, it's okay.'



'I-I'm sorry...'



'Don't be. I don't like the thunder either, remember?'



'B-But... I...'


Wiggling out of Remus's arms, Harry crawled over to Sirius and patted Rose's head. Peeking out from Sirius's chest, Harry smiled at Rose. ""At least we're not alone.""

Holding hands, the twins let out a few more tears before the weariness came through. Finally, haven cried themselves to sleep; Remus gently pulled the covers but saw Sirius had fallen asleep with his arm draped over the twins. Quietly chuckling to himself, he laid behind Harry and got comfortable before pulling the covers.

""Goodnight.""

            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

""Harry-! You can't hog the ball!"" 

""You'll have to catch me!""

""That's not fair! Harry~!!!"" 

Grinning ear to ear, Harry made his way down the stairs as Rose followed, trying to catch her mischievous twin. At the bottom of the stairs, Rose had to stop to catch her breath as Harry giggled, retreating to the sitting room.

""Harry~!!"" 

Running around the couch a few times, Rose was exhausted. Leaning against the couch, Harry worriedly stared at Rose. 

""S-sorry Rose, are you ok-""

""I gotcha-!!"" Jumping over the couch, Harry was quick to dodge her grasp and ran into the kitchen. Frustrated, she ran after him but stopped in her track and snuck to the opposite entrance. 

""Watch where you are running, Harry. Wouldn't want you to get hurt."" Remus said, smiling as he continued to read through the Daily Prophet. 

""I'll be careful, Moony-!""

Confident he got away from Rose, Harry turned around but saw she wasn't following him. Calling out her name, he was met with silence. Worried she had gotten hurt again, he walked back into the sitting room but saw nobody was there. Not noticing the person behind him, he was tackled to the ground. 

""Gotcha-!"" 

Giggles filled the kitchen as the twin laid on the ground laughing at their own silliness. Remus glanced at the giggling twins and was happy to see them acting their age; they were finally settling in and comfortable with them. After that night with the thunder, Harry and Rose had been more open towards Sirius and Remus. Little things like asking for help, telling them that they had gotten hurt, or asking to play games with them. Remus had seen how happy Sirius was about the twins, especially his relationship with Rose- to think she had a bit of a prankster spirit like Harry.

It was entertaining to see Sirius happily accept a drink the twins made for him but only be solidified by gelatin. He had thought he had gone mad as he shook the cup a few times, confused as to why the drink wasn't spilling. Sirius had punished them with tickles making them laugh so hard that tears spilt. 

The past few days truly have been bliss. 

""Moony?"" Tugging on his pants, he smiled down at the curious twins. 

""What's the matter?"" Hearing their tone, they were curious about something. 

""Can we see Draco again?"" Rose asked. 

""Oh. That's right; it's been almost a month, hasn't it?"" Remembering they had met on their birthday, it was obvious they'd miss their first friend. 

""Is it okay if we see him?"" Harry wasn't sure if it was allowed. 

""Of course, but we need first to ask; Draco can have other plans. It'd be rude of us to just suddenly show up without an invitation or asking ahead of time.

I'll ask Sirius if he can ask Narcissa, alright?"" Nodding, the twins thanked Remus before running off to play. Rose stopped mid-way and ran back to Remus. He smiled and leaned down without being asked as she kissed his cheek, and he kissed her forehead. It had become an adorable habit between the two, and Sirius was quite jealous when he saw them. Rose giggled when Sirius pouted and asked why he was not loved making Rose kiss his cheek. Sirius had peppered the girl's face with small kisses, making her laugh at Sirius' silliness. 

Running off to join her twin, Remus pondered how he should ask Sirius about the twins' desire to meet with Draco. The last time he suggested they should invite the Malfoys for dinner, Sirius had scowled at the mere suggestion and talked non-stop about how much of a prick Lucius is and Narcissa planning on stealing the twins for herself. Remus had smacked the back of his head at his childishness over the matter. 

Sighing, he folded back the paper and walked to find his drama queen of a friend without realizing an owl flying through the kitchen window with a letter. 

""Oh. Thank you."" Betty caught the letter and handed a small snack to the owl. Accepting the snack, he ate it gratefully before flying off. 

 

 


 To: Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Harry James Potter & Rose Lily Potter


 



 




 From: Narcissa Malfoy  


 


 *Sirius, dear. Please read this before you toss it with an eye roll.  


 

 

~~

~~

 

""Sirius-"" Walking into the study, Sirius had several documents floating around him. 

""One moment, Remus. I need to finish reading these documents."" It was always a sight to see Sirius so serious, the irony. He was always a troublemaker, but when needed be, he was responsible. Perhaps there was one thing to thank his horrible pureblood parents; manners, etiquette, and responsibilities- even if he did tend to ignore them more than he should. 

""It's about Harry and Rose."" The papers floated down to the table in a neat pile as Sirius looked up. 

""They alright?""

""They're just fine. Rather I'm here on their behalf."" 

""Oh pray do tell, what could it be for Remus Lupin to be their representative."" Chuckling, Remus smiled. 

""They want to see Draco.""

""Remus...."" Groaning, it was Remus's turn to chuckle. 

""You aren't going to deprive them of seeing their first friend, will you?"" Sighing, he mumbled something about not wanting to see snobby Lucius. 

""Must you be so dramatic?""

""Are you telling me that you don't remember what he was like at Hogwarts?""

""Yes, I clearly remember, but that's just how he is. What can we do about it?""

""Just looking at him reminds me of how much of a pain he was during Hogwarts..."" 

""Master?"" Betty peeked into the study, hesitant to enter. 

""Betty, what's the matter?""

""I have a letter for Master.""

""You can just leave with the others-""

""It's also for Sir Remus, young master, and the young lady.""

""All of us?"" Scurrying over to Sirius, she handed him the letter and vanished, saying she had chores to finish. 

Reading who the sender was, Sirius groaned. ""It's as if she was listening to our conversation.""Handing the letter to Remus, he saw the note below and chuckled. Reading the letter, he smiled. 

""We've been invited over for lunch. Rose and Harry will be delighted.""

""Oh, I can't wait."" 

""Don't be so dramatic.""

 

~~

~~

 

""Mother!""

""Draco, no running through the dining room."" Warning her son, Draco slowed down his speed and smiled. 

""I'm sorry, mother.""

""It's quite alright, dear. Now, what is making you run to me in such a hurry?""

""Did you invite Potters?""

""Of course, I did. And Draco, it is rude to say Potters,' they do have names, dear.""

""Harry and Rose.""

""Very good.""

""Mother?""

""Yes, dear?""

""...Do you think they'll be okay meeting with my friends?""

""I don't see why not; the more people they'll meet will be good for them.""

""I do hope so...""

""Also, Draco, what you heard about their past, do not tell anyone else. Understand?""

""But why? My friends wouldn't-""

""I know, dear, but it is not for you to tell. 

Harry and Rose may not be comfortable telling others, and it hasn't been that long, so just be careful, alright?""

""Yes, mother."" 

""Now then, I have a few more invitations to send out. 

Why don't you find your father? I believe he is in the library."" Running off to find his father, Narcissa held out the remaining invitations to the owl waiting in front of her. Taking the offered invitations, she spread her wings and flew off as another owl came flying in and dropping a letter in front of her. 

Opening the letter, she smiled. Sirius had sent back his reply- more like a note- in such nice stationary, she almost believed it was Remus who wrote back to her rather than Sirius. Well, at least he sent back a somewhat of a reply. 

""It'll be quite a party tomorrow.""

 


 We'll come. 



 But don't think about stealing my pups!! 


 

~~

~~

 

 

""Moony! Moony! What's that bird?!"" 

""It's beautiful."" 

Stretching out his hand, Harry pointed to the white bird along the top of the neatly trimmed hedges; Remus chuckled at the twins' curiosity. ""That is a white peacock; well, Lucius had said it was an 'albino peacock'.""

""Surprised that bird hasn't bitten off Lucius' mouth yet."" 

""I'm quite sure that bird wouldn't dare hurt its owner.""

""Maybe I can convince it.""

""Stop it."" Sirius shrugged it off hearing Remus' warning and grinned.

""Come on; it'd be fun.""

""Oh, by Merlin's beard, we're going to be banned here because of you."" Remus already felt a migraine coming as Sirius chuckled.

""Does that bird live here?"" Rose asked.

""That's right, love. It's Lucius's pet.""

""Pet? That big bird?"" Harry was in awe of the majestic bird staring back at them. As if it could see the twin's amazement over itself, the peacock unfurled its feather, showing off the unique feathers. The twin's eyes were practically sparkling.

""Can it be like any more of its owner?"" Sirius was sure the peacock was acting proud at the fact the twins were so amazed at itself. 

""I thought I heard voices."" 

Glancing over, Remus greeted their host. ""They were fascinated by your pet.""

""Ah, I see. Well, don't have them get too close; she isn't very friendly to most.

She even snapped her beak at me once, and Draco isn't fond of her after she did the same to him. 

Lucius was barely able to tame her.""

""Really~"" Smiling at the fact Lucius can't handle his own pet gave Sirius great joy.

""Must you be so petty?"" Remus rolled his eyes as Sirius shrugged.

""I take what I can.""

""Come along; everyone is already here. Let me introduce you to everyone whilst Draco takes the twins."" 

Narcissa guided her guests to the front entrance. As the doors opened, the twins were in awe once more, seeing the size of the manor. They knew Sirius was wealthy, but Draco's family seemed to be on another level. Left and right, they were just as amazed, but Rose had spoken out loud without realizing it. 

""Isn't it lonely?"" 

""What do you mean, dear?"" 

""A-Ah, I-I'm sorry...""

""Oh, don't worry, Rose, I'm not mad. I'm just curious by what you mean.""

""U-Uhm... this big house... just the three of you seems kinda lonely...""

""Oh... I've never thought of it that way before."" 

""I'm sorry... ""

""Don't be, dear."" Smiling at Rose, Narcissa offered her hand to the child. ""Thank you for worrying for us."" Such a sweetheart.

""Here we are.""

""If it isn't Sirius Black-! Here in the flesh, my, my.

You are looking better than I had thought."" 

""Pleased to see you as well."" Sirius sarcastically replied as the woman smirked.

""Still the same, aren't you?""

""It's a pity I can't say the same about you, Amaryllis."" 

""And here I thought you were a gentleman, insulting me in front of your little ones. Tsk, tsk."" The woman put down her glass and leaned down towards the staring twins. Smiling, she said hello as the twins replied timidly. 

""Aren't you just adorable?"" Smiling at Rose, she timidly nodded, unsure how to react. Chuckling at her shyness, she felt an arm wrap around her waist. ""I do hope you and my Pansy get along. I'm sure she'll be thrilled to have another girl in the group.""

""Dear, do and try not to scare them."" The man behind her said, chuckling.

""As if I'd do such a thing to these two precious things, Percival."" 

""I'll have to agree with Percival, dear. You have a reputation for scaring children. Take my Blaise, for example. The first time we met, he began to cry."" Rose glanced behind Amaryllis to see a beautiful dark-skinned woman sitting at the table with a glass of wine in her hand. Rose wasn't sure if she's ever seen anyone so beautiful.

Locking eyes with Rose, the woman smiled at Rose and gave her a wink. Rose shyly giggled at the woman's silliness. 

""I do think we should let them see the other children before you bore them with your side conversations."" Another woman had said as she pointed to the Draco waiting at the stairway, pretending to look around elsewhere.

Narcissa chuckled and nodded. ""Indeed, Mrs Nott is right. Shall we let them go join the others whilst we converse amongst ourselves?""

""We'll be here if you need anything, alright? Have fun."" Remus smiled as he gave them a small nudge. Harry was the first to practically run to the awaiting Draco at the bottom of the stairway. 

""What if they don't like me...?"" Rose asked. 

""You have my permission to smack my son if he is rude to such a lovely flower as you."" 

""As mine."" 

""You can just give them all a good smack if they are mean towards you."" Amaryllis encouraged Rose as the adults all agreed, nodding.

""B-But hitting is bad..."" Sirius smiled and stroked the top of Roses' head. 

""Don't worry, pup; you just be yourself. I'm sure they'll like you as Draco did. 

And if you are having too hard of a time, you can come back to Remus and me, alright pup?""

""...o-okay.""

""That's my brave pup. Off you go now."" Kissing Sirius' cheek in thanks, she did the same to Remus and scurried off to Harry and Draco waiting for her. 

""How sweet~"" Amaryllis smiled as Sirius ignored her and looked at Narcissa.

""I had thought you said it'd be a small gathering."" 

""Yes."" Narcissa smiled. 

""You must have a different definition of the word 'small'."" 

""Well, you know as they say- 

the more, the merrier.""

""I hardly think that applies to this."" 

 

~~

~~

 

""I'm so glad you guys were able to come!"" Draco grinned, seeing the twins again as he led them upstairs.

""Thank you for the i-invite."" Rose thanked as Harry nodded, making Draco happier.

""Of course!

I can't wait for you to meet my friends!""

""Friends?""

""I've known them all my whole life, don't worry, they're all nice."" 

""I can't wait to meet them."" Harry was excited to meet these new kids, whilst Rose was a little unsure. Unlike Harry, Rose wasn't sure of what to say or act. She always felt like the odd one out, even if Harry tells her that she isn't odd. 

Arriving at one of the rooms, Draco opened the large doors, and the twins were met with many eyes staring at them. It was a little unsettling, but they were immediately welcomed, melting away their tension. Looking at the group, Rose noticed a girl in the far back staring at Rose. Was she the girl the lady downstairs had hoped Rose would be good friends with? 

Draco introduced the twins to his friends, and they all smiled, welcoming the two. Going around, they introduced themselves. 

Vincent Crabb, Gregory Goyle, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and Pansy Parkinson.

""It's nice to meet the famous Potters.""

""It's nice to meet you."" Shaking hands with Harry, Blaise lifted Rose's hand to his lips to press a light kiss on top. 

""What are you such a gentleman for?"" Pansy was annoyed to see Blaise acting so chivalrous.

""I was only saying hello."" Rolling his eyes, the other boys snickered. 

""She's only jealous cuz you never did such a thing to her."" Vincent chuckled as Pansy glared at the boys.

""Am not. I just find it odd that you're so gentle to a girl.""

""When was I not?"" Scoffing, Pansy pointed to herself, making the boys roar with laughter again. Grumbling about boys being immature, Draco chuckled. 

""Your one of us, Pansy. Blaise will probably act like that around Rose later on."" Walking up to Rose, she grabbed her arm and pulled Rose to her side. 

""I'm going to play with Rose! You boys can play together for all I care!"" 

Pulling Rose to the next adjoining room, the boys chuckled at Pansy's outburst. ""No need to be such a drama queen."" 

""You think she can be any more excited?"" Blaise chuckled. 

""Oh, so it wasn't just me who noticed?"" 

""Guess she's tired of us, boys."" Theodore laughed.

""Uhm... is Rose going to be okay...?"" Harry asked worriedly.

""Don't worry, Pansy might act like that, but she's actually pretty happy to see Rose."" Draco explained, making Harry relieved. 

""How about we play exploding snap!""

""Exploding snap?""

""We'll teach you.""

""Pansy-""

""You weren't thinking of playing without us, were you?""

""You left the room!""

""Come on, stop yelling at each other and take a seat."" Gathering around in a circle, Blaise began drawing cards whilst Harry and Rose was told the rules. 

 

~~

~~

 

It hadn't even been an hour, and everyone can hear the children's voices growing louder and echoing through the halls with each passing minute. It was wonderful to hear the children all getting along. Narcissa glanced at Sirius and Remus to see them smiling to themselves as they drank their tea until the last guests arrived. 

""I apologize for being late."" 

""Oh, Merlin's beard, the bat and stallion have arrived."" Sirius groaned.

""I had thought it smelled like a mutt. It seems like you even brought company."" Sneering at the two Gryffindors, Sirius's eye twitched. 

""Severus. I almost believed you'd never arrive, and Darling, why are you so late?"" Narcissa asked as Severus took a seat across from Remus. 

""I had a few things to pick up."" Lucius explained as Narcissa sighed in defeat. 

""Well, at least, you are here. 

""I should've arrived later..."" Ignoring the glare from Sirius, Remus jabbed Sirius' side. 

""Quit it."" 

""Are you two still bickering like an old married couple?"" 

""Lilith, must you put me on the same level as that mutt? And I do have standards"" Unamused by Zabini's sarcasm; she held back from bursting out into laughter. 

""Oh come now, Severus~. 

Do relax a little. You always were so tense."" Rolling his eyes, she smiled as the others chuckled at Zabini's teasing. 

""You'd be lucky to have me. I'm a catch."" Sirius rolled his eyes as Sirius scoffed.

""Can your pride grow any bigger?"" 

""Looks who's talking.""

""Some things never change, do they?"" Amaryllis chuckled whilst the man beside her drank his tea, uninterested.

""Oh come now, Parrish, we know you're a man of few words, but it's been a while since we've all met like this."" Nudging the man to say a word, he ignored Amaryllis making Narcissa chuckle.

""Amaryllis, you know he won't say anything unless necessary. He finds talking too exhausting."" Parrish nodded.

""I still find it hard to believe we've known each other all these years, and yet he refuses to talk to us! Us, Narcissa!!"" 

""Now, now, love."" Percival tried to calm his wife as she pouted at the silent man. Flashing her a small smile, Amaryllis felt her eyes twitch in annoyance. 

""Parrish-!"" 

""Parrish, darling, do stop teasing Amaryllis."" Tutting at her husband, he only smiled back and took another sip of his tea.

""Do forgive him, Amaryllis; you know how he is."" 

""Oh Ravenna, you are a dear. How did someone as lovely as you get married to someone like this silent brute?"" Pointing to the man, he opened his mouth, making Amaryllis shocked. 

""Because I said yes."" 

""BY LADY MAGIC. HE SPEAKS!"" Frowning at Amaryllis, everyone chuckled.

""Do you think Gregory will be like his father?"" Lilith asked.

""It's suffocating enough with this one. We don't need another silent Goyle."" 

""Oh goodness, I hadn't noticed the time."" Without realizing how much time had passed by, Narcissa heard the children coming downstairs. It seems they couldn't wait any longer. Scurrying over to their parents, Narcissa rang her bell, indicating the house-elves it was finally time for lunch. Taking their seats, they watched their lunch be served.

Glancing over at Rose, Pansy grinned and called for Rose. Catching her attention, Pansy beamed, ""Rose, how old are you?""

""O-Oh Uhm, I'm seven. Harry and I are the same age.""

""We're all the same age! What's your favourite colour?"" 

""U-Uhm... I-I don't know, green?""

""Me too! Oh-! What about-"" 

""Pansy, stop that. You are overwhelming the poor thing."" Sheepishly apologizing, Rose shook her head as Amaryllis apologized for her daughter's behaviour.

""I'm sorry, sweetling, Pansy has never had a female friend before. I think she's a little too excited."" 

""I-I have other girl... friends."" Pansy mumbled, embarrassed.

""You do not. You only hang out with us."" Theodore teased. 

""Theodore, do not be rude."" 

""He was only teasing, Cellica."" Amaryllis chuckled, trying to ease Mrs Nott's worries. 

""Has Pansy been nice to you? I know she can be-""

""Mother!!"" The adults all laughed as Amaryllis sighed, distraught Pansy was a little too aggressive to Rose.

Shaking her head, Rose spoke. ""N-No, Mrs Parkinson, P-Pansy is really nice to me..."" 

""Oh."" Looking at Pansy to see her holding her head high- I told you so- Amaryllis chuckled. ""How wonderful for you, Pansy. Try not and scare her away.""

""M-Mother-!!"" 

""You needn't be so formal with me, sweetling; you can just call me Amaryllis."" Rose was quick to refuse; it was hard enough to get used to calling Sirius and Remus by their nicknames. 

""Don't force her so much, dear. Give it a little time."" Percival chuckled. 

""How about Aunt Amy? I know my name can be difficult for children."" 

""Then I'd love it if you can call me Uncle Percy."" 

""Stop it, you two."" Sirius warned. 

""Come now; we're all family, aren't we?"" Amaryllis smiled.

""Family, my ars-"" Remus was quick to jab Sirius' side before he can complete his sentence. Covering up his pain, he chuckled. 

""How about you, Harry? Are the boys treating you well?"" Lilith asked.

""O-Oh yes, Mrs. Z-Zabini."" Flustered over her name, she smiled at his effort. 

""I hope you were a gentleman towards Rose, Blaise.""

""Of course, mother. I'd never do anything rude to my new friend."" Staring at Rose, she was flustered and looked back down at her plate. Blaise smiled, making Lilith smile a little too widely. 

""Don't get any ideas, Lilith."" 

""I was only smiling, Sirius.""

""I'm sure you were..."" 

""How wonderful to know everyone is getting along."" Narcissa smiled triumphantly as her husband nodded. 

From questions to compliments, the twins were a little overwhelmed by the amount of attention everyone was giving them. It was odd to have so many people interested in them, but it was quite welcoming. They were ready to have a few glares or cold stares come their way, but nothing like the sort has happened. 

Much like their new friends, their parents were all very nice to them and calling them endearing nicknames. 


'Everyone is so nice...'



'Yeah, they are. They aren't like anyone when we went to school...'



'Even the adults didn't like us...'



'Yeah...'


""Are you two alright?"" Theodore asked. Harry and Rose were staring at one another for quite a while and smiling. 

""Theo, it isn't polite to stare."" Cellica reprimanded, making Theo flustered.

""I-I wasn't-! I just happened to notice they were blanking out, is all...""

""Oh, you needn't worry about that, Theo. They tend to do that a lot; they were talking to each other."" Remus explained.

""But they weren't talking...""

""Telepaths, perhaps?""

A deep gruff voice spoke, making the twins look to see who it was. A large man sitting in between Vincent and Parrish stared at the two. The way he was staring at them intimidated them for a moment, but they can tell he wasn't glaring at them. Thinking the man was scaring the twins, Parrish nudged the large man making him soften his expression and shyly smiling at the two. The twins shyly smiled back at the man; he seemed nice. If they had remembered correctly, he was Vincent's father- Emmit Crabbe and the man beside him was Gregory's father- Parrish Goyle. 

""They won't bite, sweethearts. They may look scary because they're bigger, but they are both big softies."" Ravenna chuckled as she saw her husband and Emmit flush at her comment. 

""Unlike Parrish, Emmit always seems to look like he's mad at someone."" Amaryllis furrowing her brows, imitating Emmit. 

""Perhaps it's permanent due to his constant furrowing."" Lilith teased.

""You've cracked the mystery!"" Percival snapped. Emmit rolled his eyes at their teasing whilst everyone got a good chuckle out of it. Unlike distracted adults, the children were all fascinated by the twins' ability to speak telepathically. 

""Wow, you two are telepaths?! That's wicked!"" Theo grinned. 

""Can you speak to us?"" Blaise asked.

""What-!! If you can, talk to me first!"" Draco found it unfair how he already knew, but they wouldn't talk to him first. He was their first friend, after all. 

""Try talking to me!"" Pansy waved her hand to Rose cutting Draco off. 

""I was first!""

""Draco, sit back down!"" 

""Pansy, don't scream across the table; that's very rude."" 

""U-Uhm... we don't know-how with other people..."" Trying to calm the children, Rose tried to explain. 

""We tried it with Padfoot and Moony but couldn't."" Harry continued as they all calmed down. 

""How fascinating. Do you need to look at one another to speak telepathically?"" Lilith asked. 

""We aren't sure... we just do it."" Harry hadn't thought about how far they can speak to one another. Thinking about the times they've spoken to one another telepathically, they've always happened to be staring at each other. 

""They get more fascinating the more I hear about them."" Lilith laughed 

""They aren't a side attraction, Lilith."" 

""You and your protectiveness, you know I merely tease."" 

Snape looked around the table and saw the children were growing restless in their seats. Haven finished their meal minutes ago, and their excitement towards the twins, he leaned to Narcissa, saying the children should perhaps be excused. Looking around, she chuckled.

""Children, if you have finished, you are all excused."" Not staying a minute later, they all fled out of their seats and rushed to the twins. 

""Pansy-! Don't pull on Rose so harshly!"" 

""I-It's okay, Mrs Parkinson. I-I finished my meal as well."" 

""Theodore, you mustn't pull on others arms like that."" 

""Yes, mother.""

""I-I'm done too-!"" Sliding out of their seats, they let the others pull them back upstairs. 

Amaryllis and Cellica stared at one another and let out a heavy sigh. Their children tended to be a little too rough when they were excited, and their bursts of energy could be a lot to handle sometimes. 

""They all mean well."" Lilith laughed.

 

~~

~~

 

""I'm getting bored with this."" Theodore sighed as he threw down his cards.

""I think we've played every card game and board game you have Draco."" Blaise noticed the stack of played games on the other side of the room.

""What else can we play?"" Draco asked, sighing. Pansy and Theodore always got bored easily if they played the same game for too long. It was sometimes impossible to play with them. 

""Oh! How about hide-and-seek?"" Pansy suggested.

""We aren't kids, Pansy."" Crabbe scoffed.

""We are kids, Crabbe..."" Goyle de-panned. 

""Okay... ignoring the two idiots."" Pansy rolled her eyes. ""What do you think, Rose? Harry?""

""Uhm... how do you play?"" Harry asked as Rose tilted her head confused.

""What-!? You've never played hide-and-seek?!"" Shaking their heads, Pansy was in shock. How can they not know such a simple game? That needed to be fixed today. 

""It's really easy like the name says. We all hide, and someone seeks.""

""Okay..."" Harry and Rose weren't sure what was fun about this game.

""Theo is it!"" 

""Why am I, it?!"" 

""Because we said we aren't it."" 

""Since when?""

""Now! Not it-!"" 

""Nope.""

""Not it.""

""Sorry.""

""No."" 

""What-?! That's cheating!"" Glaring at Pansy, she stuck out her tongue and grinned. ""Harry and Rose didn't say-""

""They are excluded; it's their first game."" Pansy quickly interjected, making Theo pout.

""If you are going to complain about it, I'll count."" Blaise volunteered. Theo grinned and thanked him as Pansy muttered Theo was no fun. Turning around, Blaise closed his eyes and began counting down.

""100... 99... 98... 97...""

""Come on, Rose!"" Grabbing Rose's wrist, she ran out of the room, running off whilst Theo pushed Harry out of the room in the opposite direction. 

""...86...85...84...83...""

""Count slower!!"" 

Looking around for a place to hide, Crabbe and Goyle were quick to hide behind the large thick curtains. Theo had told them that they'd be caught quickly, but the boys didn't care. Leaving the two in their terrible hiding spots, he and Draco looked around the mansion looking as they asked Harry to listen for Blaise counting.

""He's close to 30.""

""These are all terrible places to hide."" Draco sighed as Theo kept looking. 

""How about here?"" Scurrying over to Theo, Draco and Harry saw where he pointed and chuckled. 

""It might be a tight fit..."" 

""Ready or not, here I come!""

""I always tell him that he needs to count slower!"" Hurrying into the large wardrobe, they covered themselves with the long fur-coats and slowly closed the door. 

Listening for Blaise's footsteps, they heard it growing louder. There was no way he'd find them so quickly, right? They thought wrong.

""Found you!""

""How in the Merlin-!?!"" Draco started to laugh as Theo was annoyed at how fast Blaise found them. Harry couldn't help but chuckle at Theo's outburst.

""You made it too easy.""

""HOW DID YOU FIND US FIRST BEFORE THEM?!"" Pointing to the curtain across the hallway, Blaise shrugged.

""Unlike them, you forgot to hide your robe."" Pointing to the black robe sticking out of the bottom of the wardrobe, Theo groaned, making everyone laugh. 

""Alright, time to find the girls."" It didn't take long for Blaise to find them, they were hiding under Draco's bed, trying to hide behind the draping covers, but Pansy ignored her shoes sticking out the side. 

""Alright, Theo, you're it."" Clicking his tongue, he turned around and began counting a little slower than Blaise. 

""100....... 99...... 98... this is how you're supposed to count Blaise.""

""Just count!""

""..... 97..... 96..... 95.......94.......93......""

""Let's go!"" Blaise smirked as he thought of a great hiding place.

""I know where to hide."" Ushering Draco and Harry to follow him, they quietly snuck downstairs and ran to the adults. 

It seemed like everyone had the idea to hide near the adults. It wasn't long before Pansy and Rose came downstairs to see all the boys hiding underneath the adults' table.

""No fair-!""

""We got here first."" Blaise smirked. Pansy stomped her foot in annoyance, but Rose pulled Pansy's sleeve to the large couch in the sitting room.

""He'll find us if we hide underneath it."" Rose smiled, shaking her head and pointed to the cushions. ""O-Oh!! You're a genius, Rose."" Rushing over to the sitting room, the adults chuckled. 

""Please don't rat us out, mother."" Blaise begged his mother as she chuckled.

""I can't promise anything, dear.""

""Mother...""

""Don't worry, Harry; we'll make sure you win."" Sirius and Remus grinned, making the boy quietly giggle. 

""READY OR NOT! HERE I COME- Crabbe! You were supposed to hide!""

""I did, but you saw before I can hide-!!"" 

""I see you, Goyle..."" 

""How...?""

""Shoes. You didn't cover your shoes."" 

""Drats..."" 

""Alright, I'm looking for the others..."" Ignoring the idiots behind him, he looked around whilst the children downstairs silently chuckled, waiting for Theo. 

A few minutes had passed, and they couldn't hear Theo's rambling or footsteps anymore. ""You think he gave up?"" Draco asked.

""I wouldn't be surprised if he did."" Blaise sighed. 

""Who said I gave up~."" 

""AHHHHH!!!"" Frightened by his sudden appearance Draco tried to stand up, forgetting he was under a table, and Blaise fell back, hitting his head on the floor. Both groaning in pain, Theo burst out laughing as Harry tried to hold back his laughter. 

""Y-You sh-should've seen your faces-!! AH HA HAHA!!"" 

""Theo, you-!"" Draco and Blaise sneered at the laughing boy as they all crawled out underneath the table.

""He got you good."" Lilith chuckled.

""Mother...""

""Sorry, Blaise, I asked her not to tell you."" Cellica chuckled apologizing to the boy. 

""It's alright, Aunt Cel."" Sighing, Lilith was taken back.

""Wha- and you were going to blame me?"" 

""Ha. Ha. Very funny, mother."" 

""Now for the girls... oh."" Theo was quick to see Pansy's ribbon peeking out underneath the mountain of cushions.

""I see you, Pansy~."" 

""....""

""You can come out yourself, or I'm coming in."" 

""How did you find me..."" Annoyed she was found so quickly again, Theo pointed to her ribbon as she muttered to herself, frustrated by her own mistake. 

""You found us..."" Rose chuckled, letting out a breath of relief. 

""It was getting stuffy in there."" Pansy agreed. ""Alright, who is it?"" 

""Draco."" 

""Alright. I'm counting- 100..... 99...... 98......"" Quickly making a run for upstairs, the adults smiled and went back to their conversations. 

""They seem to be having fun."" Remus whispered to Sirius. 

""Yeah, I'm glad."" 

 

~~

~~

 

Although Draco's home was large, it was quite hard to hide in places when many places were restricted for them to access. They were going to have to get clever with their hiding spots... 

""How about here?"" 

""He's probably going to see your robes again."" 

""What about here?"" 

""You found Vincent there!"" 

""Exactly! He'll never know!""

""I'll hide here."" Crabbe pointed to the large empty chest sitting between two large vases in the middle of the hallway.

""I'm going to the kitchen."" Goyle hurried downstairs, hoping to hide in the pantry. 

""I'd say that as an excuse to get dessert."" 

""Oh! This is a good spot!"" 

""You can't fit in there."" 

""Yeah... oh! Harry can!"" 

""Guess so... he is a little smaller than us."" 

""Harry!"" Whispering, Harry saw Theo ushering him over. Listening to where Draco is up to, he quietly paced towards Theo.

""He's counting down 50-""

""Here, we found you a hiding spot."" Glancing behind Theo, Harry's eyes widened at the spot. It was a cupboard...

""I-I-""

""We can't fit, but you'll probably fit since your smaller than us."" 

""I-I want to hide somewhere else..."" 

""Are you afraid of dark places?""

""... I-I-""

""I'm coming up!"" 

""Drats! Sorry, Harry, just bear with it for a few minutes!"" Pushing Harry into the cupboard, he shut the door and rushed to the next room with Blaise.

It was too dark.

""I found you, Goyle! What are you eating?"" Draco's voice was distant but clear for everyone to hear, but Harry was beginning to have a hard time listening. Everything was getting blurry, and the air felt thin- it was getting hard to breath. 


 'Freak....' 


Whipping his head behind him, he saw nothing but the darkness in the cupboard. It wasn't real- he's not there. He's not back at the Dursley's.


 ""You stupid boy-! YOU FREAK!"" 


He hated this. He was scared; it was getting too scary! 


 ""STAY IN THERE UNTIL YOU LEARN YOUR LESSON-!! THAT'S 10 LASHING FOR YOU, BOY!"" 



'R-Rose-!! Rose, h-help me-! I-I can't breathe-!!!'


 

~~

~~

 

""You aren't really trying, are you?"" 

""I tried!"" Theo retaliated.

""Yeah, hiding in the corner and covering yourself with toys was brilliant."" Blaise snorted. 

""Oi!""

""You found the girls first this time."" Blaise noticed Pansy pouting behind Draco.

""She wasn't really hiding..."" Draco chuckled.

""I was busy trying to cover Rose!"" 

""Alright, now I just need to find Harry."" Draco continued to look around as Theo smirked, and Blaise smiled.

""What?"" Pansy asked.

""Nothing~""

""Oh~ You found a good hiding spot for him, didn't you?"" Holding his head high, Pansy began asking where he was, but Theo said she'll have to wait and see until Draco finds him. 

Half an hour passed, and Draco was having a hard time looking for Harry. Theo was having the time of his life, happy to see Draco struggling to find Harry.

""Alright, I give up.""

""You can't give up!"" 

""Come on, Theo, where is he?"" 

""Nope! Not telling~!!"" 

""Theo!!"" Chasing after the grinning boy, they all followed Draco but Rose stopped in her track.


'...me-'



'Harry?'



'I-I can't breathe-!!! ROSE!!!' 


Hearing the fear in his voice, Rose panicked and ran after Theo. Draco caught Theo, but he refused to tell, making them turn it into a tickle fight, but Rose interjected, pulling Theo away from Draco.

""WHERE IS HE?!"" Startled by her sudden voice raise, Theo chuckled.

""Hey, Rose, come on, it's just a game-""

""WHERE. IS. HE?!"" 

""C-Cupboard, upstairs- p-piano room. Hidden by the bookshelf... a curtain covers it."" Letting Theo go, she ran upstairs, leaving everyone shocked by Rose's sudden change in attitude.

""W-What was that about...?"" Pansy asked, confused.

""Beats me... didn't think she'd take it so se-"" 

Draco had remembered what his mother told him and ran after Rose.

""Draco?""

""Rose! Wait!"" Utterly confused, they all followed Draco upstairs. 

""Harry?! Harry!"" Looking around, she saw the bookshelf and curtain. Pulling it out of the way, she saw the hidden door and opened it. Her eyes widened to see Harry hyperventilating and sweating.

""H-Harry!!"" Pulling him out of the cupboard a far distance away from the cupboard, she felt him shaking violently. 

""H-Harry."" Calling out his name didn't help as his eyes were unfocused, and his breathing was out of control. ""Harry, it's Rose-"" Suddenly grabbing Rose's arms, he gripped her a little too hard, and she yelped in pain.

""H-Harry, y-your hurting me-!""

""H-He'll hurt us! H-He's-!""

""Harry, n-no. W-we don't live there anymore, w-we're with P-Padfoot and Moony!!"" 

""P-Padfoot? M-Moony...?"" His grip loosened slightly as she can see he was slowly coming back to reality. 

""W-We promised r-remember? We said we'd stay together!"" 

""R-Rose...?"" 

""It's me, Harry..."" Jolting away from Rose, he pushed her away from him and looked around. Ignoring her slight pain from the fall, she tried to get Harry's attention. He wasn't in the cupboard anymore, Rose was here with him, and he wasn't in that house. 

""I-I'm..."" 

""I-It's okay, Harry...""

""I-I... I'm sorry..."" Fat tears rolled down his cheeks as he wept into his hands and continued to shake.

""I-It's okay, Harry..."" 

""I-I'm sorry!!"" Hugging Harry, he held her shirt and cried as she tried to calm him. Remembering what Moony did for her when she woke up from her nightmares, she whispered to Harry that he's safe. 

Draco saw Harry in Rose's arms and the open cupboard. ""Rose...?""

""D-Draco... can you get our Padfoot and Moony...? P-Please?"" Rose was holding back her own tears; she could hear Harry's voice in her head. 

Wasting no time, Draco rushed back downstairs as the others all stood in shock, confused at the situation. Theo and Blaise felt terrible.

 

~~

~~

 

""It's alright, pup. It's alright; Padfoot is here."" Pulling the weeping boy into his arms, Sirius whispered words of comfort to him as Moony pulled Rose into his arms. 

""Are you hurt?"" Shaking her head, he wiped away her tears. 

""Was it only Harry in there?"" Nodding, he glanced over at the small cupboard and looked back at Rose. Gently pushing her head onto his shoulder, he rubbed her back, saying she was such a brave girl. Gripping onto his blazer, she stifled back her new tears forming. 

""Are they alright?!"" Narcissa asked, worried as they came down the stairs.

""Slight shock, but they'll be alright."" Remus sadly smiled. 

""Severus, would you come with us, please?"" Looking to the Potions Professor, he didn't hesitate to follow Sirius out the door. 

""I'm sorry to say we'll need to excuse ourselves out first."" 

""Please let me know if you need anything?"" 

""We will; thank you for today, Narcissa. I apologize for leaving like this."" Shaking her head, she ushered him to follow after Sirius and Severus quickly. Bidding everyone goodbye, the doors closed, and eyes were on the remaining children.

""Explain. Now."" Lilith demanded. 

""W-We... were playing hide-and-seek..."" Theo started.

""Yes, we know that, but what did you do that you made Harry hyperventilate?!"" Cellica was not happy to see the twins leaving in tears. 


""Blaise. Explain."" 


""... Theo and I were looking for a hiding spot. Theo happened to find a good place to hide, but I said it'd be too small for us to fit, but it was big enough for Harry... h-he's smaller than us... s-so...""

""So you decided to stuff him inside?"" 

""W-We suggested it b-but h-he didn't seem to go inside...""


""Seem?""


""... I-I'm sorry, Mother.""

""No. You are not apologizing to me, Theodore Nott. You are going to apologize to Harry and Rose in person after they have calmed down. I am extremely disappointed in you. Had I not explained that they lived through harsh conditions and not to be so harsh with them?!""

""... Y-Yes and yes, mother.""

""Blaise, did you urge Harry inside the cupboard as well?"" Crossing her arms and staring at her son, he shook his head. 

""I-I... I didn't force him in, b-but I didn't try and stop Theo...""

""You know what you need to do, right?"" 

""Yes, Mother..."" 

""You will be reading and writing the first volume of Pureblood Manners & Etiquette twice."" Staring at her in shock, he opened his mouth to say it was unfair, but seeing her expression, he backed down and nodded. 

""Yes, Mother..."" 

""Don't be so harsh with them, Cellica. Lilith. 

They didn't know, and I'm sure they didn't mean any harm, right boys?"" Narcissa asked.

""N-No! W-We didn't mean to!""

""T-Truly, p-please believe us, Mother!"" 

""M-Mummy... A-Am I in trouble too?"" Pansy asked nervously. Amaryllis sadly smiled hearing Pansy call her- Mummy. She only ever called her that when she was scared or nervous. 

""Not you aren't, sweetheart, but do you understand why I asked you not to be so harsh with them? You don't need to treat them like glass, but you need to be a little more patient and to understand them.""

""Well, what happened has happened. Nothing we can do but try and fix it in the present and future."" Percival tried breaking the tense atmosphere. 

Sighing, Cellica stared at her son and embraced him. ""I'm sure you were frightened; I'm sorry, Theo, but what you did was not acceptable. I truly am cross with you.""

""I understand, Mother.""

""You'd only need to write it once, Blaise.""

""T-Thank you, Mother."" Sighing a little at the decrease in his punishment, she stroked the top of his head. 

""I hope you go and apologize to them as well.""

""Of course, Mother.""

""That's my son."" 

""Well, it seems like we'll need to meet on another day. Hopefully better than today."" Lucius said as everyone agreed. 

""Today was quite eventful..."" 

""Now you decide to speak-!"" 

""Twice in one day. That's a record."" 

""How did he even pass his classes?"" 

""I think most of the Professors' were convinced he's mute.""

Apologies for the wordiness in the conversations.Also- I tried to keep it as close as the family tree (canonically) but I had to make up some names and a few things. I tried ha ha...

It's a full moon tonight-Remus has to leave for a few days leaving Sirius alone with the twins who are both in need of care & attention.

Sirius will have to be alone for the next few days with the twins and try to calm Harry from going back into a panic attack as Rose seems to be showing signs as well, but doing better than Harry. 

Lucky and unluckily for Sirius, he's got a helping hand from a certain Potion's Master.

Apologies for the wait-!Major writer's block, sleep-deprived and was a little busy- hope you enjoy this chap! Sorry, it's short.Thank you to anyone still reading this slow update story! ^^

It took a few hours to calm Harry and be aware that he or Rose was in no danger. Coming back to his senses, Harry was in tears again when he remembered gripping and pushing Rose, giving her a small bruise on her arm. Rose was quick to forgive her twin; she knew he didn't mean to do it. Cried to exhaustion, Harry had fallen asleep beside Rose on the couch.

Seeing the daylight beginning to fade, Remus was growing a little restless; he'd have to leave soon before the sun fully sets. Watching Rose fight the urge to sleep, he gave her a small nudge to relax into the cushions as he began telling her how she and Harry were safe and they had nothing to fear. It wasn't long before Rose was asleep. 

""Will you be alright?""

""Ye of little faith. 

I'll be fine.""

""Maybe you should ask Severus to stay with you for a few days until I return-""

""I'll be fine-! I'm worried about you-"" 

""You and I both know that you won't be able to handle them both when they have panic attacks.""

""Rose hasn't-""

""She's shown signs before. She may end up having one as bad as Harry did earlier today. Don't you remember just last month when she woke up from her nightmare?""

""... I doubt he'll want to help me.""

""Something tells me he'll enjoy hearing you beg for help."" Right on cue, Snape entered the sitting room with a potion in hand for Remus.

""The last one."" Handing Remus the bottle, he let out a heavy sigh. 

""The taste is really horrid; I can never get used to it."" Chuckling to himself, Severus paid no attention to it. ""Thank you as always for providing me with these.""

""Enough with the sentiments, and just drink before I force it down your throat."" One more heavy sigh, and it was bottoms up.

""You took the potion every day for a week, yes?""

""He did; I made sure."" Sirius said. 

Drinking it the last drop, his face soured at the taste, and he placed the bottle down on the table. ""I'm not a child.""

""No, but when you are living with children and had forgotten to take the potion last month-""

""I hadn't forgotten..."" 

Just last month, Remus had nearly missed a day of drinking the Wolfsbane Potion. With Rose and Harry constant nightmares, screaming or crying in the middle of the night to trying to get them to adjust to their new life with Sirius and Remus- thankfully, most of the time, the twins spent their time sleeping and wasn't aware of Remus disappearance. 

""... merely preoccupied.""

""Shouldn't you be leaving?"" Severus asked.

""Eager to get rid of me as always, Severus."" Ignoring Remus, Severus disappeared into the kitchen.

""Do be careful.""

""I believe you'll need more of Lady luck than I this week."" Grabbing his coat, Remus smiled at his friend once more and apparated. Taking in a deep breath, Sirius rubbed the back of his neck and dragged his feet to the kitchen.

""Snivellus.""

""Mutt."" Pushing down the irritation bubbling inside, the corner of his mouth twitches as he tries to keep his forced a smile. As much as he hated asking Severus for help out of all wizards, Remus was right. It is best to have Severus stay with them for a few nights. 

""I can't believe I'm actually asking for your help-""

Hearing a soft melody playing, Rose is roused awake. Rubbing her eyes, she glances around, a little confused but remembers what happened earlier today. A small shudder ran down her spine- just remembering Harry's desperate cries through their telepathic link and seeing the pure horror in his eyes brought back some horrid memories. She felt like she was going to hurl.

Desperate but gently, she pushes Harry off her shoulder and onto the cushions. Making a break for it up the stairs, she barely made it to the washroom as she let all she ate that afternoon into the toilet. Grabbing the edge of the bowl as she shook, she couldn't get the image out of her head. Just thinking about it had made her entire body react-

Coughing and trying to breathe, she felt a large hand against her back, startling her. 

""Deep breaths, Rose."" It took her a moment to realize who it was as she eased back against the toilet, and another wave of nausea directed her back to the toilet bowl. 

Rubbing her back to try and ease her upset stomach, Severus waited patiently for her to calm down. Flushing the toilet, he helped her clean up. If Rose were in her right mind, she would've been completely embarrassed that he had seen her throw up her meal twice. Dazed, she let Severus clean her up as he did with much care. 

""Are you feeling dizzy? Does your stomach still hurt?""

The words took a moment for her to process as she shook her head and spoke with a hoarse voice. ""No... M' okay."" Severus wasn't convinced; she was doing it again...

Asking her permission to hold her and with her consent, the two made their way back down to the sitting room but hearing Sirius' whispers of comfort and sniffling from Harry, Severus thought it best to leave them alone. 

Hearing the stair creak, Sirius saw a glimpse of Severus' robe- he hates to admit it, but he was thankful to have Severus here to take care of Rose. Remus was right; he would've had a hard time trying to care for both in this delicate situation. 

""He's co-coming for us-! H-He's..."" Wailing into Sirius's chest, he continued to try and soothe the hysterical boy. 

""You're safe here, Harry. You and Rose are safe.

It's alright.

Padfoot is here for you both.""

""I-I don't want to... I don't want to go back-!"" Clutching onto Sirius shirt, he continued to mutter pleas and about being punished. Sirius had never seen Harry so scared, not even when Sirius brought him home. 

""Padfoot is here for you. I promise I'm not going anywhere.""

 

~~

~~

 

Remus didn't take long to transform as he saw the moon appearing in the night sky. Grunting as he felt his skin stretch and bones shift, this was always painful no matter how many times he's done it. Allowing himself to take a moment to make sure he was still of sound mind, he let out a small growl and ran into the forest. 

Coming to a stop at a nearby lake, he stared up at the night sky and snarled at the ever-taunting full moon. He shouldn't be here, not when Harry and Rose need him. Hearing a twig snap behind him, he put his guard up, expecting the worst. And he was right...


'How rare to see you here, Lupin.'



'Fenrir... what are you doing here? This isn't your usual area.'


'I thought I'd take a long walk.' Walking up beside Remus, he made himself comfortable and took a seat. 'You needn't be so defensive around me.'


'Ha-! How ironic of you to say such a thing.



Who is the one who attacked me the first time we met?'


'Hadn't I apologized and said it was a mistake? Some were after my pack and me.' Growling at Fenrir, Remus got up to leave. 


'I had heard you took in a few pups under your wing- Potters, no less...'


'YOU STAY AWAY FROM THEM.' A deep rumble escaped Fenrir's chest- was that laughter?


'Are you afraid I'll eat them?'



'....'



'You really can't take a joke, can you?'



'What do you want?'



'You wouldn't believe me when I say it was merely a coincidence we met.'



'I hardly doubt it. You always have an ulterior motive.'



'I'm hurt you would think that about me.'



'Whatever you want, the answer is no, and I want nothing to do with it.'



'You and your pessimistic attitude, wasn't that Black's thing?'



'Stay away from our pups; this is your first and last warning.'



'I keep that in consideration, although I can't say I can promise you that. 



You never know what can happen in the future.' 


'WHY YOU-' Hearing multiple howls echo through the forest, both their ears caught the sound.


'I believe that is my cue to leave. See you around, Lupin.'



'Not soon, I pray.'



'Never took you the religious type.


Hope I can see these precious pups of yours the next time.' Leaving Remus alone, Remus let out a sigh of irritation. 


'I hope Sirius has an easier time than I am...'

Sirius isn't sure when he fell asleep, but his back wasn't thankful for it. Sitting up, he stretched out his cramped muscles and sighed in relief to hear that satisfying pop. He really needs to stop sleeping in such uncomfortable positions, but as they say- bad habits are hard to break. Stretching out his arms, he remembered why he was on the couch- wait...

Where is Harry?

""Harry?"" Looking around, he noticed the boy wasn't anywhere in the sitting room. Walking into the dining room, the boy wasn't there either. 

""Harry?"" Searching around the first floor, he was nowhere. Heading upstairs, he saw that Rose's room was open. Softly knocking on the door, he peeked inside and saw Rose was asleep. Beside her was Harry holding her hand and staring at Rose.

""Harry."" Whispering to not and wake Rose, the boy stared up at Sirius. ""I was worried where you went.""

""M' sorry...""

""It's alright. Were you worried about Rose?""

""... a little."" Looking back at Rose, he tightened his grip around Rose's hand. ""I thought she was gone again...""

Sitting on the edge of the bed, Sirius caressed Harry's head, trying to comfort the boy. He wished things could've been better for them if only he weren't taken away that day... if only he hadn't been driven so much by revenge...

""Padfoot?""

""Hm?""

""... You'll never separate us, right?""

""Never. 

You are both stuck with me forever."" Grinning, Harry let out a small giggle.

""Mmh... Harry?"" Rose was now awake. 

""Sorry, I woke you up.""

Rubbing her eyes and yawning, Sirius smiled as he caressed her hair. ""s' okay, where's Mr Snape?"" 

""Shame on that old bat for leaving you alone."" Shaking his head in disbelief, Rose let out a shy giggle. 

""I merely went to make something for Potter."" 

""Look at that; he appears when you speak of him-!"" The twins began giggling as Severus glared at the snickering man. Walking over, he asked Harry and Rose to sit up.

""The taste is quite bitter, but it'll help with giving you a good night's sleep and Rose, this will help with your headache.""

Drinking to the last drop, Harry was quick to feel drowsy as Rose felt her head clearing up. Helping them back into bed, they began drifting to sleep as Severus directed his stare to Sirius, 

""What?""

""Didn't I ask you, no- tell you?""

""Tell me what? Everything you say just tends to sound nothing but depressing and annoying.""

""Well, lucky for you, all I hear from you is barking.""

""Wait- did you hear that? I think I heard screeching."" Looking around for a non-existent bat, Severus's eye twitched. This man was an utter pain...

""Stock up on the ingredients from the list I gave you."" It was more of an order than a request. 

""Unfortunately, you are more decent at potion-brewing than Lupin; it's your responsibility to continue making them.""

""I thought that was your job, seeing as you're a Potions Master and all.""

""I don't have so much time on my hand, unlike you."" 

""Oh, I see."" Rolling his eyes, Sirius pulled the covers towards the twins. ""If you could do it, it shouldn't be so hard.""

""If I recall, you had made a cauldron explode in our second year.""

""That was fun."" Grinning at the memories, Severus was done. 

""Seeing as they are resting now, I'll be leaving now."" Practically shooing Severus away, Sirius was glad to know he was leaving. 

""Mr Snape...?"" Drowsily calling out to the Potion's Master, he gently patted Rose's head. 

""You'll feel better after a good rest, Rose.""

""Mmh... leaving?"" 

""Yes, but I'll be back when you wake up."" Promising to the dozing child. 

""I'd prefer if you didn't come back..."" Sirius clicked his tongue. Severus ignored the pouting man behind him and ushered the child to go to sleep.

""...night, sir.""

""Sleep well, Rose. Harry."" 

 

~~

Sitting alone with papers floating around and the sound of the quill scratching against the desk, the fire roared to life. Glancing up, a breath of relief escaped as Severus entered the classroom. ""I apologize for being late."" 

""Hardly, I was just getting started.""

""Ah yes, that would explain the pile."" Looking at the large stack of papers and floating around, a chuckle escaped as the headmistress leaned against her chair. 

""I wasn't sure you were coming at all.""

""I'll be leaving again by before dawn.""

""Looks like you'll be spending another all-nighter. Well, you are used to it, aren't you?"" 

""You are just as much of a workaholic as I am, Minerva."" 

""Sad how true that is."" Fixing her glasses, she chuckled to herself as Severus took a seat and a quill. 

""Seems like Dumbledore isn't helping you again this year."" Looking around at the numerous papers they had to go through, Minerva felt a vein snap inside her. 

""That damn fool-!"" Slamming the quill down onto the desk, Severus looked up to see Minerva fuming. He can't say he's all that surprised she is still enraged, but to see her lose her composure- that was new.

""He hasn't tried to go near the children, has he?"" 

""Not that I know of, but I'm sure Black and Lupin would've cursed him on the spot if he came anywhere near them.""

""Why I ought to turn him into a toad-!""

""A toad?""

""Well, I can't kill him!"" 

""At this point, I think that would be a fair punishment...""

""Severus!""

""I merely jest."" Replying with his usual monotone, Minerva wasn't sure if he was really joking...

""How are they faring with Sirius and Remus?"" 

""They've adjusted and seem to be doing well, except earlier today...""

""The reason you were late?"" Continuing with the documents in front of him, he explained Harry and Rose's panic attack. Minerva's hand paused and stared at Severus. Staring at the man, he looked up with a raised brow. Why was she staring at him as if he was the utter fool instead of Dumbledore?

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!""

""I beg your pardon...??""

""You should be with the poor dearies-! And Remus isn't home!"" Practically jumping out of her seat, she pulled Severus out of his seat and began pushing him out of the office. 

""Minerva-""

""You help Sirius take care of them, and I'll come by to visit once I'm done with this paperwork. Knowing Sirius, he probably doesn't have a few things stocked up. Go and grab anything you need before you go.""

""You can't possibly finish all of the paperwork alone-""

""I'm the bloody headmistress of Hogwarts; I've probably done more than the fool sitting upstairs.

Now then, I'll be bringing Poppy with me first thing in the morning. 

Off you go."" Pushing him out the door, she bid him a good night, and the door was closed in his face.


'I'll have to help her with grading when the semester begins...' 


Remus is surprised to come home and see it with so many visitors.

Harry and Rose are ecstatic to see Remus is back and tell him what happened over the past week while he was away.

It seems my creativity is slowly dying and writer's block comes and goes so my upload will be once or twice a month ^^;;BUT I'VE UPLOADED- WOOHOO-!! Apologies it's a little longggg and has many mistakes...-Hope you enjoy-!

Apologies in advance again for any grammar errors or mistakes- rushed to finish, I'll edit the chap another day!I wanted to upload this on Halloween, but oh well...


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

It was finally over. 

The agonizing week has finally passed, he can finally go back home. Spending a few days in that uncomfortable form in the forest and having to spend another few days in a ratty old shed sleeping to recover- it was much too long of a week. Harry and Rose will be wondering where he's been, at least he hopes they were...

Quietly waiting for the last car to pass by, he took a look around before appearing out of the darkness. Whispering a few words, he watched as the building began to rumble and stretch as the long-awaited number 12 appeared. Walking up the stairs, he knocked on the door; having forgotten his keys and hoping to surprise the twins, he waited. 

The door opened, and Betty greeted him. Welcoming Remus back home, he smiled at the cheery house-elf and made his way inside. With a deep breath, he let out a relaxed sigh. 


Home. 


""Master is in the sitting room with visitors.""

""Visitors?"" Walking further inside, he began to hear multiple voices overlapping one another. It seems like there were quite a few visitors.

Peeking into the sitting room, he was met with many familiar faces- although not unwelcome; he was hoping to see Harry and Rose first. 

""Remus, you're back! You look horrid."" 

""Nice to see you too, Lilith."" Laughing at the haggard man, she got up and enveloped him in a hug. Chuckling, he returned the hug. ""Have you eaten?""

""Not yet.""

""Kreacher! Get Remus a plate and a large cup of coffee- no... perhaps something stronger? Scotch?""

""If it's not too much trouble."" Lilith grinned at Remus's sarcastic reply and looked at Kreacher. 

""You heard the man."" With a stiff nod, he acknowledged Lilith's orders. 

""Yes, Lady Zabini."" 

""One would think you lived here, Lilith."" Percival chuckled as Lilith grinned. 

""I practically do with the number of times I've come here the past week.""

""I'd rather have Snivellus stay with us rather than you for another day. Please do go home and don't come back."" Sirius came in with two glasses in hand and welcomed his friend home. ""You're looking terrible.""

""So I've been told."" Taking the scotch and nodding in thanks, he took a seat as everyone welcomed him back.

""I take no offence; I know how you adore me, Sirius."" Sirius' face soured, making everyone roar with laughter. ""Always so difficult to reciprocate my love."" 

""I'll send my love from here, Lilith."" Raising his glass from the entrance of the sitting room, Lilith rolled her eyes and chuckled. 

""Speaking of... where are Harry and Rose?"" Remus asked as he didn't see the adorable rascals anywhere, and it was oddly quiet upstairs. 

""Oh, they had gone out to get sweets with Lucius and Draco."" Narcissa smiled as Sirius scowled. 

""You'll end up like Severus if you continue to scowl like that, Sirius."" Amaryllis warned jokingly. Sirius was quick to ease his expression and massage his forehead. 

""Like hell, I'll become like that depressing bat-!"" 

""You can keep your mutt-like face."" Severus sipped his firewhiskey, ignoring the giggles and Sirius' scowl.

""Oh, I think that's them at the door."" Narcissa smiled, hearing distant voices in the back. Remus straightened his back as he heard the door close. Small pitter-patters came running down the hall as high-pitched giggles echoed. 

""Padfoot-! Padfoot, is he back?!"" Bright green eyes came into view as another pair scanned the room and beamed, seeing Remus.

""Moony-!!""

""Moony's back!!"" The twins went running towards Remus and, without warning, jumped straight into Remus' arms. Sirius was quick to walk over and take away the glass as the twins attacked the haggard man. 

""Moony-! Moony-!!"" Remus felt his fatigue melt away, seeing the happiness radiating out of the twins over Remus' return. Nustling into their hair, he grinned and peppered them with kisses making the twin squeal in joy as the onlookers chuckled or cooed at the endearment. 

""Are you okay, Moony? Does it hurt?"" Rose asked as she did her best to cup Remus' face with her tiny hands. Chuckling, he nodded.

""Right as rain.""

""Padfoot said you were sick. Did you take Mr Snape's potions? They helped us."" Severus smiled behind his glass as Harry continued about how good his potions were. He already knew how effective they were, but it was nice to know that the twins appreciated his craft in a sense. 

""Yes, Severus did help me."" 

""It hurt less?"" Rose asked worriedly. Remus smiled and caressed the twins' heads, trying to ease their worries. 

""I do need a shower, a good shave, and a little food, but I'm alright now.""

""--Promise?""

""Promise."" Holding out his pinky, the twins grabbed it and smiled in relief. 

""Oh-! We got Remus a get-well gift!"" Harry jumped out of Remus's lap as Rose slid over to sit in between Remus and Sirius. Lucius handed Harry the gift and scurried back to Remus. The onlookers couldn't help but coo at the twins. 

""We must have another one, Percival."" Amaryllis cooed as her husband smiled, kissing his wife on the cheek. 

""We can try, my dear.""

""Goodness, you two, get a room."" Lilith rolled her eyes at the loving couple whilst Parrish glanced over to his wife. She caught his glance and gave a shy giggle, leaning against his arm; the large man's cheeks grew warm as he diverted his attention back to his empty teacup. 

""Oh, my Lady's luck, who would've thought Parrish the type-!"" Amaryllis chuckled as the man's blush disappeared and poured himself another cup of tea.

""Amaryllis, you must stop teasing him so much. This is why he barely speaks with us."" Cellica smiled.

Harry held out the gift, ""For you."" Handing Remus the neatly-wrapped gift, he ruffled Harry's hair in thanks and patted Rose's head. Looking at the gift, he heard a muffled giggle. Glancing up, he saw that Lucius was trying to hold back his laughter- what is that wretched snake laughing about?

Opening up the gift, he undid the wrapping, and inside was... unexpected. 

Lifting the gift, the others all looked away and quietly giggled at the gift. It was the sentiment that counted, right? 

Harry and Rose had gotten a Remus, a large grey wolf plush. Oh, the irony...

""Is this... for me?""

""We call him Grey! He'll keep you safe like ours."" Referring to their toys that they were gifted not too long ago, Remus found the gift adorable, although he wasn't all that thrilled about the teasing giggles in front of him. 

""Thank you; I'll take good care of him."" Beaming with joy, Harry and Rose glanced at one another and smiled. Their gift was a success; Uncle Luci was right. Remus did like it, but as asked, they'll keep that a secret from Moony- although they aren't sure why Uncle Luci was chuckling when he suggested the gift. Was there a joke they didn't understand? They'll have to ask another time. 

""How was your week with Severus?"" Remus asked Sirius as he was handed back his glass. Setting his new friend onto his right, he ignored the chuckles from the others. 

""Tolerable."" Sirius mumbled.

""How surprising."" Looking to Severus for his answer, the man hummed in acknowledgement. It was indeed tolerable- it was all thanks to their number of visitors over the week, even if they did become quite irritating by the end of the week...

 

~~

 (A week prior) 


 

""Master, the young master, and young lady have visitors.""

Looking up from his paper, he set his cup of tea down and went to the parlour of the awaiting visitors. Betty went off to get tea for the visitors as Sirius lazily welcomed them. 

""A little early, don't you think?"" 

""Nonsense, it's already 9 o'clock. We thought we could all go out for breakfast."" Leaning against the cushions, the lady smiled at Sirius. 

""Apologies, Sirius."" 

""It's alright, Cellica; I know the real reason why you are both here."" Glancing over at the two boys, they flinched at Sirius' gaze. Cellica nudged her son as Lilith did the same. 

Barely audible, Theodore asked if they could speak with the twins; Sirius smiled. ""They're still asleep. They had a rough time last night; you may have to wait a while."" 

The boys nodded. Lilith ushered Sirius to take a seat, ""While we wait, why don't we have tea together?""

""I hadn't realized I was the guest."" 

""Why, of course, Sirius. How else can I get you close to feel my love for you."" 

""I'll keep wary of your love. I don't want it to kill me as it did with your late husband."" Laughing, she tilted her hand towards Cellica as a small pitcher began to pour milk into her cup. 

""Thank you, Lilith.""

""Boys? Milk or sugar?"" 

""Two sugars, please.""

""None for me, mother.""

""It was a full moon last night. Had Remus left?""

""He did.""

""They know about his condition yet?""

""No, I won't tell them until they are older. They have enough to deal with; I want them to focus on eating and sleeping properly. Enjoy their childhood.""

""As they should.""

""Wasn't Severus with you?"" Cellica asked, looking around for the Potion's Master.

""He left to who knows where and came back not a half an hour later to have disappeared again."" Waving his hand around in annoyance, Lilith smiled behind her cup.

""It's nice to know you both getting along.""

""Hardly, Lilith.""

""Sirius."" It seems like Lilith can grow serious, and here Sirius thought she was all play and no work. ""We know it's none of our business as we've never been so close, but I think I speak for everyone when we all consider you and Remus, friends-""

""Yet here you are sitting in my house drinking tea with me."" Smiling, Lilith sadly smiled. 

""If you need help, don't hesitate to ask. We're all here to help."" It wasn't like Sirius was extremely close to Lilith or Cellica; if anything, they were more Narcissa and Lucius friends. He barely talked with them during their years in Hogwarts, yet here they are, acting as if they've been friends for many years. How ironic, yet it wasn't such a terrible thing.

""...Thank you, I'll bear that in mind."" Satisfied with his answer, she nodded as Cellica smiled. 

""Morning Paddy..."" 

""Padfoot..."" Sirius' face was quick to light up at the sight of Harry and Rose. Ignoring the man that appeared carrying them, he greeted the twins. 

""Good morning, my pups."" Pulling them out of Severus' arms, he blew raspberries onto their cheeks making them giggle. 

""Well isn't that adorable."" Lilith cooed as Cellica smiled at Sirius' affection. 

""Hello, Ms Zabini. Ms Nott."" Rose greeted yawning as Harry did the same. Setting them down on the couch, he asked Kreacher to get them a pitcher of juice. 

""Good morning Harry. Little rosebud."" 

""Morning..."" Harry rubbed his eyes as Rose was leaning against her brother barely keeping her eyes open. 

""Severus, did you wake them up? They still look exhausted."" 

""No, they were awake when I came to check on them."" Pouring two small vials into their cups of juice, they stared at their cups with distaste. 

""Mr Snape... is it that again?"" Remembering the potion they took last night, Severus smiled. 

""No, I promise. It's tasteless."" Trusting the man, they took a sip and true to his word they couldn't taste anything foul, only their orange juice. 

""Boys?"" Lilith called to her and Cellica's son, they were fidgeting in their seats. Hesitant to talk, they glanced at one another. 

""Perhaps we should give them some space."" Cellica suggested.

""I'll be in the dining room."" Sirius said as he joined the other adults in the dining room. The sitting room fell into an awkward silence. 

Rose was the first to break that silence, ""Sorry... Theo for yelling at you..."" Wringing her hands, she meekly apologized. Theo shook his head frantically. 

""N-No! I'm sorry.

S-Sorry, Harry, I didn't mean to scare you.""

"" s' okay... my fault-""

""No, it's not. It's my fault.""

""Mine as well. I'm sorry for pushing you in the cupboard."" 

""I'm sorry for scaring you."" 

""N-No! It's my fault.""

""Mine, too!"" 

""---I'm sorry!"" Yelling all at once, they stared at one another waiting for someone to talk but all they heard was a muffled laugh coming from the dining room. 

""Sirius...""

""Honestly... they are being sincere to one another and you are laughing at them for it?"" Reprimanding the man with a slap to his back, he was pushed further into the dining room. 

""I-I can't help it, they are so adorable- aha ha ha ha!!"" 

""Shut up!""

""Have you all made up now?"" Cellica asked ignoring the bickering people behind her. Theodore and Blaise did apologize, but they weren't sure if they were still considered friends...

""Yes, we're okay."" Rose said grabbing the boy's hands and holding them up to show they were still friends. Cellica chuckled at the boy's embarrassment.

""Shall we head out then?"" Severus asked. 

""Once those two have stopped bickering with one another..."" 

""We can leave them. Come, Rose. Harry. Let's get you changed and head out."" Holding out his hands to the twins, they followed the potion's professor back to their rooms.

 

~~

~~

 

""Rose, dear. Is that all your eating?"" Lilith asked worriedly. Rose had barely eaten anything of her English breakfast whilst Harry was still eating.

""M' full..."" Pushing the plate away from her, Sirius took the plate away from her sight. 

""You don't have to force yourself to eat anymore, sweetheart. You've eaten quite a lot, I'm proud of you."" Cleaning a few crumbs off her lips, she apologized for not being able to finish her breakfast. 

""Don't worry about it, pup. I can finish it for you."" 

""She's barely eaten, Sirius."" Cellica stared at the barely touched plate as Sirius shook his head.

""This is a lot for her."" Handing her a glass of milk, she took small sips. 

""She barely had 2 spoonfuls of oatmeal the first time we met."" Severus explained, ""She's made a lot of progress."" 

""... oh.""

""Padfoot, can I have Rose's plate?"" Harry asked as he held out his empty plate.

""I can order you a new one, Harry-""

""No, I want Rose's. I don't want new."" Handing Harry his sister's plate, he happily dug in, Lilith and Cellica glanced at their sons and over to the twins.

They had noticed this the first time they met the twins but the twins were quite small for being the same age...


'Harry, why not get a new one?'



'Don't want to waste...'



'Sorry...'



'T's okay. I won't be able to finish this either...'


""Harry? Rose?""

""--Yes, Ms Zabini?"" 

""How would you both like to go to the circus?""

""Circus?"" Harry and Rose glanced at one another. Circus? What's a circus? 

""Yes, that's a lovely idea, Lilith. The circus had just come to town a few days ago, they've just come from their tour in America."" Cellica had remembered her son mentioning he wanted to go to the circus with his friends. Perhaps they can all go together?

Not getting a response, the twins tilted their heads in confusion. What was a circus? Seeing the twins confused faces, Lilith and Cellica were worried that perhaps they didn't want to go or had terrible memories of such a place. 

""Lilith, you'll have to explain what a circus is."" Severus could practically see the word confused written on their faces. 

""O-Oh! Have you never been to one before?"" Cellica asked. The twins nodded embarrassed, they didn't know a lot of things. 

""You'll love it!"" Theo exclaimed excited, ""You can see cool things, eat a lot of sweets and have a lot of fun! I went last year with Blaise and Pansy."" 

Blaise nodded, ""You get to see cool performances and people.""

""Last year, I saw rings of fire turn into dragons! We also saw freaks-""

""Theodore.""

""But that's what they're called mother...""

""It's still rude to say so, Theodore.""

""F-Freaks? L-like us?""

""N-no-! No, I didn't mean you! I meant Uhm... Blaise help..."" Glancing at his friend in desperation for help, Blaise wasn't sure what to say either. Luckily Cellica was quick to explain.

""What my Theodore meant was he met people with oddities.""

""Oddi-es?""

""There are people who are born not normal... sometimes they join the circus to make use of their situation and people come to see it.""

""That sounds mean..."" Harry scowled at the thought while Rose wondered what oddities these people were born with. 

""It is, isn't it? Hence why we must be as respectful to them as anyone else. Just because one is born differently, doesn't mean we should treat them differently.""

""It's a lot of fun, let's go, yeah?"" Theo begged. They'd be lying if they said they weren't a little intrigued. Besides the 'freaks,' it did sound like it could be fun... Glancing at Sirius, he grinned. ""I think it sounds like fun, what should we do? Shall we go?""

""R-Really?""

""C-Can we?""

""I don't see why not. Of course, only if you both want to""

""We want to go!!"" Seeing the excitement in their eyes, Lilith and Cellica glanced at one another and smiled. They were determined to make sure that they had the time of their lives. Severus called the waiter for the check as the boys scarfed down their meal to quickly get a move on.

""Theodore, the food isn't going to run away from you! Slow down!""

""I'll floo Narcissa and the others, but Severus...?""

""Yes?""

""... Why did they refer to themselves as freaks?"" Cellica was interested as well making Severus sigh heavily. Sirius whispered he'd explain another time as Severus nodded in agreement. 

 

~~

~~

 

""W-Woah-!!"" 


""WELCOME. WELCOME ONE AND ALL. 



SEE IT HERE, FOLKS. THE WEIRD, THE FASCINATING, AND FUN. 



WELCOME TO THE CIRCUS!"" 


Confetti and firecrackers showered through the air as people ventured through. Left to right, there were games, sweets and many performances being held, the twins couldn't contain their excitement. 

""Harry! Rose!!!"" Pansy came bolting through as she crashed into the twins and hugged them with a wide smile.

""Pansy, dear, you must be gentle!"" Her mother reprimanded the hyper girl who only laughed and apologized to the smiling twins. 

""Hi, Pansy.""

""Hi. Did Ms Zabini invite you?""

""Yup! Me and Draco!"" Pointing to the others, Harry waved to Draco as Rose smiled. 

""Draco and I, dear."" Amaryllis corrected but Pansy paid no attention to the correction. Happy to see Harry and Rose again, mainly Rose seeing as Pansy was practically hanging onto Rose for dear life. Amaryllis hoped her daughter didn't tire Rose, Pansy was known to be too energetic. She hoped that energy would die down a little as she grows older...

""Sorry, we're late."" Narcissa apologized, ""Parrish and Ravenna had business to attend to with Gregory, and Emmit had gone to visit his mother with Vincent, so it'll just be us.""

""I can see the happiness radiating out of you, Sirius."" Lucius smirked.

""Hardly..."" 

""Let's go, let's go!!"" Dragging Rose into the busy crowd, Rose was flustered as she let Pansy drag her along.

""Pansy-!"" Grabbing Pansy's arm, Amaryllis let out a huff. ""You can't go running into such a large crowd like this alone. It'd make your father and I worried.""

""Sorry, mother."" Chuckling, Pansy waited for everyone to gather towards the entrance. 

""Where shall we go first?"" 

 

~~

~~

 

Harry and Rose were having a blast. Everything they've seen so far was exciting and amazing- magic was truly the best. From little creatures they've never seen before to outstanding performances- they were enjoying themselves. Lilith and Cellica were relieved to see the twins smiling and enjoying themselves. 

""Woah-! Look Harry, Rose!"" Theo pointed to the small gathering crowd as a man on a stand smiled and began to entice the crowd into the small tent. 

""COME AND SEE IT HERE FOLKS. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE HER BEFORE.

THE ONE AND ONLY- THE SNAKE GIRL!""

""Snake girl?"" 

""That sounds exciting, let go see!"" Pansy exclaimed as Theo was quick to agree.

""I don't know..."" Draco was wary of the so-called attraction. 

""I agree with Draco, maybe we-""

""Oh, come on. What's the worst that could happen?"" Walking towards the tent, they were blocked from the entrance.

""Sorry, children. You are much too young to enter and see her, perhaps when you grow a little older.""

""That's not fair-! We have the right to see her!"" Pansy screeched as the man only chuckled. 

""Sorry young ones. Much too frightening for little ones like yourselves. Another time, run along now, there are other things to see. Enjoy yourself with some other attraction."" Drawing the curtains, two more men came out and guarded the entrance making it impossible for the kids to get past. Pansy sneered at the men who only chuckled at Pansy whilst the boys pulled her away.

""See, that's what I thought, come on. Let's go see something else."" Blaise pulled Theo and Pansy away from the tent, but Pansy wasn't going to go without seeing this so-called snake girl.

""Come on, Rose!"" Wriggling out of Blaise's grasp, Pansy grabbed Rose's hand and ran back towards the tent. 

""Pansy!!""

""She's going to get into trouble again!"" Theo didn't want to be involved in Pansy's troubles but what the hell was he going to do? 

""Draco, go get Pansy. I'll go get Mrs Parkinson."" 

""I'll go with you."" Theo volunteered. 

""Come on, Harry."" Splitting into two teams, they went off as Draco wished Pansy would stop making their lives so difficult. They're only 7 for cripes sake. 

""Pansy, we'll get in trouble..."" Rose was on the lookout as Pansy was looking for a loose opening into the tent. 

""It's fine, I've snuck into places many times! Got it-!"" Smiling at her success, she slithered inside as she called for Rose to follow her. Rose didn't think this was a good idea...

 ""Come on, Rose! We'll miss it!"" If she can't stop Pansy, she'll have to just keep an eye on her. ""Oh, good. Harry. Draco, come on."" 

""Pansy, why are you dragging Rose into- Woah!"" Pulling the nagging boy into the tent, Rose and Harry followed unsure of what to do at this point. Entering the tent, it was quite dark compared to the bright light outside. 

""Gather around, folks and feast your eyes on our most popular attraction. Do not let her beauty fool you, for she is just as deadly as her looks."" Pulling the rope, the curtains were pulled away to reveal a lone lady in the centre of the cage uncurling on herself and staring at the people. 

Fascinated with her beauty, the children made their way through the crowd and managed to get a glimpse of the lady. 

""She's quite beautiful..."" Pansy whispered as she glanced over to the man from earlier. He seemed delighted everyone was fascinated with the lady.

""Surely this isn't it?"" One man asked.

""Of course not. Nagini."" Calling to the girl, she stood up and her body began to morph into a giant snake. Hissing, she launched herself towards the spectators getting a shriek and gasp. 

Chuckling, the man reassured the audience that she won't bring any harm to anyone. Slithering around her cage, a few more snakes came to join her as they slithered around her as if she was their master. Coming to a halt, Nagini stared at the two pairs of curious green eyes staring at her. With a small hiss, she stood up to stare down at the twins. 


'How curioussssss~



It's as if you've never seen an Animagi, before~'



'An-i-



Animagi,?'



'My~ You understand me?'



'Yes...'


'Aren't you lonely, Miss Nagini?' Small hisses vibrated out of the snake, almost similar to laughter. 


'How kind of you to think so, but I get by~



It's interesting how I can speak with you both in this form. I've never met anyone who can. I've only heard storiessss~'



'W...we never told anyone we could...'



'Quite a gift you have~'


'Miss Nagini, what is a An- An...'


'Animagi, pet. The ability to transform into an animal and back into a human at will... well, my case is different from an Animagi.


I'm afraid I won't be able to for much longer...' The twins hadn't caught nor understood everything Nagini said, but they understood she wasn't happy about it. 


'Why not?'



'... I'm what you call a Maledictussss.'


The audience was mesmerized and feared the twins and the snake. They were speaking to the snake in an unknown language, but it sounded more like hisses. 

""What dark magic is this?""

""They are speaking that snake-!"" 

""How is that possible?""

""Who are those children?""

""HEY! You brats, I told you that you weren't allowed inside-!""

""Time to go!"" Draco and Pansy yanked the twins away from the cage and began to make a run for it out of their hidden entrance. 

""U-Uhm bye bye Miss Nagini!"" They quickly bid the snake a farewell as she shook the tip of her tail to them.

'I hope to see you again, Lil Potterssssss~ '

Had they mentioned their names to Nagini? They don't remember saying anything about their names... how is it that everyone seems to know who they are? 

 

~~

~~

 

Running away from the tent, they crashed into a pair of legs and fell to the ground with a small oompf. 

""PANSY PARKINSON.""

""Busted..."" Pansy nervously laughed as Draco sighed and the twins nervously stared at Ms Parkinson. She looked quite angry...

""What did I say? Stay close and do not go far! What would you have done if you had gotten hurt!""

""Sorry mother.""

""Sorry is not enough, Pansy. And from what I hear, you snuck into an attraction that you were not allowed into?""

""I didn't sneak in alone~""

""PANSY PARKINSON!""

""... I had Draco, Harry, and Rose."" Mumbling her defence, Amaryllis rubbed the bridge of her nose and let out a huff. Her daughter was too much of a troublemaker, she didn't know what she was going to do. 

""Now, now, Amaryllis. They aren't hurt and they didn't cause too much trouble."" Narcissa tried to ease Amaryllis's frustration.

""Let's not let this ruin the children's fun."" Lilith smiled.

""Try and ease your anger, my dear. It's a good thing she isn't hurt."" 

""... You are sticking close."" Amaryllis sternly spoke as she held out her hand to her daughter. Percival chuckled as he looked down to Pansy, ""Be sure to ready yourself for punishment from your mother, Pansy."" 

""Oh boo..."" Taking her mother's hand, she was dragged off to where Theo and Blaise were waiting with Cellica. 

""Are you alright, dears?"" Narcissa asked as she began inspecting the three.

""We're fine, mother, but we did get to see something fascinating.""

""I'm sure you did.""

""Mother really-! They-"" Harry and Rose tugged on the hem of Draco's shirt. Glancing back to see the twins hesitant to speak, he caught on quick.

""What was it, Draco?""

""U-Uhm... well n-nothing I haven't seen before but Harry and Rose, their faces lit up when we saw the Animagi!"" 

""How fascinating. You here that, Sirius? You can join the circus."" Lilith smiled. 

""I'll pass."" Ignoring the twitch in his eye, Sirius brushed off Lilith's comment as Severus raised a brow.

""You'd be a fantastic part of the troupe. One man-dog show."" 

""Bite me.""

""He may have rabies."" Lucius pulled Severus away from Sirius, ""Surely you've taken all your shots?"" Sirius was ready to beat these two to the ground. Lilith was laughing away as Narcissa chuckled, they didn't know how to be friendly to one another. 

""Mother?""

""What is it, Draco?"" 

""I think Harry and Rose are tired..."" Glancing at the twins, they did look exhausted. Perhaps it was best to end their little outdoor adventure here. 

""Why don't we head on home? The poor dears are looking quite exhausted."" Narcissa interrupted the bickering men as they looked to see the twins lazily smiling at them. 

""Quite right.""

""Pups."" Calling out to his god-children, they ran over to Sirius. ""Let's go home.""

""A-already?"" Harry asked disappointed. Sirius chuckled as the small boy let out a small yawn.

""We can always come back again. You're both quite tired.""

""N-No... we're not..."" Trying to convince Sirius they weren't tired, Harry and Rose held out their arms to show they were still full of energy. It didn't take long for them to yawn and rub their eyes. Sirius held out his arms to Harry as Severus leaned down towards Rose. 

""I'm sure you aren't."" Severus picked Rose up in his arms and began to pat her back. It was beginning to lull her to sleep. 

""Can we come back again... with everyone?"" 

""Of course you can."" Sirius was glad to know they wanted to come back and with everyone nonetheless. 

""Did you have fun today?"" Severus asked. 

""Mmh... a lot...""

""Lots of fun...""

""thank you Ms Za...ini...""

""Than..k you Ms... Nott..."" Finally passed out, Severus urged that they all get going whilst Lilith and Cellica couldn't help but chuckle at Rose and Harry's sleepy mutters of thanks to them.

""Anytime, sweetlings."" 

""I'm glad you had fun today."" 

 

 

~~

~~

 

""Rose~! I came to play!!""

""Mmh..."" 

""Rose~ Rose!!"" Shaking the drowsy child, she groaned as her eyes cracked open to see who was trying to wake her up. Allowing her eyes to adjust to the morning light, she saw a blurry figure and a familiar colour of ribbons. Green ribbons... there was only one person she knew who wore green ribbons in her hair- not that she knew many people.

""...Pansy...?""

Smiling brightly, Pansy held out her arms to emphasize her happiness and bid Rose good morning. Still half asleep, Rose looked around the room and back at Pansy. Giggling at Rose's confusion, she held out her hands wanting to help her out of bed.

Taking the offered hand, she slid off the bed and fell to the floor with a soft thud. Sitting on the small rug, she yawned and rubbed her eyes. Did she say she was coming to visit today? Al; Rose could remember was the circus they all visited and Pansy getting in trouble, nothing much after that... wait Pansy got in trouble, so how she here? 

""Pansy? You didn't get in trouble?""

Laughing she shook her head, ""Mother only scolded me, but that's it!"" 

""Pansy Parkinson!"" Opening the door, Amaryllis entered Rose's room, ""I told you not to bother Rose when she was sleeping.""

""I wanted to play with Rose!"" Smiling, Amaryllis huffed. Her daughter needed to be re-educated on her manners...

""I'm so sorry about Pansy, Rose. Are you still sleepy?"" Rose shook her head, she was now wide-awake and although she was a little startled about Pansy suddenly showing up yet she couldn't be mad about it. Someone came to visit her just because they wanted to play with her. Rose couldn't help but be happy about it. 

Washing up and getting dressed, Pansy dragged her downstairs. 

""Morning Rose."" 

""Morning little rosebud.""

""Did you sleep well?""

""Good morning Rose."" There were two voices she didn't recognize. Hiding behind Pansy, she peeked to see two older women sitting on the couch with Lilith and Narcissa. 

""I apologize, my dear."" One of them spoke smiling. "" I didn't mean to startle you."" Staring at the woman, Rose could see the affection radiating out of her. 'She looks nice...'

""Rose, do you remember me?"" Another woman gently walked towards the two girls calmly speaking to Rose. Looking up, she stared for quite a while until she remembered the woman, ""Poppy...""

""That's right."" Happy to know Rose remembered her, she smiled at the flustered girl. ""I came to check up on you and Harry.""

""We're not sick anymore...""

""Oh, I'm sure you aren't. Although Sirius is quite a troublemaker, he should at least know how to take care of his god-children.""

""I'm not that useless, Poppy.""

""I never said you were, Sirius."" Poppy chuckled. ""Merely a troublemaker."" 

""It's a gift I have perfected."" He boasted. 

""Truly... that explains why you and James had come to my infirmary more times than anyone during your time in Hogwarts. I dare say you both have the school record."" 

""Yes."" Sarcastically grinning at the success, Lilith chuckled as Narcissa shook her head at Sirius' idiocy.

""Rose!"" Harry's head popped out behind the kitchen door and waved her to join him. 

""I'll check up on you both after you eat."" Urging Rose to go join her brother, Pansy pulled the curious girl to the kitchen to join the others. 

""She truly does look like Lily."" 

""She does, doesn't she?"" Sirius sadly smiled. 

 

~~

~~

 

""Good morning, Rose."" 

""Morning Rose-!"" Theo and Draco greeted Rose as Harry patted the chair next to him. Taking the offered seat, Blaise smiled at Rose. 

""Morning Rose, sorry Pansy bothered you."" 

""I didn't wake her up! I didn't, right, Rose?"" Pansy pouted at Blaise's words but Rose smiled. Even if Pansy did wake her up, she didn't mind. She'd rather Pansy wake her up than the way Petunia woke them up; banging on the door and screeching them to get up or violently slamming the door open and dragging them out of their cupboard. 

""Uhm... who is that lady talking to Padfoot?"" Rose asked as the others all leaned over to see who she was talking about. 

""Oh-! That's Professor McGonagall."" Theo stuffed the remaining pancake into his mouth as Pansy sneered at his sloppiness. 

""She's the headmistress at Hogwarts, the school we're all going to when we all turn elven."" 

""Hogwarts?"" Harry and Rose asked. They had heard about it briefly from Severus, but never in detail. They only knew it was a school for witches and wizards. 

""It's the best school for witches and wizards, no matter what anyone says-!"" Pansy was quite adamant about it, ""It's where Mother and Father went when they were younger.""

""All of our parents went. We'll be going too."" Blaise explained.

""I'm going to be sorted into Slytherin.""

""Me too!""

""I don't see any other house I can be in."" 

""Slytherins!"" Laughing at their silliness, Harry and Rose glanced at one another. Houses? Slytherins? Seeing the confusion on the twins, Draco chuckled and explained. 

""There are four houses in Hogwarts, you get sorted into at the beginning of the year."" 

""Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin.""

""All of our parents were sorted into Slytherin.""

""Except for Mr Black and Mr Lupin."" Theo reminded Blaise.

""They were sorted into Gryffindor.""

""Is that bad?"" Harry asked.

""Uhm... No, it's not, but that's the wrong question to ask us."" 

???

""Slytherins don't have a good reputation in Hogwarts. We're seen as the bad eggs."" 

""Why?""

""Something about lots of death eaters coming out of Slytherin and Voldemort-""

""You idiot! You aren't supposed to say He Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken."" Pansy panicked as Theo shrugged. 

""It doesn't matter, he's gone. Voldemort. 

Voldemort.

VOLDEMORT- OW!"" 

Rubbing his forehead, the piece of toast fell onto his empty plate. ""Are you crazy?!"" Pansy whispered.

""He's always been a risk-taker."" Blaise shrugged, Draco sighed at his friend's courage- rather he should be saying stupidity. 

""Whose v-""

""SHHHH."" Pansy was quick to smack her hand onto Harry's mouth. ""You don't say his name out loud. Don't follow that idiot.""

""Who are you calling an idiot!?""

""I am. To you.""

""Like you aren't one?!""

""I am not!""

""Take that back!""

""I will not! Idiot-!""

""You're the idiot!""

""YOU ARE.""

""YOU ARE."" With the Voldemort business out the window, Blaise was quick to change the topic.

""Mother told me your parents were both Gryffindors. Are you going to go there?""

""...Not sure. We don't know anything about that."" Harry wasn't entirely sure what this house thing was. 

""Would it be bad if we also get Slytherin?"" Rose asked.

""That would be fantastic!"" Pansy interrupted. ""We would see each other all the time!""

""That would be fun."" Draco smiled at the thought. 

""But what if we don't get Slytherin?"" Harry asked. 

""It wouldn't matter, we like you both. No matter what house, we'll still be friends."" Blaise comforted the worried boy, ""You'd still be friends with us, even if we separate, right?""

""Y-Yeah! Of course!"" 

 

~~

~~

 

""All done, dearies."" Finishing up her check-up on the twins, they sit up and glance at the staring adults. They should've been used to it by now but it was still embarrassing to have so many eyes on them. 

""Are they alright?"" Sirius asked.

""They need only rest and drink a few potions to help with their growth, but otherwise they should be just fine."" Poppy reassured. Handing the twins a lolly for being so well-behaved patients, they sheepishly thanked the healer. 

""I think it's best we all head on home now."" Narcissa announced much to the children displeasure. 

""Already??""

""Mummy? Please, a little longer?"" Pansy begged, but Amaryllis shook her head explaining the twins needed their rest. Pouting, Pansy reluctantly nodded. She didn't want to leave already but she didn't want to see Harry and Rose in pain again. It scared the dear life out of her when she saw them in tears and scared that day. 

""Can we come to visit again?"" Theo asked.

""I don't see why not?"" Lilith smiled. Sirius lips drew to a straight thin line, ""Since when did you start living here?"" Ignoring Sirius, Lilith smiled and ushered the children to say their goodbyes as the adults did the same and disappeared. 

""Mind if I take a seat?"" Forgetting about the new visitor, they looked up to see McGonagall smiling at them. Harry nodded as McGonagall took a seat. 

""I haven't introduced myself, I'm Professor McGonagall. I'm the headmistress of Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards.""

""Draco said everyone went to Hogwarts..."" Harry remembered the other mentioning to Hogwarts. 

""Indeed they did. You will all be able to attend Hogwarts as well when you all turn eleven."" 

""Padfoot says our Mum and Dad also went... d-did you know them?"" Rose was too afraid to ask about their parents. They only knew that they looked like them but not much else. Padfoot, Moony and Mr Severus always looked sad when one of them was mentioned. 

The professor was the same but she still smiled brightly at the mention of their deceased parents. ""I did. They were quite brilliant."" 

""Really?"" 

""Perhaps you may be a seeker like your father or a brilliant witch as your mother."" It warmed Minerva's heart seeing the twins beam brightly, ""I'm sure you'll both love Hogwarts as much as your parents.""

""I-I think we'll like it, we've never been to school...""

""Never?""

""W-Well Uhm... we got to go a few times but-""

""...Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't like freaks like us going to school saying it was a waste for us.""

Pushing down the fury boiling inside her, she shook her head in disappointment. From physical to mental abuse, neglect and not allowing a child to receive basic education- Minerva was brewing up a few more things to say to Dumbledore when she returned. 

""But you are both not freaks. You are both special. 

A witch and a wizard.

And when you come to Hogwarts, I'll make sure you both enjoy it to the fullest."" 

""T-Thank you, P-Professor.""

""You can just call me Minerva, dearies.""

""Min...Mine-er..."" Having trouble saying her name, she chuckled. 

""How about Minny? Granny Minny?""

""Granny...?""

""Minny...?""

""Cute, isn't it?"" Chuckling at her own made nickname, the twins shyly smiled and nodded.

""--Granny Minny.""

""Sounds like it was quite the week."" Remus was glad the week turned out quite eventful. He did have faith that the two stubborn men would somehow be able to work together for the sake of Harry and Rose, guess he'll have to put that expectation another time. 

""Don't be so shy, Sirius. You enjoyed having me around~"" Lilith smirked as she raised her glass. Sirius playfully raised his glass and gave her a half-hearted reply, 

""Try and avoid coming back for the next 10 years, if possible.""

""You know that's impossible, Sirius. I can't stay away from those adorable children."" 

""Seems like I'll need to work twice as hard to keep them away from you."" Remus pulled the twins further into his embrace as Lilith roared with laughter.

""Moony?"" Humming in acknowledgement, he looked down at Harry. 

""Can you read us a story tonight?""

""Of course, pup. Anything in mind?""

""Granny Minny got us a new book, can you read us that?"" Looking over his shoulder to Sirius for context, Sirius chuckled and mouthed the Headmistress.

""I don't see why not?""

""Promise?"" Rose asked holding out her small pinky, Harry followed. Chuckling, he held out his pinky and wrapped it around their tiny fingers. 

""Of course. Now, why don't you both go off and play with Draco? I think he's been waiting for you both."" Harry was quick to slide off the couch and run to Draco as Rose gave Remus a small peck on his cheek. 

""Welcome home Moony."" 

""It's good to be home, Rose, dear."" Returning the kiss on her forehead, she slid off the couch to join the boys. 

""Pup?! No kiss for me?!"" Sirius wailed. 

""You heard her, Lilith."" Amaryllis smiled. 

""Pucker up.""

""Oh, that's it-! OUT!"" 

Yes, I've taken the circus idea from Fantastic Beasts and the crime of Grindewald and put it into this chap- in case anyone says anything about it. I'm aware that it takes place years before when HP came out so there.

Sirius had noticed that whenever he'd go out with Harry and Rose, he'd be complimented on how well-behaved and polite the twins were from strangers. 

Lupin had been hearing non-stop from Lilith and the others about how Harry and Rose were such good examples of angel-like children, wishing their children would learn from the twins. 

Severus had seen and heard it all. The twins truly were well-behaved and polite.

Wow, I'm months late with an update, sorry about that.I said at least once a month, I'd update but ha ha ha.... insomnia and writer's block isn't a great combination.I still need to finish the Christmas chap I finished about half of- oops...Hope you still enjoy this mess of a chapter! And Happy New Year- 2022!!Please let it be a better year and not another follow up of 2020 like 2021...

(UPDATE): wow 2022 is just part 2 of 2020 so far LOLL, hah what else is there to expect honestly. Just once can we have a calm year?

(UPDATE #2): I'm reallyyyyy late with an update- I apologize. QxQ


Well-behaved. 



Polite. 



Adorable.


Sirius heard the three words from strangers whenever he went out with the twins. Whether it be out on a simple walk, going shopping to the market, or shopping mall- the twins would catch the eye of strangers complimenting them to Sirius. 

Sirius would smirk, knowing how great his god-children were. Dare, he says his pups were the absolute best in the entire world. But, he did worry they didn't act the way most children should, although they can work on that slowly. 

""Oh-! Padfoot! Padfoot!"" Pulling on Sirius' trousers, he looked down to see Harry pointing towards Rose, hurrying after a young woman. 

""Pup?!"" In a panic, he grabbed Harry and chased after Rose, but slowly came to a halt when he saw Rose calling after the young woman and waving the item in her hand. A wallet. 

""Miss! Miss!"" Looking around to locate the small, shy voice, she turned around to see a small red-head chasing after her with a worried look. 

Catching her breath, she took a moment before looking up at the confused young woman. Holding out the wallet, she shyly spoke. ""You dropped this.""

""Oh-!"" Rummaging through her bag, she noticed it was indeed her wallet. Lowering down to Rose's eye level, she gently took the wallet and thanked Rose. ""Thank you so much, sweetheart. I would've been in trouble without it."" 

""Rose, pup. You can't just disappear like that, especially in such a large crowd. I would've been worried."" Sirius caressed her head as Rose meekly apologized. Smiling, he praised her for doing such a good deed, to which Rose lit up shyly, grinning at the compliment. 

""Is she yours?"" 

""Yes, she is one of my pups."" Grinning proudly, the young woman giggled and stood up, straightening out her skirt. 

""You have such a lovely daughter. She's so polite.""

""Why, thank you."" 

""You and your wife are quite the lucky couple.""

""Oh well, I'm not-""

""Thank you so much, sweetheart."" Thanking Rose again, she looked through her bag and smiled as she pulled out two lollies. ""It's not much, but I hope you can take this as a thank you."" 

""O-Oh, you don't need to gimme anything..."" Placing a hand on Rose's back, Sirius chuckled. 

""Pup, it would be rude to turn down her thankfulness."" 

""O-Oh... u-Uhm... t-thank you, miss."" Bowing in thanks, the young woman smiled at Rose's manners.

""And this one is for you."" Holding out the lolly to Harry, he gladly took the offered sweet and thanked her.

""Thank you, miss-!"" Grinning, the young woman chuckled. 

""Well, aren't you both such gems? They're so well-behaved."" Sirius smiled proudly. 

""I must run; thank you again, sweetheart."" Patting Rose's head, she bid the group goodbye and went on her way. 

""I think a reward is in order!"" Sirius announced, pulling Rose into his arms with Harry. 

""Reward? We have."" Rose held up her lolly. 

""As nice as a single lolly is. I think you deserve a fudge sundae."" The twins' eyes lit up at the thought. 

""R-Really?""

""Of course. 

Good deeds deserve rewards."" 

 

~~

~~

 

""NO, NO, NO!!! I WANT IT!!! I WANT IT!!!!""

""Goodness-!! Jonathan! That's enough. Stop it right now! You have plenty at home!""

""I DON'T HAVE THAT ONE!! I WANT IT!!"" 

""MUMMY, I WANT ONE TOO!""

""Darling, you already picked out a toy-""

""BUT I WANT ONE TOO!""

""Kenneth, I told you, no! Now put it back!""

""But I want this! You said I can get anything I want today!""

""It's too expensive; please pick something-""

""No! You promised!""

""-MUMMY!!""

""NOO!!""

""I WANT IT!!""

Staring at the wailing children, Sirius looked down at his twins, calmly holding either side of his pants as they waited for Sirius to finish picking out jumpers for them. 


'Thank you, Lily, for birthing angels...'


""Harry. Rose."" Looking up, they cocked their head to the side in question. 

""Do you want that?"" Pointing to the popular toy of the wailing children, they glanced at the commotion and the toy. Staring at the scene and one another, they looked back at Sirius and shook their head. 

""No. We don't need it. We have toys, Padfoot and Moony gave us.""

Rose nodded, agreeing. ""We have enough."" 

Sirius wasn't sure if he should be proud of how humble they were or if he should be worried that they thought the few toys they had at home were enough for them. Toys... if you can call it that. It was mostly all living essentials, a plushie they both had and a single bouncy ball. Now that he thinks about it, when he and Remus bought gifts for their birthday, there were no toys they could play with meant to be played with pure joy besides educational purposes... 

""Pups, if you want anything at all, tell me. Yeah?"" Nodding, he reluctantly went back to choosing jumpers again as the twins scanned the store before staring at one another, shrugging. 


'I should've maybe pushed a bit more...'


""Oh, gosh. I wish my child would take after yours."" Looking up, Sirius came to face a distressed middle-aged woman. Sighing, she stared to the right as Sirius followed her eyes to see a young child crying about not having a toy. He was wondering why he had heard sniffling nearby...

Chuckling, he politely responded. ""If anything, I wish they were more selfish.""

""Goodness, I wish the opposite for mine. Your children?""

""Yes.""

""I have to say they must possess more of their mother's features rather than yours. Oh! Not to say you aren't dashing, yourself-!"" Politely smiling, Sirius suppressed a twitch in his eye. 

""I'm their guardian.""

""Oh? What relation?"" The woman was so damn nosy... he might as well explain before she continues to drag this on and speculate anything ridiculous. 

""God-father. Their parents have passed.""

""Oh, I'm so sorry.""

""Thank you.""

""Were you close to the parents? Have they been with you long? They seem to be such lovely children; I'm sure they'll be such good influences on other children-"" By Merlin's beard, he wishes he could wrap this up already...

""Even though they aren't yours by blood, they are so well-mannered and polite! Such wonderful children. Must be their parents who taught them before coming to your care.""

This muggle was quite rude... perhaps it wouldn't hurt to turn her into a talking pig for an hour or two?

""Padfoot?""

""Pup?"" Internally thanking Harry for grabbing his attention, he looked down to see him holding up a puzzle box.

""Can we get this?""

""1000 puzzle. That might be a little difficult for you both. Will you be alright?""

""U-Uhm... we wanted to play it with you and Moony."" 


Ah, shit. Sirius truly loved his pups. 


""Of course, we can. Remus is going to love this."" Ruffling Harry's hair, he grinned at the affection as Rose came scurrying, holding a round-tall orange container.

""Padfoot? Can we get this?"" Looking at what she picked out, he smiled- it was Jenga. 

""Of course, did you want to play with your brother?""

Nodding, Sirius took the puzzle box and Jenga from their hands. ""I want to play with you and Moony.""


Flippin hell, he loved them. How could they be so thoughtful? 


""Shall we hurry on home and play a few rounds before tackling this puzzle?"" Enthusiastically nodding with excitement, he smiled and quickly bid the forgotten woman goodbye and hurried to pay for the items. 

Leaving the store, he glanced to see the happy twins walking beside him. Surely...?

""Pups?"" Looking up, he asked. 

""Did you both purposefully help me?"" Glancing at one another, Sirius chuckled. Perhaps he was overthinking into this; they were only seven-

""That lady was mean to you.""

""She was rude. Aunt Cissy said rude people should be ignored.""

""But Uncle Luci said they should have a taste of their own medicine...

What does that mean?""

Sirius wasn't sure if he should thank Lucius or smack that idiot for even suggesting revenge to his pups. Although that is what he'd do...

For now, he'll have to buy their favourite sweets as a thank you for saving Sirius from the irritating muggle. He may or may not have made her lips magically glued together for the next few hours as he left the store...

Nobody will know... Of course, he'll not be telling Remus. 

 

 


I wish my child would learn from them.



They are angels-!



They're much too selfless.


Remus always smiled at the thought of his pups being praised and envied. Although he'll never say it out loud nor let Sirius know, he felt slightly smug that Lilith and the others so coveted his pups. Perhaps he was just being biased, but his pups were indeed the best. Except... he wished they were a little more selfish. They tended to be much too selfless...

""That's not fair-! How come you get to eat the last strawberry?!"" 

""Because I grabbed it first! That's why. You were too slow.""

""I only got one!! It's not fair you get two!!"" 

Pansy and Theo were bickering with one another again. This was such a regular occurrence now. 

Lilith had invited Harry and Rose over for tea at her place. As well as asking the other children, only Narcissa, Lilith, and Amaryllis had stayed behind as the others all had plans. Unfortunately for Sirius, he was called to the Ministry to finalize a few paperwork regarding the twins, so Remus was their guardian for the day. Bidding Sirius goodbye, he hugged the twins tightly as they giggled at Sirius' pouting. 

Rolling his eyes at Sirius dramatics, he shooed the reluctant man off to hurry and go to the Ministry. Pouting, he left and promised to bring back sweets for the twins. Remus didn't have time to stop him; that man had bought too many sweets for the twins to eat. There were still an entire two cupboards full of sweets they hadn't finished yet.

""I wanted the strawberry too!!""

""Too bad~ You were too slow~.""

""M-Mother!!"" 

""There they go again..."" Crabbe whispered as the other boys chuckled at the two bickering as always. On the other hand, Goyle didn't pay attention as he happily enjoyed his dessert. 

Amaryllis sighed as Narcissa chuckled. She always found it adorable how those two would fight over the slightest thing while Amaryllis wondered where all the teaching regarding manners went. 

""Pansy, sweetheart, you shouldn't lie nor raise your voice so easily.""

""Wha-"" Clearing her throat, she lowered her tone as Theo smirked in triumph. ""Y-Yes, mother."" It wasn't fair; why did Theo get two strawberries when she got only one?

""Didn't you get two strawberries as well?"" Pointing to the two small strawberries cut in half sitting on top of her tart, Pansy shook her head. 

""Mine are smaller-!!"" Pointing to Theo's tart slice, two whole strawberries were sitting proudly on his tart slice. ""Why don't you ask Goyle for some? He has more than six."" 

""You know he won't share! He never shares food unless you exchange something!"" Stating the obvious, Theo grinned, feeling more victorious. 

""Oh~ I completely forgot. Well~ Too bad for you, Pansy."" Enjoying Pansy's misery, she screeched in annoyance as Draco and Blaise covered their ears, hoping their ears wouldn't bleed to death. 

""Sweetheart, that is no reason to raise your voice. You can have mi-""

""Here, Pansy."" Holding out their forks, Pansy looked at the offered strawberries. Like Theo's, it was one whole big strawberry. 

""F-For me?"" Harry and Rose nodded as they held out the offered fruit closer to Pansy.

""B-But you won't get any...""

""It's okay. Padfoot gives us strawberries every day!""

""We like it, but we have it every morning. You can have ours."" Warmly smiling, Pansy beamed as she thanked the twins. Theo shook his head at Pansy making her sneer at the judging boy. 

""Now they don't have any; you happy?""

""Don't be mean! You didn't even share yours!"" 

""Theodore. Pansy. That's enough; you shouldn't be yelling at the table and making a ruckus."" Amaryllis warned.

""Y-Yes, mother, sorry.""

""S-Sorry, Mrs Parkinson.""

Turning to the twins, she smiled, ""That was very kind of you both, Harry. Rose. Thank you."" Shaking their head, saying it was fine, she sighed. 

""How did you raise such wonderful angels like them, Lupin?"" 

""Truly, they are such angels."" Lilith chuckled, watching the two bickering children now quiet and eating happily. 

""I can't say I did much, unfortunately."" Smiling behind his cup, he saw the women fawning over how kind and selfless the twins were. Glancing over at the twins, they were shyly eating their dessert. Setting his teacup back onto the saucer, he held out one of his strawberries to Harry. 

""Ah... but this is yours, Moony."" Ruffling his hair, he urged the boy to eat his favourite fruit. It didn't take much to convince Harry as he thanked Lupin and nibbled on the red fruit. Picking up the last strawberry to share with Rose, he was a little taken back to see Gregory Goyle sharing the strawberries he had hoarded earlier with Rose. 

""GOYLE IS SHARING!!!"" Theo and Pansy were in complete shock. This was the boy who refused to share a single muffin when he had received an entire basket from his mother, saying it was for everyone. The boy refused to speak to them when they accidentally ate his pudding for two weeks. 

Rose didn't realize it was such a huge deal that Gregory shared his food with her. 

""O-Only one is enough."" Goyle stared at Rose for a moment before placing four whole strawberries on her plate. Nodding in satisfaction, he took her fork and stabbed the fruit offering it to the confused girl.

""U-Uhm..."" Holding out the fork, she shyly thanked him as he nodded in acknowledgement and went back to eating. Nibbling on the fruit, Pansy and Theo stared at one another in disbelief whilst the other boys were chuckling at the shocking scene they had just witnessed. The adults weren't all that far with their expressions, having seen something close to what they'd call a miracle. 

""They are good influences."" Narcissa chuckled.

""More like miracle workers."" Lilith laughed. ""I can see them in the future. Our children wrapped around their little fingers."" 

""Lilith, you shouldn't say such things..."" Amaryllis said as Lilith continued to laugh. ""Oh, Amaryllis, you mustn't be so serious. You know I mean well, and don't deny, they are good influences for our children.""

""Well, I won't deny that. I only worry about Harry and Rose becoming much like them."" Half-joking, Lupin chuckled. 

""I can't say that'll be such a bad thing.""

 

~~

~~

 

""We played that last time!""

""It's our time to choose, Pansy."" 

""No, it isn't! You chose the game last time, so Rose and I had to play that forever!"" 

""Was only like 3 hours!""

""Rose and I get to choose the game this time!""

""No! Harry and I get to choose!""

""Rose and I!""

""Harry and I!""

""Rose!""

""Harry!""

""ROSE!""

""HARRY!!"" Glaring at one another, they continued to shout at each other as Draco and Blaise pulled the twins away from the bickering idiots.

""Can you guys stop fighting for once..."" Blaise asked, unfazed by the situation but not entirely annoyed by their yelling. 

""You know it's impossible to stop them,"" Draco said, wondering if Pansy's and Theo's mother will be coming up soon. Their voices always got louder when they fought, so it wouldn't be long before their voices reached downstairs where the adults could hear them again...

""U-Uhm..."" Rose was at a loss. They were fighting again... Draco and Blaise said it was nothing new, and they didn't have to take them seriously, but it still didn't sit well with her. Nor with Harry. 

""How about cops and robbers?""

""cops and robbers?"" Pansy and Theo stared at Harry, confused. What was that?

""I've never heard that before."" Draco was sure he'd played every game there was in the wizarding world, but he's never heard that before. 

""It's like t-tag, but put into two teams. Cops and robbers. The cops try to catch the robbers before the time is up and keep them in jail. Robbers need to steal an item from the cops. 

The robbers can break out the captured robbers, but you are out if you get caught again.

Robbers can get cops out for 10 seconds with a bean bag."" 

Glancing at one another, Harry wondered if he might've suggested a stupid game, but they were quick to respond enthusiastically. 

""Sounds like fun!"" Pansy perked up as Theo nodded. 

""Never heard that before, but that sounds fun.""

""How do we divide the team?"" Blaise asked.

""U-Uhm... we can decide by rock papers shoot or flipping a coin.""

""Let's do rock paper shoot then."" Forming into a circle, they held out their hand and began.

""--Rock.

Paper.

SHOOT."" 

The teams were divided. 


Cops: Harry, Crabbe, Blaise & Theo. 



Robbers: Rose, Goyle, Draco & Pansy. 


""Okay, so how do we start?"" Theo asked. 

""Uhm, we can give the robbers a 10-second head start or just start as soon as they walk out the door.""

""Hmmm, maybe it might be better to give them a 10-second start."" Agreeing, the cop team began counting down as the robbers started to make a run for it downstairs.

""READY OR NOT. HERE WE COME.""

The following 10 minutes were nothing but chaos as the children were running around screaming and laughing in the mansion. The adults at one point thought something terrible had happened, but after peeking at the game the children were playing, they all gathered to watch the chaos. It wasn't every day they saw their children running around and playing like other regular children's.

""Give up! You have nowhere to go!"" Theo and Crabbe blocked Pansy to the corner as she tried to catch her breath.

""You'll never catch me alive!!"" Making a run towards them, they held out their arms in defence. Sliding right underneath them, Theo yelled after Pansy in annoyance. 

""GET BACK HERE!""

""HA! YOU WISH!"" Running in full speed, she taunted Theo and Crabbe but fell right into Blaise's awaiting arms.

""Robber caught.""

""Wah-! BLAISE!!"" Theo laughed as he watched Blaise push Pansy to jail- the parlour where the adults were watching. 

""Looks like you got caught, sweetheart."" Amaryllis chuckled as Pansy pouted. 

""Hmpf.""

 ""BLAISE, GOYLE, FROZE ME! He's going to get away!!"" Running to Theo, he missed Rose peeking out behind the table as she snuck to Pansy.

""Pst. Pansy.""

""Oh, looks like help has arrived."" Lilith chuckled. 

""Rose!"" Holding out her hand, Rose tapped it to indicate she was allowed to leave 'jail' now. Scurrying out of jail, Harry and Theo came with Draco in hand. 

""Wha-! You're already out?!"" 

""Run!!"" Pansy pushed Rose up the stairs. Theo quickly chased after them as Harry gently escorted Draco to jail and scurried after Theo. 

""Having fun, Draco?"" Narcissa asked. Draco smiled and nodded. 

""You're out, Pansy!"" Theo grinned as he dragged her back to jail. 

""Already, Pansy?"" 

""He almost caught Rose! Why are you here?""

""Harry and Theo cornered me."" 

""That means only Goyle and Rose are left-""

""Only Rose."" Blaise came to the jail with Goyle behind him.

""REALLY?! GOYLE!!"" Shrugging as a half-hearted apology, Pansy groaned. ""We're going to lose...."" 

""I think it's too early to say that."" Narcissa chuckled. 

""Indeed, you might have a chance to win this."" Cellica smiled as she pointed to Rose hurrying down the stairs with the stolen item in hand from the cops.

""She found it?!"" Theo was shocked that Rose had found the item the robbers had to steal so quickly. He was so sure he hid that well. 

Seeing her all her comrades in jail and the cops surrounding the prison. Rose froze at the bottom of the stairs. She was the only one left, and she had the item in hand. She only had to make it to the chair that Lupin was sitting in, the 'getaway vehicle. 

She was so close... The safe zone was in the kitchen that was to her left. If she could make it there, she'll have to make somehow it pass through the other side, and it's only a straight run to Lupin, and the robbers win. It would've been easier if there was another robber-!!

""Nice and easy, Rose."" Theo slowly inched closer to the frozen girl as she looked around to see the guys coming closer to her. 

""Be gentle, boys!"" Lilith reminded them. It was amusing to watch the boys trying to figure out how to capture Rose. They couldn't exactly tackle the poor thing like Pansy. 

""Theo..."" As if the boys were all thinking alike, they glanced at one another. Rose took that moment to run back up the stairs. 

""She's getting away!"" 

""Harry, guard the robbers!"" Blaise exclaimed as the others ran after her. Left with the robbers, Harry took a seat beside Draco. 

""So~?"" Glancing at Pansy, she smiled. 

""What are you in for?"" Laughter erupted as Harry tilted his head, confused by smiling nonetheless. 

Waiting for what seemed like forever, Draco noticed Rose peeking at the top of the stairs. Nudging Pansy, she beamed and quickly distracted Harry with random questions as Draco joined in. Seeing Harry delighted, Rose took the chance to speedily but quietly make her way down. Rushing down, she didn't notice Blaise hot on her trail. 

""Found you!"" 

Surprised by Blaise, she lost her balance and tripped over herself. Dropping the item out of hand, she was ready to take a tumble down the stairs. The children screamed as the adults weren't fast enough to react, but thankfully Blaise was quick to pull Rose into his arms. 

Theo was quick to pull the back of Blaise's jacket to balance the two on the stairs. Everyone froze for a moment before the adults came hovering over.

""Are you alright?!""

""Oh my goodness, that could've been very dangerous-!""

""Blaise, that was fast reflexes, but you could've gotten hurt as well!""

""I'm alright, mother."" Looking at Rose, he asked if she was alright; she nodded and apologized for almost hurting them both. Blaise apologized for scaring her and said it was fine. 

""Maybe we should stop the game here for today-""

""WE WIN!!"" Pansy grinned victoriously as she held up their prize over her head and stood tall on their 'getaway vehicle.'

""Wha-?! You're in jail! That's not possible!"" Theo yelled. 

""It so happens; we didn't move from our position."" Draco explained as Pansy smirked. 

""The item rolled to us, and Mr Lupin's chair was right next to us. There was never a rule that inmates can't break out of jail if the item was in front of us."" 

It oddly made sense, yet it was just so ridiculous that Theo gave up on understanding Pansy's explanation. He groaned and waved his hand, saying it was the robber's victory.

""Rose, you okay?"" Harry asked worriedly. Rose nodded. 

""Thank you, B-Blaise."" Rose shyly thanked. Blaise smiled. 

""It's nothing. Rose.""

 

 


Obedient 



Annoyingly too well-behaved...


As a professor at Hogwarts, Severus Snape preferred his students to be obedient and just well not a menace in his classroom or his presence. But there was one thing about being obedient and too obedient. If there were ever a time Severus wished a child would be rowdy and annoying- it'd be whenever he was around the Potter twins. 

""Severus, thank you for coming so fast."" 

""Not that I had much choice, Narcissa."" As always, that infamous scowl of Severus was plastered on his face as he stepped out of the fireplace. ""What was this emergency?""

""I need you to watch the children for a few hours.""

""... Surely you jest.""

""I'm sorry, Severus. I know you are busy, but nobody else was available.""

""Why not call those mutts-""

""They are otherwise occupied at the Ministry, hence why I was asked to watch the twins.""

""Lilith-""

""Everyone else is occupied at the moment..."" Narcissa heavily sighed as she began gathering her paperwork and shrinking it to put away into her clutch. ""I shouldn't be no more than a few hours at most. I'll be back as soon as possible.""

""Narcissa-""

""Truly, thank you, Severus, and don't worry. You'll be fine; the children adore you.""

""Only three of them...""

""Well, consider this a practice to getting to know everyone's children a little better before you become their professor when they go to Hogwarts."" Smiling at the scowling man, she chuckled and bid the professor good luck and thanks before she apparated.

Sighing, he rubbed the bridge of his nose. He may be a professor, but he wasn't exactly known to be kind to children... well, except for-.

""Uncle Sev! Mother said you'd come!"" Rushing over to Severus, he tried to soften his expression for his god-son. 

""Draco..."" 

""I had thought Mr Parkinson would come, but Mother had said he was called back to the Ministry at the last minute.""


'Right... Percival is an aurora- I had forgotten for a moment.'


""What of Cellica?""

""Ms Nott? Mother had mentioned something about helping Father with work.""


'Truly not my day today...' 


""Draco, Theo said to hurry up. Oh-! Mr Snape!"" Harry greeted the professor with a bright smile as Severus nodded in acknowledgement. 

""Who else is here, Draco?""

""Theo, Harry, Rose, and Pansy."" Severus had to stop himself from sighing out so loudly. If any children made Severus ever wonder why he ever became a professor was Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson. Those two always had a new way to give Severus a migraine to the next level. 

""Draco, if you don't come back soon, we'll be skipping your turn!"" That would be Theo screaming from across the hall...

""DON'T BE SUCH A CHEAT!"" And there was Pansy...

""Am not! And I should be saying that to you!!""

""You dare accuse me of cheating?!""

""You started it first!""

""Why you-!"" Ah, there it was. The migraine has already begun. It was going to be the most prolonged few hours of his life...

 

~~

~~

 

Much to Theo's and Pansy happiness, Severus had by some miracle got all the children to read in the library as he continued to write out his lesson plan from where he was interrupted half an hour ago by Narcissa. 

""This is boring~!"" Theo groaned. Burying his face into the pages, he splayed out his arms across the table, blocking the other side of the book to what Pansy was reading.

Slapping his hand away, Theo's eye twitched as Pansy scooted closer to Rose. Not batting an eye at Pansy, Rose continued to book that Draco had recommended to her. 

Theo's eyes wandered around the extensive library until he spotted a few blank pages of parchment not that far from him. A sudden idea popped into his head. Grabbing the parchment, he began tearing it into thin strips as Severus ignored Theo's shredding. Rolling the strips into small triangles, he leaned against the table and started flicking it to Pansy's head. 

Feeling a vein burst, Pansy turned to tell Theo to stop until another flicked against her forehead. Slamming the book shut, she began hitting Theo's arm.

""STOP BEING SO ANNOYING!!!""

""OW OW OW!!! THAT HURTS!! QUIT IT!!!""

""YOU STARTED IT FIRST!!!""

""DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN HIT ME!!""

""QUIT IT!!""

""YOU FIRST!!""

Rose tried pulling Pansy away from Theo as Harry and Draco began pulling Theo away from Pansy, but the two continued to bicker. 

""YOU ARE SO ANNOYING!!""

""I CAN SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU!!"" Dropping the book, she began smacking his arm as Theo tried to push her off of him. As the two continued to fight, Severus deeply sighed and stood to go and stop their bickering until he heard a small yelp and thud. 

""R-Rose! Are you alright?! I-I'm so sorry!! Theo pushed me and-""

""Pushed?! you kept hitting me so obviously your elbow-""

""You're bleeding-! Rose, hold this against your nose."" Draco was quick to try and stop the bloody nose as Harry was panicking about what to do. 

""M'kay."" Muttering through the cloth, Snape quickly checked up on her wound. Pulling the fabric away from her nose, he let out a sigh of relief when the bleeding had already stopped. Muttering a spell as reassurance, more for himself than Rose, he sat her back on the chair before redirecting his attention to the troublemakers.

""Miss Parkinson and Mr Nott."" They were in for it now. Their parents would always say their full names whenever they were in trouble, but hearing their future professor call them out in a monotone voice made it even worse. Of course, this won't be the last time Snape will be calling them out. 

""I believe doing some house chores should help you both with getting along with one another.""

""M-Mr. Snape, anything but that-!""

""That's house-elf work!!"" Pansy was horrified at the mere thought of it.

""You can either help with the house chores until your parents arrive or write 'I shall not make noise or cause trouble in the library' a hundred times and read the book you were supposed to read."" 

Both sounded horrid options.

""Mr Severus..."" Pulling on the hem of his sleeve, Rose tried explaining that she was alright and that it was an accident. She didn't want them to get into trouble.

""I understand what you are trying to do, but you mustn't stop one from being reprimanded if needed; of course, violence is not the answer for punishing one for their mistake or naughty behaviour.""

""Y-You won't hit them?""

""Never."" Caressing the top of her head to soothe her fear, Rose unconsciously let out a sigh of relief. With a curt nod, Severus faced the two shaking children. 

""As for you two, I believe I've given you two a choice. What shall it be?"" Glancing at one another, they both reluctantly agreed to write a hundred times. It was better than doing those gruelling chores. 

""Draco."" 

""Yes?""

""Go out and entertain the Potters. Also, make sure Rose gets an ice pack for her nose. Just a precaution.""

""Yes, Uncle Sev."" Pushing twins out of the library, Harry confusingly waved bye to Theo and Pansy. The two sadly waved back before two chalk pieces floated into their hands.

""Now then."" Two chalkboards appeared in front of them as he held up two step-ladders. ""Shall we begin?""


'--This is hell-!!!'


 

~~

~~

 

""Goodness, what happened to them?"" Amaryllis asked the two grumbling children by the couch.

""Being dramatic."" Severus replied.

Narcissa smiled knowingly as she helped Harry and Rose with their cloaks. ""There we are, dears. Remus and Sirius should be here any sec-""

""PUPS. PADFOOT IS HERE~!!!"" Just like that, he appeared with Remus right behind him. 

""Thanks for taking care of them, Narcissa."" Smiling, she shook her head.

""Severus took over today.""

""Oh?""

Sirius expression soured as he stared at Severus. ""How much did you bore my pups?""

""Mind your own business, mutt. It's not like I wanted to.""

""Tsk, why did he, out of everyone, have to take care of my pups?""

""Nobody else was available."" 

""I'd rather have Lilith- ROSE!! WHY DO YOU HAVE AN ICEPACK ON YOUR NOSE?! PUP?! ARE YOU ALRIGHT?! DOES IT HURT!!?!"" Panicking as he gently pushed the ice away to see the injury, she shyly smiled and shook her head. 

""It doesn't hurt anymore."" It was slightly red, but it wasn't anything serious, thankfully. Yet, that didn't stop Sirius from being overly dramatic and panicked. 

""Are you alright? That must've hurt."" Remus asked worriedly as he gently examined Rose's face left to right. 

""It's okay. It's doesn't hurt anymore. It hurt a little, but only a little bit of blood-""

""BLOOD?!"" Glaring at Severus, Sirius began barking at Severus for injuring Rose. 

""Quit your yapping. It was a small accident that Rose got caught up in.""

""Accident?"" 

""Young Mr Nott and Miss Parkinson were bickering amongst each other. Rose tried to stop their bickering and was pushed off the chair. I believe Miss Parkinson had elbowed her nose in the process.""

""Oh! I'm so sorry, sweetheart!!"" Amaryllis apologized on behalf of Pansy. ""PANSY PARKINSON. Your father and I shall be discussing your behaviour tonight."" 

""Y-Yes, mummy...""  

""THEODORE NOTT.""

""M-Mother...."" Silently smiling at her son, Theodore felt a chill go down his spine. She didn't need to say anything- he knew he was done for when he got home. ""Y-Yes, mother..."" 

""Well... seems like today was an eventful day..."" Remus nervously laughed at the tense atmosphere. ""I think it's time to go home, now, Sirius.""

""I'm not done with you, Snivellus."" Ignoring the barking mutt, Severus patted the twins head and bid them farewell. 

""If it still hurts, you can call for me, Rose.""

""Thank you, sir."" Beaming at the professor, he nodded, satisfied. 

""Watch after your sister, Harry.""

""Yes, Sir!"" Holding back a smile, he gave them a nudge to Remus and Sirius.

""We're talking about your babysitting qualifications, Snivellus-

DON'T APPARATE AWAY WHEN I'M STILL TALKING!!!""

 

Christmas will be here any day now and the twins are quite excited, although they aren't expecting anything, they are hoping that they can decorate a tree and have some Christmas pudding. That's all they wanted. 

But, of course, a certain godfather and his partner in crime won't be satisfied with just that, they are going to go all out for the twins. Even if it meant bringing the entire north pole to them.

This is going to be the first of many holidays they celebrate together and it definitely won't be the last.

Yes. It's February and I'm writing the missed Christmas chapter I should've uploaded last year...My apologies. I still hope you enjoy this pure mess of fluff and grammar is probably a mess but I just wanted to get this chap out.

(A/N): It's March, omg the time... where... how... forget it. All I know is that it's 2022 ha ha haI ended this chap so aburptely- I didn't know how to end it and I wanted to upload ;;w;;

""--Christmas?""

Harry and Rose glanced at one another as the somewhat foreign word rolled off their tongue. Christmas. 

""That's right, it'll be Christmas soon. Is there anything you both want? Anything at all."" Remus urged the twins to say their Christmas desires. It was their first Christmas together as a family, after all.

""Is there anything you want to do? Eat? Want? Play?"" Sirius asked. He was more excited to hear what his pups will ask of him and Remus. He'll make sure they both go over the top with whatever they ask. It will be perfect. 

""Mhmm..."" Thinking out loud, the twins weren't exactly sure what they should or were supposed to ask for. They've never celebrated Christmas before, only seen what the Dursleys have done. 

 


They were pushed into the cupboard as Petunia screeched how they had gotten their filthy hands on Dudley's gifts and almost ruined Christmas dinner. Giving them no chance to explain themselves, they cowered at their aunt's reprimands and the door shaking from her hands slamming against the door. 



With an irritated huff, she slammed her hand against the door once more before shuffling away to the kitchen. Grasping each other's hands, Rose tried to calm Harry as fat tears rolled down his reddened cheeks. 



Dabbing away the tears with her new shirt sleeve, Harry began murmuring apologies as he tried to control himself. Petunia had wanted them to set the table and carry the dishes to the table. Yet, they hadn't eaten in three days and they were already having trouble standing- it was an impossible task.  Harry had wavered from dizziness and dropped the bowl of mash; the bowl crashed onto the floor and Petunia was quick to raise her voice and slap Harry for his mistake. Almost having harmed Dudley with the broken pieces, she continued to slap his face. Rose was quick to drop to the floor on her knees begging Petunia to stop but she continued until she heard the timer go off.  



Calming Harry down, Rose heard the front door open and voices began pouring inside, Vernon had returned from the station with someone Rose and Harry also feared from.



""Where are those wretched rats?"" 



""Oh, I'm sorry, Marjorie, I'm afraid they are being punished at the moment.""



""Useless things you have, Vernon. What use is it having those abnormalities if they are of no use?""



""Well, we try our best to have them be of good use.""



""You know how they'd be of good use to you? You should start grooming them for potential buyers.""



""Oh?""



""Surely you hadn't been thinking of keeping them around till they were your age?"" 



""O-Of course not! Out of the question-!!! B-But, surely you know I cannot just throw them out to the streets, Marjorie...""



Slapping Vernon's arm, she huffed at his obvious statement. ""I know that you fool! Now, where is the nephew of mine, Oh! Dudley!! My, how you are growing!!!"" Kissing Dudley whilst he continued to stuff his face with sweets, Vernon dragged in her suitcase and bags of gifts. 



Hearing Marjorie's voice, Harry felt tears beginning to well up in his eyes again as Rose began praying that they'd stayed inside the cupboard all night. That would've been a mercy compared to being around Marjorie. That wishful mercy was cut short when the cupboard door began rattling violently with loud barks. 



""Ripper!! Ripper, darling, you mustn't be so loud. You are scaring our precious Dudley."" Softly reprimanding the loud mutt, it grunted in response and sat in front of the cupboard door growling at the twins inside. 



Time passed and the twins can hear laughter and chatter going in the dining room as the delicious smell of Petunia's Christmas cooking passed through the cracks. Ignoring their growling stomachs, they tried to focus on warming each other with the thin rag over them.



'It... smells so good.'



'Yeah... wish just a piece.'



'Wish Aunt Petunia gave us bread today... I'm so hungry...'



'Drink some water, Harry, you didn't drink yesterday too.'



'But... you too.'



'I drink yesterday.'



'...'



Not having the energy to argue, he reluctantly took the last few sips of water they've saved up. Rose weakly smiled satisfied until the door pulled open with Vernon's face snarling at them. 



""Get up, you lazy filths! Clean up the table and don't think about taking any of the leftovers!!"" Dragging them out and tossing them into the dining room, they wasted no time doing their chore. The food was so tempting, but they knew better than to even dare take a piece. Rose had tried to take only an apple for Harry but had gotten the belt and fire poker.



The table now clean, they moved onto the dishes and tried to be as discreet about it as possible not wanting to anger anyone else. Although, they always find any small reason to punish them. Placing the washed dishes into the dishwasher, Harry's eyes caught the decorated tree with the many gifts and saw Dudley happily digging into them. 



Feeling a twinge of jealousy at all the gifts for Dudley, he lost his grip on the plate and dropped it on the floor. Rose was quick to quickly help Harry with the broken pieces but Petunia began storming towards them shrieking about her precious china. Raising her hand to strike the twins, Marjorie was quick to stop her and suggest something else. 



""Kick them out into the cold, that should help waken them up.""



""But Marjorie, if we keep them out for so long-""



""I didn't say all day, a few hours should be just fine. Better than wasting all your energy on them. You need to be more creative, dear brother.""



""That's why I have you, sister."" Cackling at their sick joke, Petunia made haste to push the twins out of the backyard and lock the door. Ripper sat in front of the door, staring at them with a snarl, he was to keep watch in case they tried to sneak back in or run away- not that they had the energy nor the courage to do so. 



Huddling by the corner garden fence, they tried to ignore the sharp cold winds. Harry began sobbing and apologizing to Rose, but she smiled trying to console her brother. Their growling stomachs weren't helping.



""Here...""



""A cookie?""



""... Dudley dropped it, he took a bite but didn't like it. Oatmeal raisin.""



""L-let's share it-""



""It's not enough. Eat it.""



""No. One bite each.""



""But-""



""Half."" Afraid of Petunia coming back and seeing the cookie in her hand, Rose reluctantly agreed and took a small bite of the cookie, giving the rest to Harry. Not happy with the amount she ate, Harry inhaled the rest when he heard Petunia's voice grow louder as she was walking towards the door to check on them. 



Muttering behind the glass, her face scrunched up in displeasure staring at the shivering twins whilst Marjorie walked behind her muttering in response to Petunia's distress. Walking away, they swallowed the cookie.  



To add to their misery, snow had begun to fall. 



""...merry Christmas, Harry.""



""Merry Christmas, Rose..."" 


 

Shivers ran down their spines as they mentally swatted away their horrid Christmas past. It wasn't all that different from their usual days but the holidays seemed worse with Aunt Marjorie around. She always got a kick out of seeing the twins so miserable, whenever she came around she would come up with new and 'creative' punishments for her Vernon and Petunia to use. Thinking about their past Christmas experiences, much like anything from their past with the Dursleys, it was nothing but pain and misery.

""No.""

""No?"" Not understanding the answer, Sirius and Remus glanced at one another, confused. 

""Don't need anything."" Harry smiled. 

""Mmh. Nothing."" Rose agreed.

""I'm sure you have something you'd like to do, pups. Anything at all, just name it. You needn't worry about the price of it or how simple it is."" Sirius tried to encourage the twins, but they refused and smiled.

""--We're okay."" Sirius softly sighed, he knew what that smile and voice meant. They were anything but okay. Opening his mind to try and have the twins rethink, Remus was quick to cut in. 

""There's no rush, Harry. Rose. We still have a few weeks left, will you at least think about it?"" 

Not likely to change their minds, they still nodded at Sirius' words. Hopeful, he stroked their heads and grinned. ""It'll be our very first Christmas together."" 

 

~~

~~

 

Weeks have passed and Christmas was about a week away but much to Sirius and Remus's anticipation, the twins haven't said a word concerning Christmas since they asked all those weeks ago. They tried to hint a few times about a wishlist from the twins but it was the same few answers; we're fine, we don't need anything, we don't need anything else, and the all famous nothing. 

Sirius was wallowing in misery as he laid his head on the mahogany desk muttering how much of a failure he is as their godfather. Remus resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he pondered on what to do about their first Christmas. 

""Perhaps we should ask.""

""Ask...?""

""We do know quite a few people who have children, Sirius.""

""... Do we have to?""

""Do you want Harry and Rose to wake up that day with; oh merry Christmas you two. Would you like some Christmas pudding and have fun in the snow? Just that? Great."" 

""...Narcissa.""

""I'll get the mirror.""

""That's for emergencies-""

""I'd say this is quite the emergency."" Grabbing the mirror from the cabinet, Remus waited for Narcissa to reply, luckily she was quick to pick up. 

""Remus, what a lovely surprise. Didn't Sirius specifically tell me this was meant for emergencies?""

""This is one of those times."" Chuckling, she and Remus exchanged a few pleasantries until Sirius cut in, 

""CHRISTMAS EMERGENCY!!""

""Pardon?"" Used to Sirius's sudden cut-ins and panic screeches, she calmly asked what he was talking about and Remus repeated.

""We're having a small-""

""Small?!"" Pushing Sirius away, he sighed. 

""It's Harry and Rose, we wanted to do this grand Christmas day so we asked what they'd want or like to do but they said they don't want anything and our imagination to make up for it is a little short...""

Sadly smiling, Narcissa sighed, ""Did you boys really think they'd tell you what they'd like? Old habits are hard to fix.""

""We knew that, it's just we had hoped they'd say well... just anything. We thought things were getting better.""

""Scars aren't easy to heal, Remus. You both know that."" 

Silent, the two glanced at one another as another heavy sigh escaped their mouths. This was difficult...

""I do have an idea though. I was hoping to ask you on Christmas eve, but perhaps this is better.""

""I'm sorry we are relying on you so much, Narcissa. We aren't doing well as guardians.""

""Nonsense, you are doing just fine. Just practice is all you need and who better to ask than me?""

""That's high praise, Narcissa."" Sirius sarcastically remarked as she chuckled. 

""I'm a mother, I'm allowed.""

""So, what did you have in mind?"" 

 

~~

~~

 

Gentle rocking and a whisper stirred Harry awake as he opened one eye to see who was calling him. Rubbing his eyes, he made out a blurry figure hovering over him. Blinking a few times he smiled, ""Morning Rose.""

""Harry, it's snowing outside."" Pointing to the window, Harry looked up towards the window.

""Woah..."" Watching the snow, the two couldn't help but smile that for once they weren't outside freezing. ""Oh-! Happy Christmas Rose."" 

""Happy Christmas."" Smiling at one another, they hadn't realized Sirius and Remus were right behind them. 

""Good morning my pups!"" Startled, they looked up to see Sirius grinning down at them. Beaming, they bid him and Remus good morning and a merry Christmas. Sirius peppered the twins with kisses making them giggle from his scratchy beard whilst Remus smiled and flicked his wand to the bath faucet. 

""It is Christmas! Shall we get you both washed up and head on out?""

""Out?"" Were they going somewhere? Sirius nor Remus had told them anything about going out. 

""Why of course. We've been invited!"" Not following Sirius's words, they nodded nonetheless. Getting washed up and putting on their usual clothing, the two men waited for them downstairs. 

""All ready?"" Holding out his hand, they each took the offered hand from both men and followed them.

""Where are we going, Padfoot?""

Grinning, he told them to close their eyes and hold on tight. Remus picked up Rose and went through the fireplace first as Harry was still confused about what was happening. Sirius held Harry by his hip and asked if he was ready to which he only nodded. Walking through, Harry heard muffled voices and Sirius gently guiding him somewhere. 


'Rose?'



'I'm here. Where are we?'



'I don't know. Padfoot says to wait a bit...'



'Oh? is that Draco-?'


""Pups, you can open your eyes now.""

Opening their eyes, a small glow floats in front of them for a moment before whisking away and lighting every light source around them as a sudden rainfall of confetti and stars rain around them. 

""Merry Christmas Harry! Rose!!"" 

The room lit up and the twins saw they were in the Malfoy Manor. Decorated with garlands, balls of lights floating around, ornaments and evergreen everywhere you looked. Familiar faces stood in front of them as they all smiled and welcomed the twins.

""Merry Christmas... but..."" Looking up to Sirius for context, he smiled. 

""I know you said you and Rose didn't want anything for Christmas but Remus and I wanted you to have the best first Christmas. All of us together as a family. Was this alright?""

""Y-Yes... T-Thank you Padfoot. Moony.""

""As Sirius said, we're all family now, Harry."" Narcissa smiled, stroking the boy's head, Harry shyly smiled and nodded. 

""Do you like it, sweetheart?"" Lilith asked and Rose could only nod. They hadn't expected such a huge celebration, not that they could even imagine It. They did want Sirius and Remus to do anything more, they were already so lucky to have such loving and caring guardians. Hearing everyone wish them a merry Christmas and that they had prepared gifts for them, overwhelmed them. They just felt so... loved. 

""Rose?! What's wrong, do you not like it?"" Sirius asked in a panic. Rose shook her head as she tried to wipe the never-ending stream of tears, she apologized. 

""What's the matter, love?"" Remus asked. 

""... We don't deserve this."" Harry held Rose's hand as he was on the verge of crying as well. 

""Of course you do. You most likely deserve it more than anyone."" Wiping away her tears, Lilith smiled. ""We all wanted to make sure you both had a memorable Christmas and of course, we aren't going to stop there."" 

""She's right, we'll make sure to smother you with so much love that you'll get sick of us."" Narcissa smiled making Lucius laugh. 

""Yeah! We'll celebrate every holiday and birthday with you every year!"" Pansy hugged Rose and began wailing with Rose making Amaryllis and Percival chuckle. 

""First of many. We'll be all together every year."" 

""All of us?"" Smiling at Harry's hopeful voice, he stroked the top of his head and nodded.

""Always."" 

That's all they wanted. Just to be all together as a family. 

This is the first of many. 

""Happy Christmas-!"" "

As it was, he probably wouldn't have heard them if he hadn't been waiting for them in the first place.  He lay on his back, staring at the bed's canopy, waiting. 

Soon enough, the curtains around his bed were drawn.  The figure who had pulled them said nothing, standing motionless in the near darkness.  It wasn't until Sirius muttered a sleepy, ""Well, come on then"", that Remus moved again, crawling into bed and quickly closing the curtains.

The two boys lay side by side, saying nothing.  Remus' old, scraggly jumper itched Sirius' bare arm as he fidgeted into a more comfortable position. 

They'd been sharing a bed on and off since last month's moon.  They'd shared before, of course, over vacations at the Potter's or when they'd stayed up too late talking and fallen asleep in whoever's bed they'd been perched on.  It was normally a matter of convenience, not comfort.  But the last moon had been particularly rough. He'd woken when he heard Remus stumble into the dorm, making noise in the way only someone failing at being quiet can.  Madame Pomfrey had done what she could to heal his wounds, but red irritated skin and bruises remained on his face and arms.  It hadn't been his injuries that worried Sirius, though, but his face.  Remus looked crumpled and worn.  There was a hopelessness in his eyes and in the set of his mouth as he and Sirius stared at one another across the dorm. 

Sirius had squinted and roughly whispered, ""Do you want to come over here?"" 

Remus had tilted his head.

""What?""

""Do you want to...?""  Sirius had gestured at his bedside with one hand, rubbing his eyes with the other.  Remus had limped away from his bed to the other's, and sat down.

""Do you need something?""

""No, course not, just thought you might want to hang out.  I could get out my board, or the map?""

Remus had shaken his head, wincing. 

""I think I ought to sleep, instead.  Thanks.""

Sirius caught his arm as he went to stand.

""You could, ah, sleep here? If you wanted?"" 

That had seemed to startle Remus, who laughed, sitting back down.  Sirius had tried to explain,

""Not that you need a bed buddy, or anything.  Just- it can be nice to sleep next to someone, you know, when things aren't great?""

Remus had laughed again and given Sirius a strange look.  But he had laid down, muttering ""Budge up, will you."" when Sirius was too slow to move his sprawled limbs.  They had fallen asleep, and Remus had left the bed in the morning before the other gryfs could see them and make it a joke. 

Sirius himself almost forgot about the encounter, until Remus had shown up at his bedside a few days later.  He had stood there awkwardly for a good few minutes until Sirius had given him a quiet, ""...Yes?""

""Is it alright if I just, go ahead and...""  This time, Remus was the one gesturing weakly. 

Sirius had laughed and turned on his side, waving a hand behind him. ""Yeah, whatever you want Moony.  Don't interrupt my beauty sleep.""  

Remus had quietly slid next to him.

Those two nights became four, then eight, and then it seemed that Remus was pulling aside Sirius' curtains nearly every night.  Sirius wouldn't have minded, really, if they had talked about it.  But Remus woke up before Sirius and moved to his own bed every morning, and had brushed off any attempts Sirius made at talking about it with a ""What?"" or a ""Leave it alone, Padfoot.""  It was driving Sirius mad.

That was why he had made sure to stay awake, waiting for Remus.  He was determined to have him at least acknowledge what they were doing.

So, as Remus fidgeted, Sirius drew his wand and cast a silencing charm on the bed's curtains.  Instantly, Remus looked at him, wary.

""What was that for?""

""We need to talk."" 

Remus flinched away. ""We really don't.""

""Yes, we really do, if we're going to keep doing this.""

""This?  We're just sleeping.  If you're going to be weird I'll just go back to my bed.""

Sirius snorted.  ""I'm not being weird, you're being weird!  You won't talk to me about this, you've gotten all distant during the day...the only time I see you one on one anymore is at night, and then you won't even talk to me!"" 

Remus shrunk away as Sirius grew louder. ""I've just been tired.""

""I don't doubt it, since you've been waking up however early to get away from me.""

At that Remus heaved a sigh, and sat up.  ""I don't want to get away from you, Sirius.""

Sirius sat up as well and turned his head. ""Well, you've been doing fuck all to show that.""

Remus was silent for a minute.  Sirius began to fidget impatiently until the other boy took a deep breath and began.

""Things have just been so...different lately.  James is always trying to spend more time with Evans, and Peter just wants to lackey around with him.  The moons have been getting worse, and we have exams coming up, and I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life and I'm just. I'm tired.""

Remus ended abruptly, looking down at his lap.  Sirius nudged his shoulder with his own.

""Look, mate, I get it.  You have a whole lot going on, we all do, and if what it takes to deal with that is sharing a bed with me, okay. Fine. Tip top!  I just wanted you to talk to me.""

Remus butted Sirius' shoulder back and smiled at him. Sirius beamed back.

""So, that's all, Moony?""

At this, Remus bit his lip.  He took a long breath, and sighed through his nose. 

""Do you want me to be honest, Pads?""

Sirius didn't hesitate.

""Of course!""

Remus tilted his head back against the wall and shut his eyes.

""I don't want to hurt our friendship.""

""It'd take a fair bit more to break us apart than a moonlight confession, Moony.  As I recall, we've already had a rather drastic one of those.""

Remus gave a half-hearted laugh.  Then, with a tight expression, he breathed out,

""I think I'm kind of...into you.""

Sirius stilled, tensing. Remus' head shot up, and he began scrambling to wretch the curtains apart. ""Nevermind, I'm going to go-""

It was Sirius' vice-like grip on his arm that stopped him.

 ""No, Remus, just give me a moment. Please."" 

Remus stopped and sat stock still next to Sirius.  After a few beats, Sirius asked, ""Really?""

""No, I just love humiliating myself and the sting of rejection.  Of course really.""

Sirius let out a breath. ""Well.""

""Well.""

""Kiss me.""

Remus' shoulders shot up. ""Excuse me?""

""I'll be honest, Moony, I don't, I haven't...I've had my fair share of experiences with the fairer sex but I've never...with blokes, and I haven't really thought of you like that, but I'd be willing, maybe?""

Sirius ended lamely, looking at Remus, whose face twisted.

""I don't want to be something tested on or tried.  Why don't we just forget the whole thing.""

Sirius ran his fingers through his hair. 

""No, but, Remus. I.""  He sighed and started again.

""I've missed you so much the last few weeks.  It's been like, this part of me just faded away, and you were still here.  I like having you in my bed, and seeing you, and all I want to do is make you smile, and- I sound like an idiot.  All I'm trying to say is that I always thought we were just best friends.  But you and I are different than me and James, or you and James, and I never really questioned why but now that I'm thinking about it I think that maybe you should. You know.  Kiss me.  And we can see.""

Remus ran a hand over his face, then pinched the bridge of his nose.  He looked at Sirius' face through his lashes.  Sirius, for his part, looked earnest.  

""Fine.""

Sirius brightened, then tensed.

""So, how you want to go about this?""

Remus muttered something that sounded like ""I thought you were supposed to be the experienced one."" Before turning to face the other.  He placed his hands on his shoulders and leaned in.

The kiss should've been unremarkable to Sirius.  He'd kissed enough people to know.  Remus' lips were thin, and he kept them still against Sirius'.  But the knowledge that this was Remus he was kissing made him feel lightheaded. Sirius deepened the kiss, and Remus finally responded, hesitantly moving his mouth with Sirius'.  After a moment, they pulled apart. 

""So?"" Remus asked, quietly.

Sirius smiled, leaning his forehead against the other's.

""I think...I may be a little into you, too."""

Draco looked back at the coffin behind him. He didn't want to do this but he had made a promise. He had promised to tell the story of Harry Potter and all the thoughts and feelings he had had about the world. Why did he even promise that? What a stupid promise. However, it had made Harry happy and he had dedicated his life to making Harry happy, especially since finding out about the disease.

""Harry Potter didn't marry Ginny. He didn't marry her, because he didn't love her. Or maybe he did, but like a sister not like you're supposed to love the person you marry. He didn't have kids with her. And you all despise him for it. Don't deny it we all know it is true. Nevertheless, Harry Potter didn't do it because he didn't want to bring kids to the world if they could not have two happy parents who loved them with all they had. Harry Potter didn't go out to find another girlfriend because Harry Potter was gay.""

Loud gasps could be heard among the funeral guests. Even a few exclamations of he must be lying. Draco did not care. Those who mattered knew he spoke the truth. He looked down to the front row seeing Hermione, tears streaming down her face trying to calm a furious Ron and stopping him from coming up on stage to hit Draco. 

""Harry Potter didn't go work as an auror right after the war. He chose to go back to Hogwarts to take his NEWT's. Not because, as you think, he wanted to earn his place amongst the aurors. He didn't even join the aurors afterward because he was tired of fighting. He was tired of everybody counting on him to catch the bad guys. He went back to Hogwarts because he didn't know what to do and because he needed time to think. He went back to school to spend time with his boyfriend."" 

Even more loud gasps and a few yells. Draco looked back at the coffin a sad smile on his lisp as he whispered ""They don't believe me, love"" He turned back to look at the guests. 

""I speak the truth, you might not believe me. But I promised to tell this story to you all. This story doesn't have a happy ending. Harry Potter is dead. He died of cancer, a sickness not even magic can cure. I watched him die. I sat with him 'till the very end. I laughed with him and I cried with him. I held his hand and gave him comfort. I promised to tell his story so you would all know that he despised being used as a weapon in a war he never even wanted to fight. He despised how you all depended on him instead of taking care of the problems yourself. He despised how he was left with the Dursleys and no one checked to see how he was. How he was made to go back there every summer even after telling people about the abuse he suffered at their hands."" 

Draco took a deep breath and let it out slowly. He had practiced his speech many times, but it still pained him to think of Harrys lost childhood and the fact that no one cared to check up on the boy they expected to save them all. He felt so blessed to be given a second chance to get to know Harry. 

""I stand before you because I promised Harry and because I want you to know that you let him down time and time again throughout his life. He gave me a chance to get to know him. He gave me the chance to see how wonderful he was and to love him. And by some miracle he loved me back. I know you won't believe this but I was the boyfriend of the great Harry Potter and I will love him forever."" 

Draco took a step back and knelt down in front of the casket holding his boyfriend. ""I'm sorry love. I can't go on without you."" That was his last words before he took his wand and the funeral guests saw the green light of the Avada Kedavra curse."
12186753,in the palm of her hand,['Miraphina Atherton (mew_tsubaki)'],General Audiences,Gen,Harry Potter - J. K. Rowling,,Lucy Weasley,"Angst, Lucy-centric - Freeform",English,2017-09-25,Completed,2017-09-25,2175,1/1,null,7,null,90,['WizardWriter123'],[],"The world is an open box that will someday close on her, and she wouldn't mind it at all.

It's not a note of sadness or depression. Lucy Weasley has always seen it as a box, from the day when her little collection started.

She would call them trinkets, because not one is alike. Though they're mainly small, not one has ceased to delight her. Well, ""delight"" may not be the best word choice, but Lucy's never felt the need to explain her...hobby before.

When she and Molly were little, their parents took them to a Muggle carnival, at the insistence of their mother, Audrey. The electrical contraptions were fun and all, but the little booths caught Lucy's eye. Easy games and not-so-easy games, each bursting to the seams with prizes waiting to be won.

One booth had the prettiest little handcrafted boxes--""pillboxes, or the like,"" Audrey had said--but that ended up being the only thing Lucy wanted. Out of the whole trip, Lucy just wanted that prize.

Audrey loved her baby girl and therefore tried the beanbag toss. However, the rings seemed too small to possibly allow a beanbag through. She turned to Lucy, saying, ""Sorry, luv, maybe--""

But then Percy, Lucy and Molly's father, had stepped up to the booth wordlessly and slapped down the Muggle five quid. The booth operator presented Percy with three beanbags, and Percy picked one up, staring at it for a moment with a look on his face that said he didn't really like doing things below him. Nevertheless, he tossed the bag--and it went in on the first shot.

On a whim, he threw the other two, both of which missed. But those shots didn't matter. Percy had gotten one in, and now Lucy had her pick of prizes. Automatically she reached for the silver box, only to discover it had something in it.

""Earrings,"" her older sister remarked. ""Flowers, gems, and owls.""

Lucy could care less what they were. She lifted out the cardboard insert and passed it to her sister, who had pierced ears. Then Lucy closed the box again, marveling at the roundness of the container and how perfectly the lid fit with the body. The lid she loved the most, for the center was a clear sheet of plastic through which she could see the silver inside of the whole container.

And that was how it started.

Birthdays, holidays, any time Lucy got a gift, she always told her family that the packaging mattered, not what was inside. Percy and Audrey would elaborate and inform the others that Lucy liked the trinket boxes best, so Lucy became the fun Weasley child to buy for, because her aunts, uncles, cousins, and parents were always on the hunt for a unique container that would bring her the most joy. It became a sort of contest.

When Lucy got her Hogwarts letter, her family left to shop in Diagon Alley, and her four-years-older sister took her to buy her ink and quills while their parents got their books. ""You'll want something to hold your quill shavings,"" Molly explained. ""Dragging your quill across the page wears it down, and unfortunately you can't cast a spell on a quill that's been enchanted to hold a lot of ink for about one or two essays-worth. That's layering spells, which can be wonky.""

Of course, then the shopkeeper had found them and corrected Molly, showing them the latest quill that would stay sharp and hold about half a bottle of ink. Lucy wandered back to the shavings boxes, tuning out her sister's bickering with the owner and focusing instead on a lone, square box which she removed from the shelf. It was exactly square--the perfect cube--with a metal latch on the front to keep the lid closed. The outside was wrapped in a spot of green Chinese silk, with gold dragons weaved into the fabric; the dragons moved when she opened the box, to peer at the red lining.

Sharp quills or not, Lucy knew she had to have this shavings box. Molly didn't argue with her, though she was slightly annoyed, knowing that her sister wouldn't use it for its intended purpose. No, it would go into Lucy's collection.

Needless to say, Molly won that year.

For her birthday during her second year, Audrey won with a wooden box the same size as the shavings box, the size of the palm of Lucy's hand. It was made from mahogany and matched the rich color of Audrey's hair. The lid was carved with a Celtic Tri-Goddess design, and the sides were etched with the letters of Lucy's name, the bottom possessing a curly ""W"" for her surname. Lucy turned this box around for hours, watching the cursive letters dance and spell out her name, kind of like a friend calling out to her. For her, it was a friend's beckoning, because her boxes never asked much of her, just that she keep them dust-free--and never open them.

Yes, pretty box after pretty box, Lucy opened them once to look at the inside--silver, red silk, mahogany, crystal, mirror-glass, plastic, threadbare--and then closed it, never to open them again. No one in her family understood that, and so the contest became a competition. Whose present would Lucy love completely, inside and out? But they didn't understand that it would be a never-ending competition, for Lucy treated the boxes all the same.

Third year, Christmas--the hexagonal gem box, crystal inlay: won by Aunt Ginny and Uncle Harry.

Fourth year, Easter--the kaleidoscope ring box, mirror inlay: won by Aunt Fleur and Uncle Bill.

Fifth year, for acing her O.W.L.s--the unicorn-head box, creamy white plastic inlay: won by Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione.

Middle of sixth year, her seventeenth birthday--the toffee box, with a threadbare inlay that showed pictures of foreign continents: won by Uncle George and Aunt Angelina.

Oh, she knew what the insides looked like. She knew them like the back of her hand. ...she knew them like her own beating heart. How could she not? They were her treasures...and the proverbial skeletons in her closet.

Every time she opened a box, she left something in it. No, nothing tangible, just a little fleeting piece of her, because not all her occasions had been the best of celebrations.

The gem box possessed her smile. It took it when her cousins, Roxanne and Lily, vowed never to speak to her again, as she had accidentally blabbed that both of them were in love with Teddy Lupin. Sure, things hadn't been right between those two since Lucy opened her mouth, but they found common ground in despising Lucy. So she showed the crystal inside her pretty grin one last time--and then, click, it was never seen again.

The ring box possessed her beauty. Or, according to Lucy, what little of it she might've had. Because when Aunt Fleur and Uncle Bill gave her that box, she hadn't felt any plainer next to it than she had before. But that before was next to someone, not something. It hadn't helped that Victoire had once compared the two of them in a moment of testiness, and that Roxanne had snatched up Lorcan Scamander first, the boy whom Lucy had come to secretly love. No, Lucy might not have felt ""beautiful,"" but whatever prettiness she had was in that ring box.

The unicorn-head box possessed her sense. No longer could she make a move without screwing anything up. Whether it be telling Uncle Ron about Rose and Scorpius Malfoy, or telling Uncle Ron about Aunt Hermione and--no. She'd stop there. Often Lucy thought the unicorn held her hurt inside its tiny space, as well.

The toffee box held her humor. Not only had Uncle George and Aunt Angelina given it on her seventeenth birthday as a gift to welcome her to the adult Wizarding world, but it was a sort of pre-gift for her getting her Apparition license. Uncle George regaled her with tales of his and his twin's past and how they used to scare Grandmam Weasley whenever they popped into a room, but both he and Aunt Angelina knew Lucy liked the pictures on the inside. There was a point to the thread-pictures of other continents. It had been known for years that Lucy wanted to be a kind of magical ambassador, traveling to other places to learn new kinds of magic. But surely Cousin Freddie and Cousin Al hadn't meant for a ""fun journey"" to turn out to be a trip to James' apartment, where she discovered her third-eldest cousin in a relationship...with his male former Muggle Studies teacher. Professor Finch-Fletchley didn't even have time to recognize her before James stomped after her, chasing her from his home. Oh, yes, Al and Freddie, what a funny joke you played on her. Perhaps her humor had to disappear since she'd long ago lost her smile...?

But it's the older gifts, the beginnings of her collection which hold things most volatile. Molly's shavings box held her sadness. Lucy knew she'd never be like her sister, smart, pretty, charming, stern yet pleasant. For all their cousins complained about Molly's nagging, she was definitely one of them. Lucy, on the other hand, was not so sure of herself, and only after the shavings box would she build up years' worth of evidence to back the fact. But that box held her sadness and tears, and good thing for that, too...

The unicorn head she liked the least, actually. She liked it on Uncle Ron's behalf and hated it on Aunt Hermione's behalf. So because she hated it in reality, she probably loved her mother's mahogany container the most. It held her happiness, and how could it not? She loved her mother dearly, because--when push came to shove--she knew that her mother would always be the one to love her. Godric knew that that love had been tested.

The mahogany box was like a bad omen. For it was in that same second year of school when Lucy received it that Lucy had discovered her perfect little family wasn't as perfect as she thought. Her home was what she'd always imagined her future life to be--the dad, the mum, the kids...a nice two-story house, with a marble fireplace to Floo...a large front yard with an even bigger backyard specifically made for practicing flying...they had it all.

Or so she thought.

For it was not that long after the mahogany box when Lucy was home on break and saw what she couldn't believe: Percy and Hermione, kissing the ways mums and dads do, not the way siblings-in-law should. No, Percy and Hermione never saw her, but Lucy sent her mother into a panic when Lucy holed herself up in her room. For the rest of the break, Lucy spoke to no one, and, back at school, Lucy did everything she could not to speak to her family. Of course, this was before Roxanne and Lily stopped speaking to her, so her cousins and roommates fretted over her not saying a word. Eventually they gave up.

At the end of second year, Lucy knew she had to go home, and things were tense. Little did she know that Audrey had found out, and she and Percy were trying to work through things. But Audrey could feel the pain coursing through her younger daughter, so when she entered Lucy's room with a knowing look in her eyes, the dam broke, and Lucy cried and cried and cried in her mother's arms, while Audrey patted her daughter's auburn hair and shh'd her.

Perhaps it had been an even worse omen that in the first box, won by Percy himself, Lucy had locked away her love.

It probably had been the worst choice, but when Lucy got the little silver box with its clear lid, all the size of the circle her thumb and index finger made when put together, the first thing she felt compelled to do was place her heart in it. It weren't as though she'd completely locked it away, as she had done with the other bits and pieces of her over the later years and the other boxes. No, with this container she could still view her heart, a memory of what it'd once been like to be human, whole...perfect.... Innocent.

So she doesn't open her boxes more than once, but it's not a sad thing. She's able to view all that once made her Lucy. They're nice memories of times before certain things went wrong. If she opens them, everything will fly out of her control. When she closes them, she feels as though she has power over something. And that motivates her to keep adding to her collection, because she won't ever run out of the broken pieces of herself to hide away...

...never to be seen again."

	Falling in love with your straight best friend is almost always a bad idea. When it's not it's a romantic comedy, when it is you ache inside. Castiel had learned to live through the ache, it still bothered him but it was just a small ache. It only happened when Dean did something so utterly Dean.

	Like for instance, when he looked up from his copy of the Complete Works of Robert Frost that they had been studying for their Senior English class with a full-hearted smile on his face. A smile that was normally only reserved for Dean's little brother Sam or his mother Mary.  

	""Whatcha thinkin' bout Cas?"" he asked closing his book and letting it dangle between his parted jean clad legs.

	Castiel had also learned at this point that the best way to deter Dean from him, was to bring up a girl. Although he hated it when Dean spoke brazenly about his conquests it was better than silence or Castiel speaking about himself. Castiel loved to listen to Dean talk, it didn't even matter what the topic was it was one of Castiels favorite things about Dean. The way he spoke and told stories.

	So Castiel spoke ""The social impact of not attending Senior Prom, not because I do not have a date but simply because it is not the right date."" he said pulling his notebook from the floor and proping it between his legs along with his book.

	""So I take it the demon bitch Meg asked you?"" Dean questioned looking over to Castiel.

	""Yes, though I told her that I would ""think about it""."" 

	At this Dean stood and made his way across the room to his record player, turning his back to Castiel as he pulled off the record that had stopped emitting music.

	""And what makes Meg the wrong date, I mean aside from the whole bitch thing?"" he asked shuffling through his crate of records and glancing over his shoulder to look at Castiel.

	""She's a She."" Castiel answered without thinking. Fuck, he though as he watched Dean fumble with the record that he had been holding and it slipping out of his and hand and faintly smacking the floor. 

	Dean turned then ignoring the fallen record. ""She's a She."" he repeated looking back across the room to where Castiel was. Castiel quickly stood and made for the door. He was horrorstuck, after ten years of friendship he had just blurted out one of the only things that Dean did not currently know about him.

	 He grabbed his trench coat from Dean's bed and was halfway out of the room before something caught his wrist. A hand, Dean's hand his brain registered and then he was being pulled back into the room and pressed back up against the now closed door. 

	He closed his eyes not knowing what was coming next. ""She's a she, Cas?"" Dean said questioning. ""Yes."" Castiel quietly answered. 

	""Cas..man..open your eyes."" Dean said moving his hand from the wall where he had pinned Castiel to the shoulder that was near his hand. Castiel's eyes fluttered open and were met by Dean's own shinning green orbs. 

	""What did you mean by that Cas?"" Dean asked shifting his weight from one foot to the other. 

	Castiel's thoughts fought amongst each other, clouding his brain, should he lie or just give in and hope for the best?

	He tilted his head to the side exhaling softly. ""I meant what it sounded like Dean. I'mnotinterestedingirls"" he managed to get out quickly before his mouth was being covered by another.

	Surprise shot through him and he tensed in response. Dean quickly pulled away. ""Cas..Cas..Cas."" Dean muttered looking down and then back up and meeting Castiel's eyes his cheeks covered in a pink blush. 

	That was when it registered with Castiel that Dean had just kissed him and that he had not just imagined it. Placing his hand on Dean's chest he pushed lightly getting Dean's attention.

	""You kissed me"" he stated dumbfounded.

	""Yes"" Dean responded.

	""Why?"" Castiel asked.

	Dean moved his hand from where it was on Castiel's shoulder to cup Castiel's face, running his thumb along Castiel's stubbled jaw.

	""Beacuse...i ..ugh wanted to to, that's why."" he said quickly before moving in again and capturing Castiel's lips. 

	This time however, Castiel managed to respond. As Dean ran his tongue lightly across the seam of his lips he clutched at Dean's chest parting his lips in response.

	So maybe Castiel was wrong all along. Falling for your best-friend was always like a romantic comedy, he thought as he turned the key in the door locking the house and turning to the street. Dean was there leaning against his baby with one of those smile's on his face and clutching a boutonniere in his hand.

	""So hows about we get to this dance, angel?""

	Yes. Perhaps he was very wrong."

The air was warm and thick like a hug. The sun beating down on the grass, not a cloud in sight. The weather was mocking the occasion. How could it be so beautiful on the day her friends were being buried? Ginny sat in a chair in between Charlie and George. McGonagall was giving a heartfelt eulogy for every one lost in the battle.  The pitch was filled with weeping students and families. Dennis Creevey and his parents were a few rows back. Torrence Kilder, Ginny's potions partner since first year, her mother was sobbing held by Torrence's father. Andromeda sat cradling an orphan Teddy. She promised herself she wouldn't cry, she wouldn't falter at the names of her fallen friends and family. She had to be strong, Mum needs her to be strong, Dad needs her, and George.

She glanced over at him. His head was slunk down staring at the grass. He didn't want to come today, especially since Fred wasn't being buried until Friday. She placed her hand on his knee, a sign of subtle comfort. He just rested his head on her shoulder. They were all tired, the past few days had taken everything out of them. She glanced at Bill and Fleur, who was sitting next to Mum and Dad, Bill looked stoically at McGonagall. His scars distracting from his watery eyes. Fleur had no shame her sadness, she let the tears fall gracefully down her cheek. She looked down at her hand, shaking still. It hadn't stopped for weeks. She glanced behind her, at the far back of the pitch was Hermione, Ron, and Harry. They were shielding him from the crowd. They've been shielding him from the world recently. He was hiding in Grimmauld's Place, sulking Ginny's presumes. Ron and Hermione said he didn't want anyone to see him. She didn't plead or beg, she knew better than to push him. She couldn't do anything about it, he didn't want to be around, despite everything they've been through.
McGonagall concluded her speech and gestured for us all to enter the castle. She slowly stood up waiting for her family to file out of the aisles. Ron and Hermione met them, hands enveloped. ""He must have left,"" she thought. They all walked together mostly in silence, except for the bickering between Mum and Ron.

	""He shouldn't be alone, he should be with family,"" shouted Mum in a hushed voice.

	""He doesn't want to. Me and 'Mione are trying but he's stuck in his own head,"" argued Ron.

	""Well you can start by letting her see him, I'm sure she'd be able to put him right,"" 

	""He doesn't want to see her the most, Mum,"" Ginny stopped listening. His words stung more than she wanted them to. 

It wasn't her responsibility to fix him anyway. She had bigger things troubling her besides 'the boy who left her'. As they entered the Castle, they were led down to a corridor. A Hall of Heroes was be created filled with portraits of the fallen. There were unique plaques under every painting, most of which Ginny had written. McGonagall had asked her since she knew most of them. She saw Luna standing with Dean, Seamus, and Neville. She went up to them and gave them each a tight hug.

	""How've you been?"" asked Dean. She couldn't be honest.

	""I've been holding on,"" she said. 

They walked down the corridor together, people were stopping at portraits, speaking to their friends and family. Ginny didn't stop though, she didn't think it was healthy. She didn't want to hold on to the memory of all that she's lost. She just wanted to let go of everything. She was walking by herself, everyone else had drifted off. She spotted George standing in front of Fred's portrait. She was conflicted about comforting one brother and facing the other. Her mind said ""He needs you, He needs to know it'll be okay"" but her heart is telling her ""You'll just get hurt, it not real,"". She decided his needs outweigh hers, right now family comes first. She walks up to him and just stands there.

	""It's not the same, It's not actually him,"" whispered George. Ginny looked up at him, there were no tears. That's not what she really noticed, there was not a glimpse of joy in his eyes. No matter what sadness they'd felt in their lives, George still carried on with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eyes. It was gone, there was nothing to smile about, the worst had happened. He'd lost his half.

	""He's really gone, isn't he?"" said George.

	""It doesn't hurt because he's gone, it hurts because he can never truly leave us,"" It's something Luna had told her, she thought it was wise.

	""I'm suffering, Gin,"" he said resting his head on her shoulder.

	""Me too, Georgie,""

This is a kind of revision of another fic I wrote from harry's pov. It's set on the day of Fred's funeral.

May 15th, 1998

It was Friday, Ginny'd been awake since dawn. A lot had to be done and she didn't want Mum doing the brunt of the work. It was going to be a hard day without having to deal with all the guests too. She dawned a black, short sleeve dress and pulled her hair half up. She was making breakfast for the family, as she and Mum had been cooking for most of the night. Bill and Fleur came down first, 

	""Thanks, Gin,"" said Bill. Fleur was setting the table, Ginny almost corrected her when she put down 10 instead of 11 plates. Charlie and Percy came down next taking the seats opposite Bill. They were talking about who all was coming.

	""Lee's supposed the be round a bit before but he can't stay long,"" said Charlie.

	""Mum says Angelina's gonna come, that might be good for George,"" said Bill. She'd hadn't heard his floor creak all morning. She wasn't sure if he was awake or not. 

	""Vhat about 'Arry?"" asked Fleur. Ginny could feel their looks.

	""We'll have to ask Ron,"" said Bill, ending the conversation.

Everyone else had come down, except George. She was starting to get worried and she didn't like worrying. Mum was starting to get nervous too, she kept glancing up the stairs. 

	""I'll bring him a tray, Mum,"" She said trying to alleviate both of their stress.

	""Oh... Thank you, Gin"" Ginny assembled a tray of toast, eggs, and sausages. She walked up the flights of stairs and knocked on the door.

	""George, I have breakfast for you,"" she didn't hear a response and went to knock again, but then the door swung open. George was wearing a new black suit and tying his tie.

	""Can you set it on the bed?"" he said quietly. He looked tired. His eyes were red and his bags deep. She walked over to his bed and set the tray down. She turned back and gently set her hand over his shoulder. 

	""Do you know who all's gonna be here?"" he asked.

	""I know Lee, Angelina, Neville, Dean, and Luna,"" she said.

	""Mind if I hang around you today? You're the only one that's not totally depressing,"" she smiled at him. 

	""Don't mind at all,"" she closed the door behind her and started walking down the steps.

	""We told him it was today, but I don't know if he'll show,"" it was Ron's voice. Ginny instantly knew who they were talking about. 

	""He has to Ron, he couldn't just miss this,"" it was Hermione. 

	""He's been through a lot 'Mione, it'll be fine"" 

	""No, we can't just let him off the hook anymore, he has to show,"" It sounded like Hermione was just as fed up with Harry as Ginny was. Deep down she wanted him to show, she wanted him to show that he still cared. She wouldn't get her hopes up, she wouldn't allow herself to get let down again. 

 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most people had left, George had returned to his room. No one tried to get him to stay. At this point in the day, everyone wanted to just crawl up in bed. They all just sat in the living room, listening to the radio. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Ginny sat there absentmindedly petting Crookshanks. She looked down at her hand, the shaking had gotten better but it didn't stop. She didn't want to go to bed yet, she hadn't been able to sleep the same for months. Ginny glanced over at the kitchen door, Hermione was talking to someone.
""Harry!"" said Mum, jumping up to hug him. Ginny was frozen. She thought she'd be happy to see him after all this time but all she felt was anger. She was frustrated and hurt. She looked down at her hand, it was shaking like crazy.  She couldn't be around him right now. 

She snuck out the back and went to sit at the front of the orchard. She'd been going to sit under this tree since she was 8. When the twins wouldn't let her play Quidditch, when Ron would call her names, even after Tom. This was her tree, she thought it had calming properties. She looked at the little flowers growing at the roots of the tree. She liked flowers, she wouldn't dare tell her brothers because they'd hold it against her. She liked the way they danced in the wind and all the colors and patterns they come in. A small cluster of dandelions was growing. She couldn't help but think back to a date Harry took her on. He asked Hagrid if they could sit in his garden during lunch. He packed a picnic and they lied in the sun. They just talked and laughed. She found a similar cluster of dandelions and put them in his mess of a hair. He wore them the rest of the day with pride. There was a time where he wanted to be with her, a time where all he wanted was to be with her. She felt 11 again, falling for a guy who wanted nothing to do with her. The fact that he loved her, that cared so much about her is what kept her fighting. She wasn't so sure of that fact anymore.

 

	""Hey,"" There he was. Standing in front of her like nothing had happened. She was bitter, angry.

	""So... you decided we were worth talking to,"" she sneered. He looked hurt.

	""Ginny, I jus-""

	"" You just what!"" she snapped, "" You just want to apologize for what exactly?"" he stood silent for a second. He sat on the grass across from her.

	""I'm sorry for everything I've put you through. I couldn't face you after Remus, Tonks, Fred. I felt like I'd cost everyone so much,"" She wasn't surprised about the guilt, she knew he would have it.

	""That's not why I'm mad. I know those deaths weren't your fault, everyone knows that"" He looked up at her. His beautiful green eyes. 

	""You left me,"" she let out.

	""I didn't want to, I had to destroy the Horcruxes an-""

	""No, not when you left in August, after the battle. When you isolated yourself off from the rest of us,"" She stared in his eyes, She wanted him to understand her, feel her pain, "" Life was really difficult without you. Hogwarts was different, everyone was different"" He wouldn't meet her eyes, but she kept talking.

	""I was really worried I wouldn't get you back. I can't even describe the pain I felt when I thought you were dead,"" he finally looked at her.

	""When you pushed me away, I thought I just didn't matter to you,""

	""You mean everything to me,"" he grabbed her hands and held them.

	""How was I supposed to know? I was told you didn't want to talk to me or even look at me. I needed you Harry and you just,"" she couldn't finish her sentence. She was too riled up. Everything she felt over the past ten months was rushing back.

	""Ginny,"" he cupped her face with his hands. They were warm and calloused, ""I fucked up. I wanted nothing more than to hold you, but I felt I didn't deserve you. I thought I wasn't good enough for you,"" 

	""You don't get to make that decision, I do. I say you are one of the greatest things that have happened to me,"" He was kissing her. His soft lips locked with hers. The weight on her heart lifted. She felt so safe, so comforted. He pulled away slightly.

	""I love you, Ginny Weasley,"" he said into her mouth. She stared into his deep, green eyes. 

	""I love you too, Harry Potter,""

I hope you guys enjoy!!!!

Ginny and Bill have a lovely chat.

I decided to add dates to help the flow better. Also, I've been working on a playlist for this would you guys be interested.

May 17th, 1998

Ginny stood at the kitchen sink washing the mounds of dishes from tonight's dinner. She couldn't wait till she came of age. Washing dishes the muggle way was is exhausting. She practically had to fight her mum into letting it wait till morning. She never really planned on leaving it. Sleeping wasn't something Ginny was interested in recently. The nightmares were too real for her, they hurt too much. 

	""Ginny?"" Bill appeared from the stairwell, "" I thought you told Mum to leave it till morning?"" he said in an accusatory tone.

	""Well then I thought she might like the lie in,"" she said trying to cover her tracks. He took a seat at the table, grabbing one of the still warm tarts in the center. 

	""So, two more months until you're of age, huh,"" 

	""Yep, then I won't have to keep washing these by hand,"" she pulled her hands out of the sudsy water, exposing her pruned fingers. She was excited for her 17th, she'd been excited to finally be able to contribute to things. She won't be left to kitchen work or cleaning. 

	""Wow, the last Weasley to come of age. What's Mum gonna do without us?"" That had been something weighing on Ginny's mind recently. She couldn't just leave her alone. Yeah, she had Dad but was gonna return to work and the house would be empty. Charlie's already gone back to Romania, Bill and Fleur were sure to be leaving soon, Ron and Harry are trying to be Aurors. Who would look out for her, make sure she's ok. 

	""I was thinking about that actually. I'm thinking I could just stay home after school ends. Just to help out around the house and stuff,"" Bill looked up at her questioningly. Even she had to admit it didn't sound like her.

	""What about Quidditch? You wanted to go pro,"" he reminded her. She hadn't thought about playing in forever. She had dreamed of playing for the Harpies since she was a kid. It seemed within her grasp 5th year, but then everything happened. 

	""Well, Yeah I could just commute,"" she reassured him. He took out his wand and pointed it at the sink.

	""Scourgify,"" the sponge released itself from Ginny's grip and started washing the dishes, ""I think it's time had a little brother-sister chat,"" he gestured towards the chair opposite him. Ginny reluctantly dried her hands and took a seat.

	""What's the issue, brother?"" 

	""I've been noticing a few things recently,"" he had this slightly concerned look on his face. It was remarkable how much he looked like Dad.

	""Like what?"" she asked.

	""Well, you've done a lovely job of helping Mum. She really appreciates it, I can tell,"" His face had softened a little, but his brows still furrowed, ""I noticed how much you're helping George,"" She had been spending lots of time with George, being a shoulder to cry on and all that. She didn't like the idea of leaving him alone. It didn't feel like the right thing to do. 

	""I've also noticed you not getting to bed until very late,"" His face was now all concern, ""and I've noticed I haven't seen you cry since the battle,"" She didn't say anything, she couldn't say anything. She didn't know why she couldn't cry anymore, she'd spent the better half of ten months doing it. 

	""Well, you know me I'm not a whiner,"" 

	""It's not whining, It's grieving. I'm worried you're not doing it,""

	""I'm fine, Bill,"" she tried to reassure.

	""You shouldn't be, no one should be right now. I don't pretend to know what this year has been like for you, but I know it was painful,"" She couldn't meet his eyes. He just put his hand over hers

	""You don't need to be strong alone. I know it might feel like it but it's not. It doesn't have to be me, but just open up to someone,"" He came to her side of the table and gave her a tight hug. 

	""Now get some rest, no excuses,"" he pointed to the now empty sink. She stood up and gave him another hug, this time longer.

	""I can't sleep, I'm too scared,"" she whispered in his ear. She had been too afraid to talk about it before.

Bill pulled apart from her and looked at her. Ginny couldn't decipher the look, ""Then, for tonight, we won't,"" He walked away and went into the living room. He returned with their wizard chess set. 

	""We will play chess until morning or until I lose, same thing,"" he joked. Ginny smiled and sat back down.

""I only have one condition,"" said Bill, ""You talk to someone, okay?""

	""Okay,""

Ginny has a terrible dream.

CW: Mentions of blood and Torture!!!

May 19th, 1998It was cold and wet. The air too thick to breathe. She was back. Back in the Chamber. Her arms tied behind her back, forced to stare into the stone-cold eyes of Salazar Slytherin. The cut in her lip was dripping blood onto her uniform. She couldn't remember how she got there, she couldn't remember anything. She was terrified. Was she possessed again? What if she's hurt someone?

""No he's dead,"" she told herself. Suddenly the sound of heavy footsteps was approaching her. She closed her eyes tightly. She couldn't look at him. If she did, she wouldn't see Voldemort, she'd see Tom. Tom was scarier, he knew her. 

""Don't be scared. You're older now, stronger. You can take him,"" she had her fist clench, ready to fight. The steps got closer, but they weren't alone.

	""It looks like Miss Weasley is awake,"" she recognized the shrill, empty voice. Alecto Carrow. 

	""I think we hit her a little too hard, sissy,"" Amycus kneeled in front of her, inspecting her lip. 

	""That's what the little blood traitor deserves,"" sneered Alecto. Ginny jerked away as Amycus went to touch her lip. Her hands were bound too tightly, she couldn't get out. Amycus harshly grabbed her chin and closely examined her face. She met his cold eyes with a distasteful glare. 

	""What a shame. She's a beautiful pureblooded girl,"" he stroked her his finger up and down her cheek, ""too bad she let Potter use her,""

She was filled to the brim with anger. Her temper had always been her fatal flaw but it was more than that. She was vulnerable and she hated it. She spat in his face. He immediately jumped away.

	""Idiot girl!"" She couldn't help but laugh as he wiped the spit off his eyes.

	""You won't be laughing soon,"" Alecto pulled out her wand, ""Crucio!""

A wave of pain came over her. She shrieked out in pain. The last thing she saw was Tom Riddle and the Carrows standing over her writhing body. She jolted upright in her bed. Her forehead beading with sweat. It was a dream, only a dream. 

	""Ginny, you okay?"" Harry's voice was groggy. He and Hermione had been switching places every night since he got back. He sat up and put his hands on her cheek. Ginny jerked away from him, still tender from her nightmare. She could only focus on her shaking hand. 

	""Ginny, look at me,"" Harry's voice was soft, like velvet. She looked at him. He took her hand and pulled it to his chest, ""You're okay,"" 

As she looked into his eyes, her breathing got better and her hand steadied. She wasn't really there, she was safe. He wrapped his hands around her waist and they sat in each other embrace for a few minutes. She tried to forget what had happened, where she was. She just wanted to remember Harry, his arms, his voice. She savored it as if it was going to slip away.

	""Can you tell me what happened?"" He moved his hands to her face. She took a short breath trying to let herself back into that space. 

	""I was in the Chamber,"" she said. Harry gave her a solaced look. 

	""Was Tom there?"" 

	""No, not at first,"" 

	""What do you mean?"" he asked.

	""It was the Carrows they had hit me and tied me up. They stood there mocking me,"" she gave an empty laugh, ""They tortured me,""

Harry's face solidified. He was angry, she could tell by the way the corners of his lips straightened out. He took her hands again.

	""Gin? Is that what they did to you at Hogwarts?"" She hadn't told anyone what Hogwarts was like. She knew they'd look at her differently. She didn't want Harry to look at her differently. She wanted him to see the brave girl he fell in love with. The girl she wasn't sure she was anymore. She couldn't help it. They came rushing like an overrun dam. The tears just started to fall.

	""Ginny,"" he said with a sigh. He just pulled her down on the bed and into his arms. He didn't speak, he didn't ask any more questions, he just held her while she cried. 

	""I love you,"" he whispered as she drifted off to sleep.

Ginny and Percy visit Fred's grave

This is a short one. I based it off of a pretty popular headcannon. I didn't want this one to be too sad ;)

June 14th, 1998Ginny knelt in front of Fred's grave. She cleared out the old flowers from last week and replaced them with a new bouquet. This had become a routine of hers over the past few weeks. Sometimes Harry would join her, sometimes Ron or George. She liked going alone though, it gave her time to think. She'd think about what it would be like if he was here. Then she'd stop herself because it was a dangerous game. She couldn't linger in a world that wasn't real. For today, she just sat in silence. Mostly everyone was away at the Ministry, trials had begun. She wasn't allowed to go per usual. 

	""Oh, I thought everyone had gone out,"" a voice appeared behind her. She turned around, it was Percy, "" I'll just leave you be,"" 

	""No, stay please,"" she said. She hadn't talked to Percy much these couple of months. He sat kneeled down next to her, putting a piece of parchment behind him. She glanced at it, but Percy shoved it further behind him. Her curiosity had peaked.

	""What's on the parchment, Perce?"" she asked. 

	""It's nothing, it's just something silly,"" he picked up the parchment and skimmed over the words.

	""I'd love to hear something silly right now,"" she said with a smirk. 

	""It's just a list... of jokes. I don't know, I just he'd like them,"" Ginny couldn't hold back her smile. 

	""Can I hear some?"" she said interlocking her arm in his. He reluctantly pulled the glasses around his neck to his eyes. 

	""Why did the scarecrow win an award? He was outstanding in his field,"" Ginny let out a chuckle. It was the type of corny joke Fred would say. Percy laughed with her. They spent the next couple of minutes laughing at the list. Ginny even came up with a few of her own. They were a bit racier than the ones Percy came up with.

	""I thought of one, but I don't know,"" 

	""Go on Perce, don't be shy,"" 

	""This graveyard looks overcrowded, people must be dying to get in,"" said Percy in the most deadpan voice. There was a moment of silence and they both burst out laughing. 

	""Oh, my Merlin, Perce! Didn't think you had it in you!"" exclaimed Ginny. 

	""I didn't either,"" he said through his laugh. 

	""He would've really liked that one,"" Ginny patted him on the back.

	""You think so?"" She looked at his face. There was still a smile but there was something behind his eyes. Something heartbreaking.

	""You're a great brother, Percy."" All she could do was give him a hug and hope that the words sunk in.

A look into the first Sunday dinner at the Weasley's

This one really happy cuz the next ones pretty sad so enjoy :)

June 25th, 1998
""Ginny, will you put the brisket on the table? Oh Ron, put a warming charm on it,"" The kitchen was bustling with people all following Mum's orders. Bill had introduced the idea of Sunday dinners after he and Fleur went back to Shells Cottage. Mum loved the idea, any reason to cook for an excess amount of people. She was in such high spirits, she even let Fleur prepare a dish.


""It certainly looks interesting,"" Ginny whispered to Harry as he set the plates. They stared at the large bowl containing a sluggish, brown liquid.

""Definitely interesting,"" he smirked. They all took their seats around the table, looking curiously into the bowl of steaming liquid. Everyone grabbed large servings of Mum's brisket and potatoes. They also grabbed unnaturally small portions of Fleur's soup.


""I 'ope you all enjoy! I vorked all nigh',"" she had a wide smile across her face.


""Yes love, very delicious,"" Bill glared at all of them, reminding them to be polite. Ginny could barely hold down the soup as it slicked down her throat. She glanced over at Hermione, who was discreetly casting a spell over her bowl.


""Ginny, I don't think he's is coming down tonight. Can you bring him a plate?"" she said. George had gotten better at coming down for breakfast and lunch, but dinner was still pretty difficult.


""No problem,"" Ginny grabbed an extra plate piling on food. She also grabbed a hefty helping of Fleur's soup.


""George,"" she knocked on his door, ""I have dinner,""


""Come in,"" Ginny opened the door and saw George examining some sort of paper. She set the plate and bowl down, ""Thanks,"" he absentmindedly took a large scoop of the soup.


""Ack! What is that,"" he groaned, spitting it back into the bowl.


""Fleur made it,"" She laughed.


""Beautiful woman, terrible cook,"" he said shaking his head.


""Well, Mum's made sherbert, so that might help that taste,""


""What flavor?"" he asked his eyes now a glow like a little kid.


""Strawberry, but if you want it you have to come down,"" she added.


""Fine,"" he grabbed his plate, leaving the bowl of soup at his desk.

They headed down together, Ginny caught the smile on her Mum's face as they came. George took a seat on the other side of her. The Sunday dinner was a rising success, despite the disastrous soup. For dessert, they all took an extra helping of Mum's sherbert.


""You know I was thinking..."" They all looked at George, who was now addressing the whole table, ""I wanna open the shop again,""

Ginny, Harry, Hermione, and Ron pack up Fred's things. CONTENT WARNING!!!! PANIC ATTACK!!!!!

Sorry, I haven't updated in a bit got distracted by the holidays and school but here you got! :)

July 2nd, 1998

The apartment was dim and messy. Despite the array of orange and purple decor, it all looked dull. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny sat on the floor of the living room, packing away bits and pieces of Fred's things. With every box that was taped up, there was a silent goodbye to the friend and brother they knew. Ginny didn't resist her mum when she asked her to help pack things, she would take whatever chance she could to grieve her brother. She didn't want to keep it all locked up anymore, it hurt worst than letting it go. 

	""Is that everything?"" asked Hermione, holding a box.

	""I think there are a couple more things in his room,"" said Ron, ""I'll pack it,""

	""It'll be easier if I do it since I can't Apparate yet,"" Ginny handed her box off to Harry.

	""You sure?"" asked Hermione, giving her a knowing look.

	""Yeah, you guys can just get the key from George and we can lock up everything when you come to get me,"" 

	""Alright, we'll be back soon,"" Harry shot her a comforting smile. She just nodded her as they Apparated to the Burrow. 

The apartment was now silent, an uncomfortable silence. She walked over to the now empty room that used to belong to Fred. The room where her brother planned to call home. He'd only been there for a year or two, but he left his mark.  She brushed her fingers against the empty patches where Fred had hung his posters. The only thing left was a small corkboard covered in ribbons and photos. 

She one by one pulled each item down, taking her time to think fondly of all the ones she could remember. A family Christmas photo from when she was only four. It was the year they turned Ron's hair a vibrant green. The only thing Ginny could remember was the horrified look on Mum's face. A face she'd now come to associate with the twins. She looked at the things she didn't remember. A photo of Him, Angelina, George, and Lee having a pint of Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks. She thought about the way he would've cherished this moment. Cherishing it enough to pin it on a wall he looked at every night. She unpinned a photo. November 1995 Dumbledore's Army. Everyone had gotten their own copy of the photo. Fred had cherished this time in his life. A time when they were just kids wanting to fight for something, stand for something. She looked over everyone's face, wide smiles all around. The widest of all, Colin Creevy. One of the few pictures he was actually in. Ginny remembers having to coerce him into being in it, how'd he had to be a part of history. 

Was it worth it? she asked herself. The thought had been circling her brain for the past week. Was the glory worth it all? She brushes a finger over Colin's smiling face. A boy she'd grown up with. The first one to forgive her after being possessed. A real person who had hopes and dreams he could no longer accomplish. How many people would look at this picture and not give him a second glance? The face of a boy who gave his life for the cause.

 Ginny's throat was tightening up. It felt like a ton of bricks was sitting on her chest. She slowly let herself down onto the ground. She couldn't even pay attention to her shaking hand. She was already gone, gone back to that day. Ginny remembered sneaking Colin and a few others back into the castle. She thought back to the way Oliver carried his body into the Great Hall. The guilt she felt when she saw him, was amplified sitting in the room of her own dead brother. How many times had Dennis sat in his brother's room wishing he'd never gone back to the castle, wishing he'd just been sent away. 

The grief washed over her. She couldn't breathe anymore and the tears kept running down her face. They'd never see the flash of Colin's camera, the sharpness of Fred's smirk, the vibrance of Tonk's hair ever again. They were gone forever, leaving broken people in their trail.

	""Ginny?"" She heard Harry's heavy footsteps enter the room. She felt his arms wrap around her. She almost collapsed under his touch.

	""Ginny, look at me,"" he gently pulled her crying face to look at him, ""You're okay, you're okay,"" 

His voice was so comforting and warm. She felt safe with him in his arms. She looked around and saw Ron and Hermione standing in the doorway. Ginny wasn't the type to be vulnerable. She could count on one hand how many times Ron had seen her cry, but she didn't care. All she wanted to focus on was Harry. He was willing to share her burden, he was begging to.

	""It won't last, Ginny. It'll get better,"""

The woman herself seemed weaker than usual, her age for once showing through the cracks of bravery. For those who knew her, it didn't matter. They would always see the woman who was a loving mother for every student and the worst fear of anyone who tried to harm them.

People walked around the cemetery with bouquets of white flowers in their hands, some saving them for their lost loved ones while others placed one on every grave. No one deserved to live more than the others.

Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley walked with their fingers intertwined, as the girl was left with only one rose in her hand. He didn't dare to ask who she was saving it for and he only realized it when he saw the name on the headstone.

Lavender Brown. Two dates with a hyphen short like the eighteen years it represented. A picture of the blonde smiling widely in front of Honeydukes. That was all that was left of the girl.

Hermione's hands were shaking as she placed the rose next to the dozens of others. She wished she could remember Lavender laughing. But she couldn't. All she could think about when it came to her was her pale face, drained of blood and her eyes empty, which is what she looked like when Hermione's spell pushed Greyback off of her. If only she had gotten there a minute earlier...

Ron said nothing and just held her hand tighter as if he could listen to her thoughts. Thankfully, she didn't have the time to go over her actions of three years ago once more, as two familiar figures arrived. Padma could barely hold Parvati who was breaking down for yet another year in front of her best friend's grave, but she managed to nod to the couple. They both smiled sympathetically and moved on, letting the girl grieve.

Ginny had left Harry's side and was talking quietly with Dean and Seamus, but the boy barely noticed since he was busy trying to calm his godson, who was tossing and turning unstoppably in his arms. The three-year-old seemed more restless than ever, as if he understood the sorrow of the day and reacted as a toddler was expected. His hair had been a dull grey-brown color all day and his eyes were a really sweet brown, but looked red and swollen from all the crying.

Andromeda offered to help once again, but Harry refused. The woman was old and tired, especially on that day. Besides, they were almost there.

The headstone was larger than the others, providing space for two names and birthdays. No one would notice the age difference as all they would pay attention to would be the radiating love in the picture below. It was Christmas and the couple was slow dancing in front of the Christmas tree in Grimmauld Place's living room, the movement caught for eternity in the magic photograph.

Harry let Teddy on his feet and after being pulled away from his godfather's leg twice, carefully but curiously approached the grave. He pulled the picture into his small hands and it was true magic, the way his eyes lit up green like his father's and his hair burst bubblegum pink like his mother's.

""Mama!"" he said gleefully, his laugh the only happy sound that had been heard in the cemetery in ages. Harry smiled but it quickly faded away as he heard the sob that had escaped Andromeda's lips. He gently placed an arm around her shoulders as she cried and wiped her eyes in a tissue for the hundredth time that day and then cried again.

""She was so young... they loved each other so much..."" she muttered in his shirt and he didn't reply. He would lie if he said that he didn't miss Tonks's pink hair and curses every time she tripped on something in the hallway or Lupin's stories about his parents and the calmness in his face ever since he admitted he was in love with Dora. They shouldn't have died. They should be there to dance in front of the tree after every Christmas dinner. Teddy should have grown to learn how amazing his parents are. But he couldn't say that to Andromeda, because she already knew.

Even though she was too young to realize, Victoire Weasley, who turned one on that day, was the only thing that helped a number of people keep it together on that day. She was just sitting in her father's arms, playing with his fang earring in her delicate fingers, but her blonde hair, blue eyes and cute baby smile were enough to mesmerize everyone. Molly had actually managed to smile at the sight of her first grandchild extending her arms towards her, but Bill didn't hand her the baby because he knew how fragile his mother was. He had Arthur on her one side, the man saying less than ever, and Charlie on the other, who only came home from Romania on that particular day every year, just to hold his mom's hand.

But no one seemed to be able to help George. The boy had his legs crossed on the ground and the wind messed with his ginger hair and his hands were dirty from the soil and every now and then people talked to him but he never replied. The only people he had reacted to since he had claimed that spot in front of the grave, surrounded by too many white roses, were Lee Jordan who had come back for the first time after he moved to Australia a few months after the battle and Angelina who was a sobbing mess and he couldn't help but hug.

But he didn't speak to either of them. He hugged them and patted their backs, but he saved his voice for when the sun set and the last people were finally heading home and Bill had said something about Vic's birthday cake in the fridge before apparating with his daughter and wife.

The picture was one of the few of Fred alone. He was in his dress robes, the night of the Yule Ball and what hurt the most was that his laugh came from some joke George, who was behind the camera, had made on his nervousness. Pain swelling up inside him, be threw the frame on the ground, upside down, the sound of the breaking glass the only sound in the cemetery.

George tried to convince himself to stand up and leave, but he couldn't. So he stayed there for minutes, for hours. He was alone in a graveyard of grey tombstones and the sky was painted orange like his hair and the grass was green and covered in white roses and yet all he could see was his brother's brown eyes losing their light right in front of him, three years ago on that day.

So he moved to plan B. Maybe if he talked some weight would be lifted of his chest and it would be easier to stand up and move and walk and breathe. It was worth a shot.

""A couple of years ago,"" he started and his voice was hoarse, ""I wanted to talk to someone about... this. You. Dying. The problem was that the only person I would ever want to talk about something that serious with was also you. I couldn't go to mom because she would break down, or anyone else in our family because I knew they would treat me like a ticking bomb and try really hard to find the right thing to say when all I wanted was someone to talk."" It was true. For months after the battle, the few times he would leave his room and go down to the living room every discussion would stop and everyone would stare at him, waiting for him to cry or scream or explode or something like that.

""I thought of Hermione, because you know, that girl has a solution for everything and I think she would be honest with me, but I don't know if she would truly understand,"" he said, pulling at the grass without thinking, ""she hasn't lost anyone that close to her.""

""Then there was Harry,"" he continued. ""But the guy had just defeated the Dark Lord. And he was seventeen. He deserved a break. Everyone owed him a break. Lee moved to Australia and didn't come back for years and strangely enough, I found myself going to a person that had never crossed my mind before.""

He picked up the picture again before continuing, already feeling bad about breaking it. She fixed it and put it back in place, hoping that it would feel more like he was talking to him. ""Andromeda Tonks. Let me tell you something, that woman is strong. And she understood. She lost Sirius and her husband and Tonks and Lupin and even that terrible sister of hers and it was the first time I felt that the advice was coming from someone who had been through the same thing as me.""

He didn't feel any better, but he couldn't stop. Even if everything sucked just as bad afterwards, he had nothing to lose.

""She told me the worst day was one morning that she woke up and she didn't remember her husband's laugh. She told me she went crazy because for a long while, when her family had disowned her because she fell in love and everything seemed to get worse, all that kept her going was his laugh, the only thing that made her believe that maybe there is hope,"" he said and his voice broke at the last word and he brought his dirty hand to his face to realize he was crying. He put his fingers back into the grass and continued.

""She had promised herself that she would never forget him, or any of the people she has lost and yet every morning she wakes up and realizes something else is missing and even though she has come to terms with the fact that it's inevitable and one day the memory of their presence will be something hard to remember, she keeps pictures of them all around the house.""

His breathing was getting faster and unsteady and more tears were streaming down his face, yet he hadn't moved an inch, his fingers gripping right on the grass as if it was the only thing keeping him on the ground.

""Do you know why I'm telling you all this?"" he asked and there was no one around to answer, especially not Fred. ""Because I catch myself wishing I was in her place. Wishing that every morning another part of you would be gone because that would mean that maybe one day I would forget the pain too,"" he sobbed and wiped his tears on his sleeves as more took their place.

""But I will never be able to do that. Because I look in the mirror and you are right there staring back at me and every time I speak it's like hearing you and some days I am really tempted to dye my hair blond or blue or green to stop looking like you and only eat ice for a week to screw up my voice and make it stop sounding like yours,"" he yelled and he knew he was sounding at a piece of rock among more pieces of rock that would never be able to truly represent and fill the void of the names carved on them, but the weight was slightly lifted.

""But I still wouldn't forget you because our eyes would still be the same. Sometimes I'm just so jealous of Teddy who can change everything on him and be someone entirely different. Although I'm sure once he grows up and learns to control it, he will choose to look like the perfect combination of Tonks and Remus.""

It was getting harder to shout, his throat sore after all the yelling, so he inevitably got quieter. The absence of volume in his voice reflected on him as well, as he suddenly felt much more tired and heavy.

""And he will have every right to, because his parents were great and should be remembered. And you should be remembered too and no matter how much I shout at your grave, it is going to happen. Because that's what people do, Freddie. We lose someone and whatever part of the universe was filled with them is suddenly filled with pain, so we cling onto that pain because the alternative would be to let that part of the universe fade and no one can ever do that. I'm not even making sense right now,"" he said and in one quick movement he was one his feet and stepping backwards, his eyes fixed on his brother's picture.

His clothes were slightly green from the grass and his hands were full of dirt and his face was stained with tears and a part of him wanted to run and never come back, but how could he? Instead he gave one last look to the place he sat and with five last words he apparated right into his room in the Burrow.

""See you in the mirror."""

Saturday, May 2, 1998

Draco's heart sunk into his stomach as he watched the line of Death Eaters approaching and listened to the booming voice of his Dark Lord announcing their doom. No. He wasn't supposed to think of this as doom. Harry Potter's death would be cause for celebration, right? I'm one of them, Draco told himself, and tried to feel happy about it. Tried to feel happy about his dead classmate. Tried to feel happy that the last chance to escape the Dark Lord's terrifying regime was gone.

	He could barely hear his master's speech over the rushing in his ears, so overwhelmed by exhaustion and emotion, Draco wasn't sure he could continue to stand. It had been such a long battle. Then Lucius stepped forward just a bit from the Death Eaters' front line, beckoning him over. His mother made it clear it was time for him to come back to their side. He could barely remember how he came to be standing on the side of good in the first place. Now that he was here, however....

	He felt his feet start to shuffle. His survival instincts were kicking in, even while his heart was debating the move. His gaze was focused on his mother, but to the side, he could see that the Dark Lord was looking displeased, his wand starting to move upward. Draco knew he needed to move faster. He was too exhausted to withstand a crucio right now with any kind of dignity. And he was in enough trouble already if it was discovered what had happened. Suddenly, Lord Voldemort was screaming, then laughing maniacally as an angry hissing sound filled the courtyard.

	Draco turned to see where the sound was coming from. Granger. The bushy-haired mudblood freak was standing above something billowing nasty black smoke from the ground, a fang of some sort held triumphantly over her head. He tried not to think it, but she looked like an avenging angel. The oily looking smoke came out as a hissing snake then formed into a terrifying version of the Dark Lord, hovering over them all and reaching out to murder oily little figures that flashed up as one soldier of good after another. Granger wasn't cowering, but tears streamed down her face as the phantom Dark Lord told her she was the only one left, that they were all dead or had abandoned the cause. 

But there was her disgusting ginger sidekick right beside her. Ron Weasley took her hand and started shouting. ""She'll never be alone! Harry may be gone, but he left us to finish the job. Dumbledore told us what to do and we're going to get it done!""

	A cheer went up. Many voices cried out. ""She has us!"" ""You can't take us down!"" ""Dumbledore's Army!""

	Draco sneered as he recognized the call for that little Order kids' club from back in fifth year. He might not know what to think about his Dark Lord, but he certainly still knew how he felt about all of them. And especially that idiot Weasley, who stooped to pick up the smoking object. The smoke was starting to drain away. Laughing, the ginger threw it out into the courtyard between the two groups. 

	""There's your tiara, Snakeface. Sorry it's looking a little dark and twisted now.""'

	The Dark Lord was clearly livid. And Draco was suddenly terrified as he realized what that ""tiara"" really was - Ravenclaw's Diadem. The Diadem he had been tasked with protecting at all costs. He was a dead man. All the near misses so far tonight were just going to mean a longer, more painful death. Probably for his family as well. It didn't matter that Lord Voldemort had given incredibly vague instructions. It didn't matter that Draco didn't know what the thing he was guarding looked like or where it was within the room. All that would matter is that he had failed again. The mark tethered him to the Dark Lord, but perhaps he could help his mother escape before.....he couldn't stand to think about what would come. There was no escape for him now.

	""BLIMEY!"" the half-giant carrying Harry's body suddenly bellowed. Draco had always despised that creature they had been forced to endure as a teacher. Hagrid was crying, apparently with joy, as he yelled, ""E's breathin!"" At that announcement, Harry Potter rolled out of Hagrid's arms just as the dazzling green light of the Dark Lord's avada would have hit him, taking down the half-giant instead. Potter gaped, pausing too long to stare before turning to run. A slicing curse from somewhere in the Death Eater crowd hit his leg, bringing him crashing to the ground. Suddenly, the battle erupted everywhere around them.

**************************************

	Just one more Horcrux left. And Harry was alive! Finishing off the Diadem meant they only had the snake to kill. Hermione held tight to Ron's hand as they pushed through the chaos around them. They had to get to Harry!

	They were so focused, Ron didn't realize he had been hit until he fell over, completely paralyzed from the body-bind. Hermione dodged the one aimed at her. Yaxley was after them, she thought. Whispering a quick counter-curse, she was able to free Ron. She turned quickly, screaming, ""Protego!"" just in time to deflect a Sectumsempra from nearby. Glancing to the side when she heard Ron grunt, she saw that he was now dueling Yaxley. Beyond him, Professor Flitwick and Lupin were taking on Dolohov. To the side, she saw Justin Fitch-Fletchley, Seamus, and Susan Bones facing off against several masked Death Eaters. Molly Weasley had just finished taking one down across the room. A white-blond head dodged in and out behind a tapestry, throwing curses at Death Eaters. Hermione was certain she was seeing things because the only person with hair like that was Draco Malfoy.

	Her momentary distraction allowed a stinging hex to hit her arm. It wasn't anything she couldn't handle, but got her attention. She shot a stunner at MacNair, who apparently had been aiming for Luna. She turned to head for Harry again, when, to her right, she heard the shrill laughter of a woman she had hoped to never face again.

*************************************

	Neville gasped when Harry went to his knees right in front of him. He knew, as the member of Dumbledore's Army closest, it was his duty to back up Harry, get him on his feet and fighting. Or, as Harry tried to stand and failed, do the fighting for him. Neville began shooting curses toward Voldemort, who was advancing menacingly toward Harry. It was odd that he hadn't sent an avada at his friend again, but Neville was happy to draw the crazed wizard's attention away before he tried.

	Harry gave up trying to stand as he watched Voldemort face off with the boy everyone had once considered hopeless at magic. Neville might not have a lot of finesse, but somewhere along the line, he had certainly found his power. He was holding his own. It wouldn't be enough to defeat him, but it was enough for the moment. Harry had to get his own spell in at a time when it wouldn't hit Neville, but was sure to take Voldemort down. Finally, he saw his opening.

	""Expelliarmus!""

	Neville's wand blasted over to Harry. Voldemort began to laugh, and then to advance toward Harry. For Harry, the sounds of battle receded so that it was just he and Voldemort. He knew, distantly, that someone was calling his name, but it was muted. In the eerie silence, Harry could suddenly hear a soft song, one he recognized instantly. 

Fawkes! The beautiful phoenix swooped by, dropping the sorting hat at Neville's feet and flying straight at Voldemort's eyes. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Neville reaching into the hat and pulling forth the sword of Gryffindor. Maybe the snake is nearby, Harry thought, hoping that Neville or someone might take it out before he and Voldemort finished their business. Harry struggled up from the ground despite the pain in his leg.

""Just you and me, Riddle. We were always meant to fight this final battle, you and I.""

Voldemort laughed maniacally and responded with ""Avada Kedavra!"" 

Harry barely threw up a shield, and not a very good one at that. He had expected more talking first. The shield almost held. It gave him time to dodge. When the spell broke through, the light was a pale yellow-green and just barely hit his left arm. The piercing laughter was all he heard for a moment. Then a surprised grunt just as things went black.

Neville had been bewildered when he pulled the sword out of the hat. As Harry crumpled to the ground, he knew exactly what to do with it. Silently, so as to give no warning above Voldemort's disturbing laughter, Neville charged straight at him, sword held like a lance with both hands. He plunged it straight through his goal, but not high enough. Neville rammed himself up against Voldemort and started trying to pull the sword out, planning for the heart next. A physical attack had not been expected and Voldemort was falling to the ground from his wound. It wasn't immediately fatal enough for Neville, but it was certainly enough to take the monster to the ground.

************************************

	Lucius Malfoy raced to his master's side, blowing the boy away from him with a well-aimed confrigo as he neared. Voldemort was barely conscious from the pain and the blood he was quickly losing. 

	""Cissy! Come attend our Lord."" His wife knelt beside him. ""Get him back to the Manor and healed. I'll join you soon enough.""

	""Lucius, I can't!""

	""It wasn't a question.""

	""Draco! Lucious, if I must go, you have to swear to me you'll find him.""

	""Of course I won't leave the boy here. Now go!""

	With his beloved wife and the Dark Lord gone, Lucius breathed a sigh of relief. He stood, shot red sparks into the air and cast so that his voice would be heard in the ear of every Death Eater. ""The Dark Lord wants prisoners as we return. Leave this place."" Looking around, he saw only Neville Longbottom where there should have been Harry Potter as well. He grabbed the limp body in one hand, the discarded sword in the other, and disapparated home just long enough to drop the incarceroused boy in a heap by the sitting room door. Then he was back and searching.

	He knew from that moment at the beginning, the moment he wouldn't come to them, that the worthless brat wasn't wearing his robes and mask like he should be. Was there nothing the child wouldn't fail at? At least that was a help now. The boy's hair wasn't long and flowing like his own, but how hard could it be to find someone with a glowing white-gold mop on their head? Harder, it seemed, than he had hoped. 

	Looking around, he saw his brother-in-law Rodolphus apparate away with a girl he didn't know. McGonagall was backed into a corner by Dolohov. Rowle was fighting down one of the Weasley boys, an older one Lucius thought. Fenrir scooped up an armload of little children - what they were even doing in the midst of a battle, he couldn't imagine. A girl he recognized as Pansy Parkinson grabbed on as Greyback disapparated back to the manor. Bellatrix was still battling. As he watched, Molly Weasley fell to the ground, the three girls she had been protecting crestfallen and terrified behind her. That was the moment he finally found what he was looking for. 

	Draco darted forward, out of his hiding place and headed toward the battle with his Aunt Bella. He didn't even notice his father standing to the side until Lucius grabbed him by the collar and spun them both around in apparition. They landed hard in the sitting room, surrounded by the chaos of the angry and the wounded.

I do not own Harry Potter or any of the characters or canon world-building associated with the books JK Rowling wrote. Sad but true.

Sunday, May 3, 1998; late morning

	Six red heads bowed together, arms around one another, most sobbing with all they had. They were losing too much. Mum was in the Hospital Wing under Madam Pomfrey's care, Charlie and Fleur were missing, and Fred.......Fred was gone forever. To make matters worse, especially for the youngest two, Harry Potter was unconscious as well. And Hermione was gone, taken by Bellatrix LeStrange and undoubtedly a captive of the Death Eaters now.

	None of them had slept much throughout the long, sad night. When anyone would drift off for a moment, they were inevitably brought awake by their nightmares or the broken sobs of the others.

	Ron pulled away from the heartbroken group. ""I have to do something. I need to get to Hermione. Find Charlie. I don't hope he got caught, but I hope Hermione isn't there alone. Fleur either, I guess.""

	""No chance of that,"" the familiar voice of his once-professor spoke. Remus Lupin put his hand on Ron's shoulder, perhaps for comfort, perhaps to hold him in place, ""I don't know if Charlie was captured, but there were others who were seen being taken. Hermione isn't alone.""

	Ron felt himself go even paler, and then red with fury. ""Who else?"" he growled, ""Who else did they get tonight!?""

	His father stepped up, ""Ron. We don't know yet. There are quite a few people missing, son."" Ron rounded on his father and fought the urge to shout or take a swing.

	Lupin interjected, ""McGonagall. Seamus saw Dolohov capture and take her. Greyback took someone.""

	Ron couldn't believe McGonagall had been captured. He felt like his whole world was reeling. How could he be the one of his friends left standing? What if it came down to him now? There was a brief vision of the glory he wouldn't have to share after killing Voldemort, but....could he even do anything without Harry and Hermione? They had always been the important ones - the ""Chosen One,"" destined to defeat Voldemort, and everyone knew that Hermione was the brains behind their trio. How could he hope to save the world they knew on his own? Ron steeled himself. He might just have to be that savior, no matter what. He was the last horcrux hunter. The snake still lived, plus He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named as far as he knew. When he grabbed Harry and got him away, Ron knew the darkest wizard had seen him, looked directly at him. He might be injured, but he wasn't dead then and it was too much to hope that the Death Eaters would have let him die. No, it was certain he, Ron, had work to do.

	Ron turned on his heel, ready to charge off. Lupin and Arthur appeared on each of his sides, ""No.""

""Get out of my way!""

""No, son. We can't let you go marching off by yourself with no plans and no supplies.""

""When was the last time you ate?"" 

Ron's traitorous stomach growled. His head and body ached from exhaustion and the minor wounds he had taken throughout the long day. In truth, he had no idea where to start, just the frantic need to do something. Whatever that something might be, it would have to wait a little while.

********************************

	Hermione felt like her head would split open. It took her a moment to come up with any memory of what might have happened. She jolted suddenly awake as she realized who had her and where she might have been taken. To her relief, Hermione found herself in a dungeon rather than with Bellatrix LeStrange. 

	""Miss Granger!"" cried her beloved headmistress, a voice that brought Hermione great comfort and, in this situation, distress. She looked up into Headmistress McGonagall's worried face and realized there were others leaning in around them. The light was a dim grey from a window high above, but it was enough to make out faces near her. Ron's brother Charlie was there, Professor Flitwick, Neville, one of the Patil twins, and Hannah Abbott all staring at her. Beyond them, she saw some young ones, probably just first years, clinging to none other than Pansy Parkinson. Fleur was with them as well, trying to calm the children. Beside her were a couple of young muggleborns, probably fifth or sixth years, whose names Hermione didn't know though she thought one of them might be Justin Finch-Fletchley's brother. They were talking quietly with Terry Boot.

	Sitting up made her head spin and stomach lurch, but Hermione moved anyway, ""Wh-what happened? Where are we?""

	""Dungeons of Malfoy Manor, love,"" said Charlie, ""Not surprised Death Eater headquarters would be here, eh?""

	""No. Not a surprise,"" she shuddered with the memory of the last time she had been in this Manor. It had been a miracle to escape it once. She was sure this time she would die here. 

	""How do you feel, Miss Granger? What do you remember?"" This from Professor Flitwick.

	""I...Molly was fighting Bellatrix. Luna, Ginny, and I were there and had tried. Molly fell - is she ok?"" There were worried looks around her. Poor Charlie had paled. Clearly no one knew. ""Bellatrix was going for Ginny next. So I...I pushed her out of the way and tried to take her on myself. I think I shot her with a slicing hex, but I can't remember anything after that. Did Ginny escape?"" Again, there were no answers. Hermione sighed and pushed forward, ""She's not here at least. Hopefully that means the best. What do each of you remember?""

	Everyone reported what they had seen or heard before they were taken. The worst information came from Neville. Oh, Harry.

	Hermione was so distracted worrying about what might be going on outside their world, that she barely noticed how dark it was getting. She didn't even register at first that someone was approaching. In the light of a glowing wand tip, silvery blond hair glowed.

	""Malfoy,"" Neville snarled, ""I can't believe you'll show your face...""

	""Shut up,"" Draco hissed, ""I've brought food you're not allowed to have."" He began passing bread and cheese through the door. ""Eat quick. There's to be a Revel tonight, now that the Dark Lord is recovered. You'll need strength.""

	""Thank you, Mister Malfoy,"" Headmistress McGonagall said, ""Can we assume they will be retrieving some of us for this...Revel?""

	""All of you. Has everyone...come back yet?""

	""All awake and as good as can be expected,"" Professor Flitwick reported.

	Hermione was confused. Malfoy looked terrified, constantly checking over his shoulder and nervously swaying on his feet. ""Malfoy. Why are you risking yourself to bring us food?"" She couldn't stop herself from asking.

	He growled back at her, then quickly spun and disappeared up a staircase somewhere to the left of their cell. 

 

	Hermione soon found herself marching up that same staircase, bound magically at the wrists, along with all the other prisoners. They were drug single file into what could only be a ballroom. The opulence was overwhelming after nothing but darkness and the rough stone walls of the cell below. Here there was gold and marble everywhere, with multiple chandeliers even larger than the one Hermione had nearly been crushed by previously. At one end, there was a large dais. To one side, there was a grand piano and several other seats for musicians. In the center, clearly not an original part of the decor, there was what could only be called a throne. A series of chairs were placed on each side of his throne, but they were empty tonight. His throne was not.

	The prisoners were shoved to the ground directly in front of the dais.

	""Ah,"" the satisfied sound slithered from Voldemort's lips, ""So nice of you to join us. So many of you that I especially wanted to see.""

	No one made a sound. He hissed. ""You say 'thank you, my lord' or you face the consequences.""

	""Never,"" Neville challenged, ""I will never call you that. Can't imagine a situation where I'd thank you either.""

	""Crucio! As if I need another reason to offer you my special attention, foolish child."" Neville screamed as Lord Voldemort stood and looked out over the crowd of laughing Death Eaters. He did not let up his curse as he monologued Neville's part in the battle, ""My friends, do you know what this pathetic child did? He used a sword to try and kill me. As you all know, I can not be killed, can NOT die. But even if I could, he was too stupid to do it right. Aren't you?"" He turned back to Neville as he let up on the spell. ""What's your name, boy?""

	""Neville."" He struggled into a standing position, ""Longbottom.""

	He clearly intended to say more, likely something worse, when Minerva McGonagall surged up like a Mama Bear. ""That is quite enough said, Mr. Longbottom. Lord Voldemort, if you must torture, let it be me..."" 

	""Or me,"" Professor Flitwick cut in.

	""...rather than the children. They were only following orders.""

	Voldemort's shrill laughter filled the hall, quickly followed by the laughter of his minions. He sat down as he said, ""You expect me to believe they were just following orders? Some of them, perhaps. But dear Headmistress, you have Harry Potter's pet Mudblood. You have my would-be murderer here. They are taking orders from the wrong people to be forgiven now.""

	""Be that as it may...""

	McGonagall was interrupted by clicking boot heels. Bellatrix LeStrange was dressed for a fun night. Her entire outfit was leather and lace, barely there, with heels 5 inches high. It was clear what she expected to be doing at this Revel. Her hair was just as wild as always, her eyes a bit more deranged than usual. She looked over the prisoners with hunger and insanity. ""Did I hear that boy is Neville Longbottom?""

	""Oh yes, my dear,"" Voldemort replied. ""I thought you might enjoy playing with him when I am done.""

	""I would be delighted, my Lord! I've always wondered if he would like to join Mummy and Daddy.""

	Neville launched himself from the floor straight at her. He would have tackled her, but the Dark Lord made a swatting motion as though going after a fly and Neville hit the floor hard enough to knock him out again. 

	Bellatrix stamped her foot. ""You weren't supposed to ruin the fun of him so soon!"" she whined.

	""We can ennervate him when we're ready. I have other important matters to attend to first.""

	""Oh I hope it's something fun! I could always amuse myself with another of them - I have some unfinished business with the Mudblood and isn't that redhead just delicious looking? - but I do enjoy watching you work, my Lord."" She looked like a little girl, excited over too many playthings to choose.

	""Some of us will be having fun. Some within this hall, however, are traitors and will be having a less enjoyable - but very entertaining - time."" He called out, ""Lucius. Narcissa."" The two scurried to place themselves in front of their master as someone, Yaxley, Hermione thought, yanked the prisoners back by their invisible ropes.

	""You lied to me, Narcissa. I am lucky to be sitting here right now because you lied that the Potter boy was dead.""

	""No! No, my Lord! I would never lie to you! I couldn't. There was no breath, no heartbeat when I...""

	""ENOUGH!"" the Dark Lord roared. ""I know what you did and didn't do. I know now that you wish me dead. I know and I won't forget. Neither, my dear, will you be able to forget that I know. Lucius, as you could not control your wife to love me as she should, as you couldn't keep her from trying to undermine my very life, you will need to prove to me that you can control her. You will punish her.""

	""Yes, my Lord, of course,"" Lucius looked relieved, ""I will make sure she pays for this and will never do such a thing again.""

	""You will do it here. Right now. It will begin with Crucio. 5 straight minutes should be a good start.""

	""But, my Lord, she can't..."" he didn't look relieved any longer.

	""Do you question me?"" Voldemort hissed. Narcissa's screams filled the hall. They never ended and it felt like glass inside Hermione's ears. Looking around, she saw Malfoy - Draco - watching from the side, about 3 shades paler than usual. He was trying to mask the horror he felt, but failing miserably. Finally, finally, the time was up and Narcissa lay crumpled in a gasping heap. Lucius started to run to her, but his Lord shook his head no. 

""What do you think next? The same again, or is it time to start the physical beating?"" Lucius looked like he might be ill at any moment. ""My Lord, please. She is fragile already, has been ever since Draco was born.""

""Ah...Yes. Draco can take her place then. Only, he has his own transgressions to atone for as well. Dolohov, you were there when I was assigning posts. Who was tasked with protecting the Diadem of Ravenclaw?""

Dolohov chuckled darkly, ""Draco Malfoy, my Lord.""

Hermione could hear shuffling amongst the Death Eaters, and the boy who had bullied and tormented her since the first day she entered the wizarding world was shoved from the crowd out in front of the dais hard enough to land him face first on the floor. He immediately scrambled onto his knees and groveled. ""Please, my Lord. I tried to keep it away from them. I tried..."" Then he was screaming as his body arched and convulsed. Voldemort was clearly working the spell far more intensely than Lucius had been aiming it at his wife. When he released it, minutes later, Draco was coughing up blood and his body was still convulsing. 

""You were saying, dear boy?"" the Dark Lord tittered. Draco didn't seem able to reply. Voldemort stood and descended the dais to walk around his prone body. ""No matter. Your word is clearly as worthless as you anyway. The youngest Death Eater. The little prodigy, you were supposed to be. Instead you're even more of a failure than your parents. And they have generously agreed for you to pay the price for them as well as yourself. Your life is over, but don't worry, the pain won't end until the Revel is over."" He raised his voice, ""That's a command. He's only to be tortured until the end of the night. I will kill him personally.""

Hermione heard Draco whimpering. He had always been her enemy, but her stomach turned imagining what he was about to endure. She knew from seeing him here and there throughout the battle that his treachery against Lord Voldemort was considerably greater. He had finally let himself be a little selfless and brave and he was going to die for it. But then his father finally stepped forward.

""My Lord,"" he said, dropping to his knees, ""Please, I have no other heir."" Hermione barely stifled a gasp that this was all the man had to say with his son laying there.

Voldemort calmly said, ""You are so amusing, Lucius. Dead men don't need heirs."" At the look on his follower's face, Voldemort began laughing, as he cast a relentless crucio at the man. When it seemed Lucius was incapable of screaming further, the Dark Lord abruptly stopped. ""I don't plan to kill you. Today. You're still useful to me for the moment. You say you need the boy to get a new heir?"" He kicked Draco, who fearfully hadn't moved a muscle during his father's torture, as he mentioned him.

""Yes, my Lord."" Lucius didn't even glance in his son's direction.

""Is there a wife he's been hiding?""

""No, my lord.""

""Hmmm. Then it sounds like he is in need of a wife to be useful for something. My good people,"" Voldemort stepped back onto the dais, ""Does anyone have a daughter they would like to sully with the Malfoy name?""

No one spoke. There was some light laughter. But suddenly Hermione heard a sound behind her. Pansy Parkinson shakily stood, ""I'll marry him."" Draco managed to pull his head up from the floor to stare at her. Hermione couldn't tell what the look in his eyes meant beyond relief that someone was willing. Of course he and Pansy had dated for years, but they had a clear falling out sometime during sixth year. Perhaps that had changed again this past year? 

Lord Voldemort tilted his head. ""A Pureblood princess - one of our own - amongst the prisoners? What travesty is this?""

""There were little kids that nasty werewolf took. From our own House Slytherin. I couldn't just leave them to him."" Pansy gestured behind her to 3 first years and a 2nd year in a trembling cluster behind her. She hastily added, ""my Lord.""

""Are they of noble birth as well?""

""Two are purebloods, the other two,"" her voice shook, ""half. Their families are...not here tonight.""

""What a pity,"" Voldemort said in a bored tone, ""Goyle! Take the two little purebloods to the special guest rooms. Don't forget to obliviate them - they are to know nothing that has happened since the battle."" He didn't even glance at the other two tiny children before turning his attention back to Pansy, ""Now, my dear, back to your potential wedding...Reginald Parkinson!"" he called. A portly man with thick glasses moved up from the back of the room. ""Is this one of your daughters, Parkinson?"" The man glared at her and affirmed that she was. ""Will you give her hand to young Malfoy here? To save him from a terrible fate?""

The man looked irate. ""Of course not! We're purebloods, in good standing. I'll marry her off the first moment I can after this little charade, but she won't be marrying that pitiful chump.""

""Get her out of my sight, then, before she joins him as the entertainment for tonight,"" Voldemort stormed, ""Now. No pureblood woman will have him. However will you get your heir, Lucius?"" He was clearly enjoying this, pacing around the stage as though he were thinking hard about it. But then he paused, turned, and stared straight at the prisoners, straight at HER.

""I know what we'll do. Time for a celebration, my people. Draco Malfoy will be marrying Potter's Mudblood tonight!""

Sunday May 3, 1998; afternoon

Ginny needed to be busy. She wasn't sure what she was going to do, but she had to do something. Dad hadn't left her Mum's bedside since the battle ended. Bill was helping scour the castle and surrounding grounds for the missing, no doubt hoping to find Fleur somewhere - miraculously alive and well. George had locked himself in the dorm room he had once shared with Fred and Lee Jordan and wasn't speaking. Percy was spending all of his time trying to distract Ron. Somehow her family hadn't realized that she was going nearly as crazy as Ron.

She presented herself to Remus, who had grudgingly accepted his role as coordinator for the Order and all who fought on the side of good. The others called him their leader, but Remus certainly didn't see himself that way. Still. He was the one Ginny went to for some sort of assignment. At first, he put her off. Help tend your mother, he said. Then a suggestion to work on keeping Ron distracted. Finally, he told her she could help with the rebuilding efforts, and sent her off to join a team who had begun work on the most damaged part of the castle.

She was shocked when it turned out that this team was led by Seamus Finnegan. She liked him well enough, of course, but he was well known for blowing up everything he touched. It seemed that he was well prepared for her incredulous look. With a sigh, he said, ""Blow things up enough, you finally get good at putting them back together, yeah?""

She began laughing. And then began following his orders. 

They had been working for a couple of hours when they suddenly heard an odd gurgling cough sound. Ginny looked away from the bricks she was levitating back into place while Cho Chang magically mortared them. She gasped. There was a black-cloaked figure coming toward them. Ginny wasn't frightened at the sight of a Death Eater, though. He was barely upright, half dragging himself along. He was deathly pale and covered in blood. It was even matted into his dark, greasy hair. No, Ginny was shocked by the presence of a dead man - Severus Snape.

****************************

Remus was not going to be the head of the Order. That kind of job was for Kingsley, or Minerva if they could find her. He was outraged that she was missing at all. Had they no decency? Of course he already knew the answer to that - had known it for more years than he cared to think about. Losing Professor McGonagall, especially with Dumbledore gone, too, was a terrible blow to everyone's sense of safety. 

Losing two-thirds of their Golden Trio was another terrifying prospect. Madam Pomfrey couldn't figure out quite what was wrong with Harry, but she was hopeful that he would come out of his magical coma at any moment. Remus just feared her ""hope"" was the same desperation the rest of them felt. Harry was the MOST important player in saving the world as they knew it. He had to make it out of this. Remus felt a pang of remorse that his first thought was for Harry's usefulness and not that he needed James' son to be okay. But such was life in the Order. There were too many details to sort - and too much resting on such a tiny contingent of mostly teenagers.

Hermione being among the missing was problematic in a different way. Yes, people were upset. Ron was beside himself. But most importantly, they needed her brilliance. It was not an exaggeration to say that the boys would be long dead without her guiding hand. Even when the three of them had disappeared for months and terrified the elder members of the Order, there had been a certain confidence that Hermione would see them all safe against the odds. But now. She was undoubtedly at Malfoy Manor. There were other dungeons among the Death Eaters, but Remus was confident that she would be in the most secure location. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was staying there, if their last scraps of intelligence were to be believed. And this, at least, he was inclined to believe. Other things....coming from Snivellus? He wasn't so sure he trusted them. And most would be irrelevant now anyway.

Remus sighed as he stared at the stacks of papers before him. There were lists of the dead, lists of the injured, a terribly small list of able bodies and their current assignments, which parts of the castle needed mending, a list of things that needed to be done as soon as they had the manpower. It was never ending. And all Remus really wanted was to take his wife and go home to the baby. He wanted them to curl up together and rest. Instead, he needed to find a way to make the small list of people big enough to cover the huge list of things that must get done. Hogwarts was a fortress, but a very vulnerable one at the moment.

A sound began to make its way to him, even up here in the headmaster's office. Something must be wrong. He wanted to make whoever it was come all the way to him, letting his exhausted mind and body rest just that tiny bit longer, but it could be anything, and it could require his immediate help. Remus sighed and headed out.

*************************************

Saturday, May 3, 1998; late evening

Draco was frozen. This couldn't be happening. In the background, he could hear his father perfecting the art of arguing while groveling. ""...so generous, my Lord Master....but generations of the purest blood....your mercy is boundless, my Lord....her blood is muddy....thank you for this opportunity, my Lord....she stole her magic."" That last bit made Draco want to laugh. He hated everything about Granger, but he knew perfectly well she hadn't stolen her magic. That was a bunch of rubbish for all the mudbloods. But Granger - she hadn't even stolen her place at the top of the class. She was brilliant. It was enraging, but true. 

His mind was wandering. He was still in so much pain that he couldn't focus. He couldn't imagine ever touching any mudblood, especially that one, but given his choices, accepting this marriage was all he could do. Would she accept so easily? She was so bloody stubborn. Not that she had a choice unless he refused. Or his bloody father refused for him. It wouldn't surprise Draco at all to find that his father would rather him dead than producing an heir with less than pure blood, no matter how likely intelligent and powerful that heir might be. Draco blinked. He hadn't meant to think that, but he was smart enough to realize it was true.

""ENOUGH of your drivel, Lucius,"" the Dark Lord finally bellowed. ""Unless you prefer him dead tonight, your pitiful excuse for a son will marry the mudblood now. I like the idea of having her well tied to one of my Death Eaters. We'll need a very special ceremony.""

Bellatrix jumped up next to him, ""My lord, goblin blood rites bind the two together in ways they can't ever get out of!""

""If only I had a goblin handy."" Voldemort sounded irritated with her.

""You do!"" she giggled, ""dear Professor Flitwick is a half-goblin. He used to brag all the time about how extensively he had studied the magic of his heritage. I remember him mentioning how nasty the blood rites are. I think these two deserve nasty.""

""Bring him,"" Voldemort commanded, ""And the mudblood.""

From behind, Draco heard his tiny professor protesting that he would not. He was surprised that he did not hear a word from Granger. He knew they were grabbing and dragging her. He had heard a squeak of indignation, and whoever was getting her grumbling that she wouldn't just stand up and walk. Draco didn't dare look. He knew he was a coward, but he couldn't stand to see what she was thinking on her face when she looked at him. He would be forced to face it soon, but he certainly wasn't going to a moment before it was necessary. 

He suddenly was hit by a body being roughly shoved at him. He was too surprised to reach out to steady her even if he had determined he wanted to, so Hermione fell gracelessly to the ground next to him. The small sound she made as she hit made him wince. He felt an urge to help her up, but this wasn't the time to let such impulses loose. He drew himself up as tall as he could and put on an expression like something foul smelling was nearby, determined not to acknowledge her any other way.

""I won't bind children together with that horrible ritual! And certainly not when one will harm the other. Hermione never needs to blacken her soul with such a disastrous..."" Flitwick was cut off by Granger's voice, softer than Draco had ever heard it, but somehow more powerful as well.

""It's okay, Professor. I'll do it.""

The whole room became silent. Draco's breath caught and he couldn't seem to restart it. What did she just say? WHY would she agree to this? 

Lord Voldemort began to laugh. ""Of course you will, Mudblood. You have no choice in the matter. I am curious, however, why you would agree so easily.""

Her hands were tied in such a way that she couldn't stand alone, but she pulled her body up as much as she could and held her chin high. ""I hate Draco Malfoy with every fiber of my being, but no one deserves to die that way. It's the right thing to do.""

Oh Merlin. Draco's stomach dropped realizing he had become one of Granger's pity projects. His Dark Lord was laughing again.

 

It took very little time for a farce of wedding fanfare to magically transform the room. There were white decorations everywhere with blood red roses as accent pieces here and there. Chairs had been set out in rows, with a pathway down the middle as you would have in any wedding. Lord Voldemort's many followers, those not important enough to be on the chairs of the dais, were happily taking seats out front where they would have a good view of the open space in front of the dais. They would be able to view both the bride and groom AND the horror of the rest of the prisoners trapped off to the side. The followers were chittering, gossiping away, laughter ringing out as they all enjoyed the Malfoys' fall from grace and pretended to be scandalized that he would stoop so low as to marry a mudblood for any reason. 

The dirty, half shredded Muggle clothes Granger had been wearing were replaced with a white wedding dress that hugged her curves at the top then bloomed into a giant princess-type ballgown - beautiful, but Draco knew instinctively that it wasn't her style. It was a stark contrast to her bushy, unbrushed mane and her still-bruised and dirty skin. There were blood red roses in her hair, and weaving themselves downward until a vine wrapped all the way down her left arm. There were thorns along the vine, little rivulets of blood running down where they were digging in and scratching her skin open as she moved. The grimace on her face told Draco that she was in pain but still unwilling to give anyone the satisfaction of making a sound. The thorns undoubtedly did hurt, but of course that was their point. It was all designed to hurt in some way. 

Watching from his spot next to Flitwick, both of them being held in place by someone's magic, Draco felt like crying himself when he looked around at the signs of a supposed celebration and thought about what this really meant for him. How could the purity-loving Dark Lord actually insist that he marry a mudblood?

Up on the dais, Lord Voldemort sat on his throne. The chairs around him were filled. Lucius and Narcissa were given front row seating, as well as Bellatrix and the Lestrange brothers, Yaxley, Dolohov, Nott, and MacNair. The night's privileged and imprisoned have both been chosen for the evening, Draco thought mockingly. They hadn't bothered to change his clothes. Everything he owned was black, expensive, well-tailored. He looked like he was attending his own funeral, which might as well be true.

In further mockery of the whole thing, Flitwick was still in his professor's clothes, torn and dirtied from the battle. He had a table to his right with a blade Draco knew was cursed laying on it. Whatever was done with it would scar forever. He saw that Granger was eyeing it warily. He shuddered at the thought of the scars he knew were on her forearm from its twin. Aunt Bella had been very angry to lose one of the pair. Draco couldn't help but wish they had both gone.

""I think we're all ready, yes?"" Lord Voldemort paused to hear his followers laugh and cheer, ""Goblin, we want a full ceremony. No shirking the vows or full rites. I know precisely what these rituals are meant to do and I want her fully bound to him.""

""Our rituals, brutal though they are, are also quick and to the point. Vows aren't usually bothered with since consent isn't required,"" Professor Flitwick quaked angrily.

""Begin with them anyway. Entertain us."" Everyone laughed again. Everyone except the three Malfoys, the silenced prisoners, and Granger. Draco realized that his parents were still in mortified shock.

Flitwick cleared his throat and began to speak solemnly, a tear rolling down one cheek as he reluctantly spoke, ""Draco Lucius Malfoy and Hermione Jean Granger, do you each take the other to be your wedded partner, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to care for and protect, with magic and without?""

Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but the Dark Lord cut her off. ""What is this goblin? No mention of love? Of forever? We want to be sure these two sweet children make the vows they deserve."" His followers were laughing hysterically. With iron in his voice, he said, ""Try again, Goblin.""

Flitwick looked as though he would refuse, then closed his eyes and gritted his teeth as he repeated the words again, with the required addition, ""Draco Lucius Malfoy and Hermione Jean Granger, do you each take the other to be your wedded partner, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to care for and protect, with magic and without, to love and cherish, forever and always?""

""I do,"" Hermione said, her voice only somewhat shaking. Draco tried to say the same, but he couldn't force the words out. The silence stretched, and he could see the little witch beside him turning her fear and pain into a quiet fury at him. Her eyes came up to seek his, her anger snapping at him through the expressive chocolate depths. He knew he needed to say something, but his brain was suddenly short circuiting and he could barely remember where they were and what they were doing.

Lord Voldemort spoke, ""Do recall, ungrateful child, that the other choice for you is a slow death. Oh, and your mother would suffer along with you. Do you take the vow or not?""

""I do,"" Draco managed, his throat dry and whole body shaking, ""I do take her, always and forever and all that."" Granger was still fuming, but let out the faintest huff of what seemed to be relief.

""Now. Give me your hands - Hermione your left, Draco your right."" Flitwick picked up the cursed knife as he instructed them. He made a small, precise cut on Hermione's palm. She sucked in a breath, but gave no other sign of how it felt. Turning to Draco, the Professor grasped the boy's hand. Draco was confused by the angry gleam in his teacher's eye and the satisfied smirk he was aiming at him. Draco yelped as the little man sliced all the way across his hand. It stung like being hexed and made the flesh around the cut feel burnt. When he jerked away, the cut turned out far more jagged and almost to his wrist. Professor Flitwick chuckled softly as he immediately stuck their wounds together and began chanting.

 

 ""Aeris et in terra
aqua et igni
Sanguinem in sanguinem,
Duo in carne una,
Vita et virtus obligandi, iunctoque volumine millia metretas, ad trahendum simul ut et invenies in perpetuum.
Sanguine meo sanguine: meus es tu.
Sic fiat semper.""

 

Halfway through, the thorny rose vine that had decorated Granger's arm slithered down around their hands to bind them more tightly. Both of them gasped as the thorns dug in. Draco felt his blood tingle, his magic pulse to life, and a pull from deep within toward the girl beside him. He found himself saying, ""Ego tua usque in sempiternum"" with no idea what it even meant. A beat after, he heard her say, ""Vos autem mea in sempiternum."" His sudden awareness of her felt like fire. He had to actively fight his own urge to turn and begin kissing her, reminding himself that this was the mudblood and they were right in front of his Lord and Master.
Suddenly, the rose vine began to glow, and its magic seemed to sink into their skin as the vine itself burned away. He didn't know how Granger felt about it, but Draco was overwhelmed with feeling. He was terrified, still reeling from the battle, achingly aroused, and disgusted by himself at the same time. He couldn't stop quivering, and his fear was exhausting. Draco just wanted to go up to his room, have some firewhiskey, and sleep away the horrors of this day. But also...he now felt a desperate pull to touch the woman beside him, to snog her, shag her until neither of them could move. He had never before felt desire like this.

""I believe this brings us to the fun part, yes?"" The Dark Lord gleefully commented when everything was still for a moment. Flitwick seemed even more upset and angry than before. The Death Eaters and other minions were bubbling over with delighted chatter, and he heard a sob from the dais that he knew was his mother.
""Get on with it, Little Malfoy."" There were snickers all around and Draco was suddenly sure he was not going to like whatever was about to happen.

""M-my Lord, I've married the mudblood as you wished. What would you have me do now?"" Draco was shaking as he said it. How bad would it be? It was always bad. He hated the fear that coursed through his veins. At the same time, the pull he felt to Granger was becoming more overwhelming by the moment. He still hadn't dared look at her. 

""Consummation, child. Do you need an explanation of how it's done?"" There was laughter everywhere, with some rather obscene suggestions shouted from the rows of chairs.  Of course. Draco should have known quite well that would be part of it. A binding like that wouldn't be complete until they were physically joined in every possible way. He closed his eyes for a moment, then held out his arm to her, ""Come with me,"" he said, trying to sound confident, ""What proof would you like, my Lord?""

""You won't need to worry about bringing any proof to us,"" Lord Voldemort smiled, ""Come closer, my friends. There's a show to watch."" Draco felt the blood drain from his face. People began flowing to the front of the room and forming a circle around Draco and Hermione. He felt her go absolutely rigid before finally beginning to behave as he originally expected from her - twisting to escape him, hitting and kicking at him.

""You stay away from me!"" she screamed at him.

He felt a pain deep inside as his own need for her grew but his heart was compelling him to listen to her and stay away. ""Stop trying to fight me,"" he yelled back, wrapping one arm around her waist and one above her breasts so that he could add a whispered ""please"" straight into her ear. ""Don't get us killed now,"" Draco begged, though he instantly felt shame and regret for saying it. Perhaps they would be better off.

Before he could say another word, she kicked backward hard, hitting his shin while also throwing her head back to crack into his. She was suddenly free and running.

The crowd caught her, of course. They were clearly enjoying her fighting against them. 

""Goblin,"" Lord Voldemort barked.

""Yes?"" Flitwick piped with a tone of exhaustion and something a little more rebellious.

""I thought that the blood rite would make them irresistibly drawn to one another. That they wouldn't be able to keep their hands off?""

Flitwick smiled at that, ""Well, some Goblin blood rituals do that.""

The Dark Lord looked livid. Draco felt a jolt of fear for his former professor. ""Avada Kedavra"" Voldemort growled, taking out the tiny professor in one swift swish. Without missing a beat, he turned back to the crowd, ""I think our groom needs his little wife back.""

They started to just fling her back, when Dolohov jumped down from the dais and said, ""Don't give her back to him like that. He won't know what to do with her,"" and ripped the dress off of her shoulders. Someone else grabbed the skirt and tugged. In moments, there were hands everywhere ripping the dress away piece by piece. 

Draco's mind was blank. All he could do was stare at what they were doing, desperate to think of a way to stop it, but just as desperate to see her, to touch her body without that dress. Suddenly his Aunt Bella was beside him, gently pulling off his outer robe, and touching him as inappropriately as she always did, ""Drakey, it's time for you to be undressed, too. We want to see all of you while you fuck the little mudblood into the floor."" Her fingers were tracing down his chest, the nails dragging just enough to make him shudder with revulsion, when he realized that Hermione, with tears streaming down her cheeks, was now completely nude. He was distracted by her gorgeous body, a surprise she had kept wrapped under bulky robes. His aunt sliding downward to undo his trousers brought Draco back to himself with a start. He tried to push her away but she just laughed. He knew no matter how disgusted he was by the wandering hands of his own aunt, he was lucky there weren't more witches on him. A small blessing of being cast so far down by the Dark Lord. No matter how attracted he had been only moments before, how much of a magical pull the blood ritual had just created toward Granger, the reality of what was going on had doused the flame in his body. Jeers from the crowd around them were beginning to overwhelm him when Lord Voldemort stood.

""What is taking so long, little Malfoy?"" Everyone laughed. 

Draco took a shaky breath, ""My Lord, I don't want to do this with an audience like this. She...she belongs to me alone."" Seeing a momentary flash of rage across the Dark Lord's face, he rushed on, a blush covering his entire body, ""Physically, my Lord. I don't think I can. This disgusts me."" He waved his hand vaguely in Hermione's direction. What Draco was truly thinking was that the situation was abhorrent, but he hoped, and was proven correct, that his Lord would accept it as Granger being beneath him.

""Clearly the mudblood is too dirty for our pureblood prince, here. Bella, weren't you just telling me of a new twist you've come up with for the imperius? Something to let the accursed be more aware of what they are doing?""

Bella giggled with delight, ""Oh yes, my Lord. And won't this be a fun way to test it?""

MacNair stepped up, ""Could do a libido potion as well. Apparently the kid needs the help."" Draco felt a deep shame as a potion was passed to the front of the room and shoved in his hand while everyone laughed.

""You will drink it now,"" the Dark Lord commanded. Draco knew that his choices were drinking it or a night of wishing he were dead. He hesitated too long, though, and was suddenly screaming as the Dark Lord hit him with the most powerful crucio he had ever endured. Despite him lifting it far more quickly than usual, Draco was left barely breathing on the ground, unable to stop shaking and moaning. ""Get up, pathetic child, and drink the potion so we can watch you pretend to be a man.""

His aunt looked at him with contempt and chanted in a sing song voice, ""Imperio Conscientia!"" and he truly could NOT do anything but comply. Draco had been imperiused before, but it was nothing like this. This was far stronger than anything he had felt before. His own thoughts and desires, while still there, felt crushed beneath the knowledge that he would cross the circle and begin to fuck the nude woman across from him. He could not resist it. Yet, he wasn't pleasantly zoned out. He didn't have that blissful feeling that he didn't have to worry about anything, just follow orders. 

He wasn't in a haze where he wouldn't know what he had done. Instead, his senses were sharpened. He was hyper aware of everything around him. And....hyper aware of himself, of the emotions he would normally do everything he could to hide. His attraction, that deep pull toward Granger was back and far more intense now. But his disgust was so strong - disgust at the people around him, at the men who had stripped Granger down and were now pawing at her, at his Aunt and her neverending attempts to pet and grope him, but most of all, disgust at himself for what he knew he was about to do. 

Despite his disgust, his fear of the Dark Lord, the embarrassment of people watching, and despite being absolutely certain he wanted nothing to do with this, Draco found his cock growing larger and harder than he could ever remember before. Desire was coursing through his system, both the pull toward her from their binding and the inescapable urges from the potion. His aunt was holding him by the shoulders, holding him back away from the woman his body desired. He was deeply embarrassed that his body wanted to actually thrust, and worse that he couldn't stop himself from doing it. Bellatrix's laugh tickled across his skin.

""Draco, dear, are you feeling desperate for that girl over there?""

He was compelled to answer, and he couldn't deny it.

""Do you want to touch her everywhere and fuck her into the ground?""

He whimpered, but again had to agree.

""Do you want to degrade yourself with her muddy blood?""

""No."" That hadn't changed.

""She's a virgin, you know. Several of the kind gentlemen over there have confirmed it. So you'll be slick from her blood. Does that disgust you?""

""Yes."" Draco felt like throwing up. At least they were both coming into this with no idea of what they were doing, but the way Aunt Bella had phrased it made him sick. And somehow taking Granger's virginity felt so much worse than losing his own. Especially when everyone knew about her but he was still able to keep his status a secret.

Bellatrix walked around in front of him and looked straight into Draco's eyes. ""Are you excited to rape and ravage this nasty mudblood? Your former classmate? Your wife?"" She spat out that last word. 

Draco shuddered. ""No.""

Bella began to cackle. ""Then I guess being aware of what's happening won't be much fun for you. Such a shame, dear. Now. Fuck her brutally. Rape her and make her bleed.""

He could do nothing but comply, no matter how much he didn't want to. He was soon crying nearly as hard as she was, but it didn't stop his body from following Bella's depraved commands.

Monday, May 4, 1998; morning

Draco's head was pounding when he awoke. He felt sore but sated, with an oddly peaceful feeling infusing his entire being. Then he stretched, and realized three things: he was naked, there was dried blood on his body, especially his upper thighs and cock, and he wasn't alone in the bed. His breath was suddenly coming in gasps. He realized with relief that the bed's other occupant was still sleeping. As the sordid memories of what he had done to her came back to him, his self-loathing returned, but also arousal, bringing a whole new wave of revulsion. 

As quickly and quietly as he could, Draco scurried out of the bed. He didn't want to wake her, almost hoped she would never wake up so he didn't have to face her. He rushed to the loo and was sick as quietly as he could manage. When he had nothing left, he moved to the shower, turned the water scalding hot, and vigorously scrubbed the stains off his body. He wished he could scrub the stains on his soul away so easily. Then he chastised himself for thinking such whimsical bullshit. His father was right that he didn't deserve to be called a Malfoy. Of course, his father also bought him just enough time to make an heir before he would be a corpse instead of a Malfoy. 

Draco shuddered - for himself, but also with a fresh wave of shame when he thought of the whole making-an-heir business. With his wife. The one he had brutally raped last night, taking her virginity, and his own, in front of a crowd of rabid Death Eaters. It had been horrible. 

To his continued horror, he found himself rock hard at the slightest thought of her - even the things from last night. The awful things he had been forced to do didn't matter. Making himself think about her dirty blood or how far beneath him she was didn't help. He was married to the swotty, bookworm, Mudblood, one-third of the Golden Trio - a girl he had despised since first year. But none of it mattered. Nothing was making him want her any less. He felt sick again. His vision blurred and in his mind, he saw a slim, shimmering cord of magic from himself and heading out into his bedroom, straight to Granger. His body wanted to follow that line of magic and consummate over and over and over. 

Draco wasn't stupid. He knew this intense desire had to be caused by yesterday's blood rite. Rituals like that often included a physical need for each other for some time after. It didn't make the feelings any less disgusting. As the water ran over his sensitive body, he tried to resolve what to do next. How could he possibly face her? How should he face her? How would the Dark Lord expect him to behave? Them to behave, since Granger would now be expected to perform for him as well. Did he bring her in as an accomplice to the act? Or did he play this off as though he was happy to go along with having her bound to him like some sort of slave? The thought made his blood feel like ice. But. He had been a Slytherin for a reason. His mind was playing through different scenarios and weighing odds when he heard a sound. 

*******************************************

Ron sat on the bed next to Harry's, pretending to play chess with his best friend. Madam Pomfrey said that talking to him might help bring him out, so Ron spoke with a cheerful voice as he asked Harry what move he wanted to make, then discussed whether or not it was a good plan. 

Plans. There should be something beyond this! Ron was trying his hardest to remain calm, but so much was wrong. And so little was being done about it. Professor Lupin, for all that he said he wasn't their leader, was clearly the person in charge. Unfortunately, trying to talk to him about needing to rescue Hermione and the others was like trying to talk to a wall. Lupin would blink at him, sigh, and apologize in that weary tone, but still say no. This last time, he had added that Ron was welcome to offer any plan he had come up with to Kingsley. He would be there in an hour for a meeting.

Ron stared at his chess board. And then slowly began to smile. A plan. If only they knew where the prisoners had been taken, he was sure he could get them out.

****************************************

Hermione woke with a start. She had nearly screamed from her nightmares. Now she barely bit back a scream when she looked down at herself, bruises and blood everywhere, and knew again that last night was real. She was in a luxurious bed, nude, but thankfully alone. She could make an educated guess that she was in Draco Malfoy's bedroom. The furniture was grandiose, but there were a few personal effects that spoke of a young boy's room. Quidditch posters, mostly, though she also noticed a couple of picture frames and could see the platinum blond even from a distance.

As her brain went into overdrive, she realized with surprise that no one had tied her up or done anything to keep her there. Of course, with no wand, and presumably in the middle of the Death Eater headquarters, the odds of slipping out unnoticed were bleak - especially naked, sore, and still bloodied. Hermione shuddered as the thoughts she had been trying to ignore came back full force. She began to gasp for air as the memories rolled over her. She needed a shower and clothes. Immediately. Wrapping the sheet around herself, she decided she was going to find out which door led to a bathroom. As she approached, she could hear water running. It had to be him. Her husband. Her rapist. Logically, she knew he had been a victim, too. Logic wasn't making much impact on her emotions this morning. His body had hurt her so badly. Over and over again. And the people all around them. Hermione couldn't breathe again.     

It was time for her shower. He could bloody well get out. She slammed the bathroom door open and came to an abrupt halt. The boy was standing there, dripping water, having clearly just turned the water off and pulled the curtain open. He hadn't had time to grab a towel yet. Despite the horrors of the night before, that suddenly seemed like a very good thing. With the water sliding down his alabaster skin, he looked like a god, better than a Greek statue, all lean muscle and a raging hard-on. Hermione was too stunned to say a word, certainly not to demand her turn at the shower. Her body responded to the sight of him. She found herself moving closer.

""Granger,"" he choked out, ""I'm so sorry. I..."" He trailed off, seemingly just realizing how displayed he was and how she was looking at him. His entire body flushed pink. She licked her lips and kept walking until her hand reached out and touched his chest. Without saying anything, in a trance, her finger slowly chased a droplet of water downward, across his abs and down the middle of the V at his pelvis. Draco appeared to stop breathing. He was so hard that his cock was standing at full attention and her finger was nearly ready to run along it. Merlin, he wanted that. Hermione wasn't sure how she knew, but she did. Not just intuition, but something far deeper. 

There was a tiny voice in the back of her brain saying things she didn't want to listen to but knew she should. This was just the ritual playing out. There is no way either of them truly wanted this. She should stop it. One of them had to stop it.

""Hermione,"" Draco moaned. She knew he didn't mean it the way it sounded, but their desire was too intense, ""Please...""

She took that as an invitation and changed from the single finger to running her hand along his length. She made a little sound. It was meant to be an affirmation of his moan and the promise that she would continue. It came out as a low and playfully evil chuckle.

If she had been trying for subtle seduction, that sound alone would have wrapped him around her finger. Unfortunately for him and whatever resolve he was trying to fight for, she was not being subtle at all. She now had her hand firmly around his cock dragging slowly up and down and it was pushing him toward an edge he should have been nowhere near. His panting confirmed it. Draco reached for her but she took a step back, pulling his length as she did, then letting it go to stand on its own again. He gasped and then whimpered at the loss of her hand.

""You don't get to touch me without my permission,"" she hissed at him, her voice furious. Her eyes, dark with lust, didn't match the tone. Draco obviously wasn't sure what to do, his hands clenched at his sides. She looked down at them and laughed again, that low, seductive chuckle. ""That's right. Your hands do nothing unless I tell them to."" Her voice was delicious; she could see it in his eyes, feel it quivering through this link they shared. She felt powerful knowing just how deeply this was affecting him.

Staring straight into his eyes, Hermione moved closer to him. So close that her lips touched his chest, right where her finger had first touched. She flicked her tongue out to taste his skin, then slowly began to descend as the water droplet and her finger had done before. Lips and tongue and never breaking eye contact. That last seemed to be what was getting to him the most. Draco quivered with the intensity of this moment. He was clearly desperate to move, to do something to her to take back control. But he didn't dare move his hands. Her eyes still hadn't left his and he couldn't disappoint her.

She sank to her knees as her greedy lips came close to his cock. Draco felt even harder than he had last night on that potion. No. She would not think of last night! Only what was in front of her. Her eyes never left his as her tongue came out and swirled around his tip. He thrust forward helplessly as his hands moved to run through her hair.

Fury surged through her. She licked from the base of his shaft to the tip, then backed up, ripping his hands away from her. The fire in her eyes had shifted from lust to anger, a healthy dose of disgust mixed in. 

""Why would I ever let your hands touch me again, Malfoy? Do you think I've forgotten the things you did to me last night?"" She knew it wasn't his fault. She didn't care right now.

""Merlin, I didn't want to do any of that! I would never...that's...it disgusts me! What happened last night disgusts me."" Draco's tone was frantic.

""Oh yes,"" she cried venemously, ""Of course it disgusts you that you had to fuck a mudblood in front of everyone. How humiliating, right?""

Draco reeled back as though she had physically struck him. Slowly, he said, ""I would never touch a woman who doesn't want it. I might not consider you worthy of a Malfoy, but I...it's not because of your blood.""

She was stunned for a moment. ""Then what the hell would make you think I'm not 'worthy' of you?""

It took him a moment to respond. She knew that he was feeling deeply conflicted and confused. He swallowed hard before repeating one of his father's mantras, ""Malfoys are better than anyone else."" She looked at him incredulously, but he rambled on, ""We're basically wizard royalty. Everyone is below us.""

Hermione stared at him, her lip curling in disgust. ""I need a bath, and a healer, but I'll settle for the first for now,"" she said, ""Get out.""

Draco didn't argue, rushing out with a final projected feeling of relief. With him out of the room, she was suddenly deeply embarrassed by the way she had reacted to his body. How could she want to touch him, even to take control, after everything? 

***********************************************

The hospital ward was chaos once again. This time, though, it had only taken a single person to throw it into such a crazed state. 

Severus Snape had been listed among the dead. Ron had been certain of it, personally saw him take his last breath after Nagini attacked him. Later, Harry had briefly told Ron and Hermione some tripe about Snape being a hero, something about watching the memories Snape gave him, but that was all he got before the final push of the battle played out. 

Good or bad, the man was now laying in the ward while Madam Pomfrey rushed around trying to stabilize him. All of her usual helpers were among the wounded, missing, or dead, so it was an overwhelming task. ""You!"" she shouted at Ron, ""Get me two blood replenishing potions and Skelegro. The snake venom has nearly melted through some of his bones. I'll have to vanish them and let them regrow."" Ron shuddered at that thought as he rushed to the cabinet where potions were kept.  

Nearby, Lupin and Shacklebolt were arguing whether the man should be kept up here or down in the dungeons. The building crew that found him was still there. Seamus Finnegan was screaming that they should finish him off instead of healing him. Dean Thomas was having a hard time holding him back. Ginny had been the one who insisted they bring him to Madam Pomfrey, and had floated him all the way from the grounds to ensure he made it there. The rest of Ron's family had already been in the hospital wing, gathered around Molly and Harry's beds. Arthur, Bill, and Percy were standing protectively around their loved ones since the moment they saw who was being brought in. Ron had been with them at first. Now it seemed he would be helping.

""Will he be ok?"" Ginny asked Madam Pomfrey. 

The older woman huffed and looked irritated as she worked. ""It has taken him almost two days to make it to the castle. He must have had some sort of antidote, but that snake has the strongest venom I have ever heard of. There is no way to know if he will survive.""

Ron couldn't help but speak up, ""Why do you care about the traitorous git getting better, Gin? Why do any of us?"" He looked skeptically at the potions in his own hands as he slowed to a walk. 

""He's a potions master, Ron! And he was a double agent for years. He may know something to bring Harry back! Or Mum! Might have information that will help us find Hermione and Charlie,"" his sister gritted out. 

Ron realized he should have put that together himself. He quickened his steps to Madam Pomfrey and handed over the things she had requested. As she whispered the spells to make Snape drink down the potions, his eyes snapped open. 

""McGonagall,"" he growled, after swallowing the last bit.

""She's been taken,"" Pomfry said matter-of-factly. 

Snape looked extremely distressed. ""Potter,"" he managed.

Lupin suddenly bounded over from his conversation with Shacklebolt and snarled, ""What do you want with the boy?""

Snape sent his old enemy a withering glare. ""Gave him...memories.""

Ginny seemed to understand what he meant before anyone else. ""Harry can't tell us about any memories right now. He's been unconscious since the battle. We need help bringing him out of it.""

""Ginny!"" Lupin, Shacklebolt, and Mr. Weasley cried together. ""That's more than he needs to know,"" Shacklebolt ground out with finality.

""No."" Ginny defied, ""Ron told me Harry said something mental about Snape being one of us after all. I bet there's something in those memories that we don't know about. And we have to have Harry back! It doesn't matter which side Professor Snape was on before."" Her look became steely, ""If he wants us to help him get better, he will help Harry.""

The adults looked shocked for a moment, then Lupin began to nod. ""That makes sense. Once Harry is awake, he could tell us what Snape shared with him and we'll better know what to do with him.""

Madam Pomfrey had had enough. ""He won't be helping anyone if you don't all get back and let me finish working on him. Then he'll need rest. Out of my ward, the lot of you!""

""Wait,"" came the commanding tone of Professor Snape. ""Malfoy Manor. You must save the ones taken."" His voice weakened as he spoke, passing out before he could say another word.

Malfoy Manor. Ron knew exactly how to make his plan work.

************************************************

Draco was relieved to be out of the bathroom, away from Hermione. He couldn't believe the way she had touched him - or how his body still burned for more. His mind was spinning trying to push back the lust and lure to her. She needed a healer. Merlin, what had he done to her? He knew what he had done, but he didn't want to imagine what the damage actually looked like, what it was or where exactly. 

""Mimsy,"" he called. A small elf wearing a clean but heavily-mended pillowcase appeared.

""Mimsy is here, Master Draco, sir. What would he be having Mimsy do?"" There was disapproval in her voice, as though she expected to dislike his orders.

Draco sighed, knowing how disappointed she was in him. ""I just need Healer Zabini, Mimsy. Please bring him here.""

Her fists landed on her hips. ""Did Master Draco get hurt again? Where? Mimsy not be seeing it,"" she scolded.

""It's not for me. It's for my w...a woman who needs help.""

Mimsy gave a little squeal. ""Oh, the new Mistress! You be calling her what she is, Master Draco! You hurts her, I hears. Theys talk about it all over. Mimsy get Mister Blaise for Mistress.""

With that the little elf popped away. Draco dropped onto the bed and put his head in his hands. The crushing guilt was weighing him down. More than just that, though - what was he supposed to do with a wife, especially one who hated him? And who he would need to protect. Last night had been horrific, and he knew his master well enough to know the evil creature wouldn't let that be the only incident of using her for entertainment. Using them for entertainment. What would he do? He was still sitting there on the bed when Mimsy returned with his old friend. 

She immediately walked around the room straightening and with a snap of her fingers changed the bloody sheets. Shaking her head, she said, ""I just be greeting the new Mistress and help her. You make him good, Mister Blaise,"" she said before disappearing into the bathroom.

Blaise sat down next to Draco. They heard a small squeal from the other room. It was a moment before he spoke. ""Granger, eh? Never thought we would see you get to live out that little fantasy.""

Draco jerked his head up to meet his friend's eyes, ""What?""

""Come on now. We all know you secretly fancied her. But all the blood stuff..."" Blaise let out a sharp bark of a laugh. ""Then Lord Pureblood Supremacy marries you off to the biggest mudblood in our world.""

""Shut it, Blaise!"" Draco said in a frantic whisper, ""You're too careless. Of course I didn't fancy her. And you can't make fun of the Dark Lord like that!""

""Draco, Theo warded this room himself. It's probably the safest place in the whole manor. You know I'm not afraid to talk plainly here.""

""He hasn't been able to come up and strengthen things in a couple of weeks, Blaise. They're keeping him on double guard rotation, and now handling the prisoners, too. He looked ill the last time I saw him. Thank Merlin they don't know how talented he is or he would never be allowed sleep.""

""Ha! They would have him chained to Bellatrix...or maybe the damn snake...if they knew everything he's capable of. It's ludicrous that they think he's just a common guard.""

""It's lucky they believe he's the useless sod his father thinks he is.""

""Lucky for us,"" Blaise laughed, as he did some diagnostics around the room, ""You're awful at even maintaining what he does.""

Draco gave a grunt of irritation. ""I told you to mind your mouth for a reason."" He stood and offered his own magic to Blaise as his friend shored up the complicated wards. They worked together for a few moments before Draco spoke again. ""He really is lucky, you know.""

""I do,"" Blaise agreed quietly. ""So am I. I'm sorry you have to go through this kind of thing, mate. Last night was...""

""Don't,"" Draco sighed. ""It was worse for her anyway. Blaise, she needs healing. I don't know quite what...I...I did something to her down there, I think. There was blood all over both of us when we woke up.""

""I'm not surprised, but had hoped it might not be so bad."" Blaise looked concerned. If he noticed the way Draco's skin had blushed pink while he stumbled over what had to be said, he didn't comment. Instead, he stood from the bed and began walking toward the bathroom. He paused before he got to the door, ""Draco. I think it might be best if you go take care of some Death Eater business, don't you? Something outside your rooms?""

 

*************************************

There was a knock on the door that stopped Hermione in the midst of her argument with the stubborn little elf. She had been terrified when the elf popped in unannounced and introduced herself. Soon, though, she had found herself frustrated. Of course she didn't want to upset her, and it did seem like Mimsy meant well, but she was also insistent that Hermione get out of the tub, let her dry her off, and that she only wear a robe to see the healer 'Master Draco' had brought. She wasn't the least bit interested in being freed or paid, either. Hermione found the whole thing irritating, though she had to admit that Mimsy clearly shared her opinion of the maddening nature of their conversation. 

Despite being in only the robe - as Mimsy had insisted - Hermione was in enough pain that she was relieved by the arrival of the healer - until she realized she knew him. 

""Zabini!"" she gasped.

""Healer Zabini, these days, my lady,"" he said with a gracious bow. Even so, Hermione was backing away from him as she clutched at the robe. He stayed where he was and raised both hands in a surrendering gesture; his wand wasn't even out. His rich, low voice soothed, ""I'm not here to hurt you.""

Hermione felt her knees buckling as she collided with the wall as far from him as she could get. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't think past the spinning in her mind. 

""Young Mistress!"" she heard the little elf cry in distress and felt the withered little hand patting her own, ""Master Draco only trust Mister Blaise. They has always been friends. Mimsy changed theys diapeys together. Mister Blaise bestest healer. Hims always...""

Blaise cut in over the elf, ""Mimsy. Let me talk to my patient, please. Stay with us."" He turned his attention back to Hermione and let his voice slow down so that it felt like it was rolling smoothly over her, as calming as a balm might be. ""Granger, you aren't alone with me. Mimsy is staying. She's right here. I'm told you are hurt more than Malfoy would be able to fix, probably some internal damage I imagine. First I'm going to stay right here and do a diagnostic. I'll be using my wand.""His tone had calmed her enough that she didn't scream when he slowly brought his wand up and pointed it at her, but she did begin shaking and her breathing was quite beyond her control as it sped off again. 

""Deep breath, love,"" he muttered distractedly. Hermione took a couple of deep gulps for air and tried to study the magical symbols dancing above her. Unfortunately they didn't mean anything to her. The worried look in his eyes was telling her, though, that the news was not good. After a moment, he looked directly into her eyes, ""Granger...Hermione...you have to be in terrible pain right now."" 

She whimpered in response, trying to hold back a sob as he took half a step toward her. His voice was still low and smooth, but it took on a more urgent tone. ""There are internal tears and bleeding. I'm afraid they're getting worse with your heart sped up like this and standing as you are. Come on, love, you have to let me near enough to heal you.""

She shook her head as tears overflowed down her cheeks. Everything did hurt, and the pain was much worse since she left the tub, but Hermione couldn't stand the thought of a man's hands on her. Some background part of her brain pointed out that not even an hour ago she had been running her hands over Draco Malfoy's nude body and now she couldn't cope with the idea of a male healer helping her. Yes, he was a Slytherin, but Blaise Zabini had never said anything himself or even egged Malfoy on much. Relatively speaking, she had far more reason to trust him than Malfoy. Her sobs became a little bit giggly and she realized she was sliding toward hysteria.

Zabini and Mimsy exchanged a concerned look. He turned to rummage through a healer's bag she hadn't noticed him bring in. He handed a potion vial to Mimsy. ""Granger. This is a calming draught. Please just take it so I can help you, love.""

She shook her head when Mimsy got near her with it. The older elf gave an exasperated sigh. ""Yous be taking this young Mistress. Mister Blaise musts be healing you now."" Her little hands wrapped around Hermione's wrist with a strength she wouldn't have imagined and shoved the potion into her mouth. Hermione started to fight, but almost instantly was hit by the scent and soothing taste of the calming draught. She sighed contentedly and let her legs slide her down the wall...leaving a trail of blood on the wall and starting to pool between her legs. 

Blaise made a startled sound and leapt forward to be by her side, muttering about stubborn fools. He laid her all the way down on the floor. He nodded to Mimsy and she gently held Hermione's top half down while he parted her robe and began some fancy wandwork down below. He rambled while he worked, his voice not quite as smooth and soothing, no longer meant for a frightened animal, but still low and reassuring, ""That was a rough bit there, love. It should feel better in just a moment. I don't blame you for being so scared, Granger. I wouldn't let anyone near me after that either. I'm sorry I'm not of the girly persuasion. Might have made this a bit easier. That lousy git calling me a bit sooner might have made this easier, too. Though Salazar knows how much worse it might be with that arsehole in the room.""

Hermione had been letting his words roll over her along with the waves of calm from the potion, but she giggled distantly at that. Blaise paused his rambling to raise an eyebrow at her. Before she could stop herself, she found her tongue dribbling out the story of their encounter this morning, giggling through it all. That distant part of her brain was now wondering how strong that calming draught had been as she had clearly lost her mind. And lost it so thoroughly that she had brought the verbose healer to a moment of utter speechlessness. 

It was Mimsy who broke the silence. ""Young Mistress and Master is still blood-bound. Blood rites is strong.""

""Of course,"" Blaise agreed, ""I've never seen goblin blood rituals performed before, but they're supposed to be wickedly strong on humans. Now. You're healed, but you need rest. Here's a Dreamless Sleep potion. That's a good girl, love."" She was already falling asleep as he scooped her up and tucked her back into Malfoy's bed.

Trigger Warnings: mentions of violence and rape, though none takes place in this chapter

Monday, May 4, 1998; late afternoon

Hermione woke to the hushed sounds of two low voices rumbling back and forth at one another. Her brain felt a little fuzzy for a moment before snapping to attention. One of the voices was undoubtedly the soothing tones of Zabini. The other voice was intensely familiar and simply hearing it shot a pulse of heat straight through her. She barely bit back a moan, deciding to see what they were talking about before letting anyone know she was awake.

""...his own business! My fucking father had to keep bitching about me marrying a damn mudblood and how awful it is and now....NOW they're saying tonight's entertainment will be to show us that not everyone would mind fucking the mudblood. What the fuck does that mean, Blaise?!"" He sounded like he was hyperventilating.

""Whatever it means, you're not going to be ready to face it if you can't calm down."" Zabini sounded nearly as worked up as Malfoy, but trying to keep a soothing healer voice anyway. 

""Calm down!? How? The dark lord is still furious at my entire family. He tortured Dolohov last night and made it clear that it was Mother's fault. Father dueled him earlier but you know that's not the end of it. Mother is barely able to stand after everything she went through last night. The dungeons of my childhood home are filled with people I know. The hallways of my home are filled with monsters I wish I didn't know. My best friends are all trapped here on my account. I've got a mudblood wife who nearly bled out earlier because she's so afraid - thanks to me - that she couldn't let the healer touch her. And I can't think straight because, thanks to that stupid ritual, all the blood that should be in my head is in my cock wanting to slam that little swot into the bed or the wall or wherever I can catch her and fuck her until we both pass out."" Malfoy was panting at the end of his tirade. 

Hermione shuddered slightly hearing Malfoy so bluntly describe what he wanted to do to her, but she honestly couldn't say if it was because of how much it terrified her or how much she also wanted it. The level of Malfoy's panic over everything else made her very worried. Zabini's reaction doubled her anxiety.

Zabini spoke then, ""Malfoy. This isn't the first time everything has been shit. Theo and I won't abandon you here. Your mother and father went through an entire war before this one. They'll make it through this one too. Granger...I don't know what to say about her. If she's still just a 'mudblood' to you, why do you care so much?""

There was silence. Hermione almost sat up to see what he was doing, how he was reacting, but he finally began sputtering inelegantly.

""She's my wife, Blaise. Forever. This bloody intense attraction won't last - I hope - but the marriage isn't going away. So even if I hate her, I have to protect her.""

""Do you?"" Zabini's low, rich voice rolled out.

""Do I what?"" Draco responded with a tone of exasperated confusion.

""Do you hate her?"" 

Hermione almost gasped at the blunt question, straining her ears waiting for his reply.

""Of....of course I do. What kind of question is that?"" Draco hissed. 

Blaise sighed. ""I just wasn't sure if you had decided she was a person or if she's still just Potter's mudblood to you.""

""Mine,"" Draco snapped.

""What?"" his old friend asked.

""She doesn't belong to Potter,"" Draco said, sounding nearly feral in his irritation, ""She belongs to me now."" 

Hermione spoke before she remembered she was supposed to be listening quietly, ""I'll have you know, Malfoy, I belong to no one but myself! Not Harry. Not you."" She sat up and almost let the sheet fall from her body before realizing she was only wearing a half untied robe with nothing underneath. ""If I was going to belong to someone, it certainly wouldn't be a pompous git who thinks I'm nothing more than a mudblood!"" She was furious.

The two boys were staring at her. Draco's grey eyes were huge for a moment before sliding into an icy neutral look. He stuck out his pointy chin and decorated his face with that familiar sneer. 

""You do belong to me and you'll learn not to talk back."" He sounded almost as angry as she felt.

""What are you going to do about it when I do, Draco Malfoy?""

""Maybe you've forgotten, but you don't have a wand."" He pointed out, ""So I'll do whatever I want to do to you.""

""Like you did last night?"" she growled. 

His face went ghostly white. Blaise looked like he was about to say something when Draco suddenly went flying toward the wall on the other side of the room as Granger continued; 

""I may not have a wand, but I'm not defenseless. You would do well to remember that, ferret. I don't know why you think you would be qualified, but I don't need you to protect me either.""

""Yes you bloody well do,"" Draco fumed, even with fear in his eyes as he tried to push himself off the wall and stand. Then, with his cheeks flushing, he asked, ""How long have you been listening?""

She paused, calculating whether or not she was willing to give him that information. This whole argument needed to be refocused on more important topics. ""Long enough to know that they have something planned for us tonight and we need to figure out what to do about it.""

Hermione could tell from the look that passed between the two boys that they were shocked by how long she had been listening and trying to mentally recount everything they had said in that time. 

It was Blaise who spoke first; ""That is the most pressing issue right now. Draco, we don't know what they meant when they said they would show your father how much others want the mudblood.""

""But I think we can safely surmise it means I'm up for grabs this evening,"" Hermione said far more calmly than she felt.

""No,"" Draco growled.

Blaise shook his head, ""I have to agree with her, mate. They're going to bank on you being a spoiled brat and demanding she belong only to you."" He was pacing now. ""Fuck. They may even be planning to finish last night for you. For both of you.""

""Finish as in kill us?"" Hermione asked, a little less calmly.

""No,"" Draco said again, ""Not her anyway. She's too valuable as a prisoner.""

""You may have a point,"" Blaise conceded, ""Though they would probably be happy to finish her night the same way as last, just with crowd participation. You know there were many who wanted a piece of her last night.""

""I'm right here,"" Hermione said, her voice trembling, ""I follow your logic, but you won't talk about me like I'm not a part of this conversation.""

""I'm not sure I want you to be part of the conversation,"" Draco whined, ""You're just a mudblood. I should be treating you as I always have.""

""Don't give me that tripe,"" Hermione scoffed. ""I heard what you were saying to Blaise, remember? You didn't spell it out, but you clearly don't look down on my blood status the same way you used to.""

Draco squirmed uncomfortably. He looked about ready to give a haughty retort when Blaise's hand landed on his shoulder, ""Just stop. We need to figure out how you're going to play this tonight.""

""I have an idea,"" Hermione stated. When she had their full attention, she continued. ""Malfoy should continue to treat me as he always has when we're in front of the Dark Lord. He'll likely find some reason to punish us anyway, but it needn't be because we're getting along. When he suggests giving me to others, Malfoy acts the brat, but gives the excuse that he can't be sure a potential heir is his if I'm given over to the crowd. That was supposedly the reason for our union.""

""He's barking mad, Granger, nuttier than an oak,"" Draco whispered, his voice so low she could barely hear it, ""He won't care what he did last night or why.""

She paused a moment. ""Do you have a better idea?""

He looked defeated as he said, ""No.""

************************************

Ginny was baking a pie. A number of pies, actually. She was using one of Molly's recipes, but she had never baked one herself. The first 16 had been abysmal failures. But there was a meeting in a little while and Molly always provided pies for the meeting. The house elves had offered to do pies themselves, even use her Mum's recipe, but Ginny couldn't stand it. Harry always looked forward to the pies. She knew her brothers, the ones left, needed that pick-me-up. And what else would she do? 

While parts of the castle were still in shambles, acting-Headmistress Sprout had been consulting with Dumbledore's portrait and some various texts from the founders, passed down through generations of Headmasters, and discovered that they needed to be building complicated wards into the walls as they went. The ancient magic was going to be hard to put together. Sprout wasn't entirely sure there was anyone present at Hogwarts with enough power to perform the spells necessary, even if they could figure out quite what they were. She had declared herself unfit, bemoaning the loss of McGonagall.

Ginny thought they should talk to her brother, Bill, but he was a mess and busying himself with Ron today so she hadn't had the heart to suggest it yet. Besides, it was time for the pies. Mum always said the most important ingredient was love, so Ginny tried her hardest to fill them with love. She felt like she was drowning in all the extra love she wanted to give to Fred, Charlie, and Mum with nowhere for it to go, so she had plenty to spare. Perhaps it might have made the pies delicious like Mum's, but it was hard to tell when she either burnt or undercooked them every single time. 

She huffed. Just through trial and error she should have gotten a few right by now. Perhaps there was a way to communicate love to the order members through her Quidditch skills instead. Baking was clearly not her strong point. But neither was giving up. 

********************************************

The entire order was assembled for the first time since the battle. It was frightening to see how few of them there really were now, but heartening to be together and know that they were all determined. They had even tackled Ginny's pies together, and some people had managed to choke some down. Ron felt good about that much. His sister was struggling badly and while he thought she was barmy for picking that as her project, he understood the need to push emotions into a project. He was just glad that his project might be a little more useful than hers. All he had to do was get the order to approve and move on it.

Convincing the older contingent was turning out to be far more complicated than Ron had expected. They deferred to Harry, but they just looked at him and saw a funny sidekick. His plan was sound, but it needed to be executed immediately if they wanted anything to be left to rescue. They had too many high profile prisoners and Kingsley and Lupin didn't want to risk something happening to them.

""They'll try to ransom them to us before long. Or trade for something or someone. Attacking such a heavily guarded estate is foolhardy at best."" Kingsley stated in a way that brooked no argument.

""What if they don't?"" Ron fumed. He was surprised when his eldest brother, Bill, also spoke up, ""Why would we give them anything when we could take our people back with Ron's plan?""

Kingsley and Lupin looked at Bill like he had betrayed them. Bill returned the look. Ron knew he was desperate to save Fleur and Charlie. His need to save his wife was almost savage. He had been tearing around the castle like a crazed animal trying to stay busy. And Charlie. They had always been close. Doing nothing about all this was killing him. 

When they didn't say anything, Bill growled, ""This is a solid plan. If one of you had thought of it instead of one of the kids, we would already be at Malfoy Manor. I would take Ron and do it ourselves, but his plan is the safer bet.""

""I would come even with just the two of you,"" Lee Jordan volunteered.

""Oi. Me as well,"" said George, followed by a chorus from almost every surviving member of the DA.

Bill looked around with a feral grin. ""I think the kids outnumber you old folks, and they're ready and willing to fight.""

""They're brave Bill, but you need more numbers if you're going to pull this off,"" Lupin said. He sounded tired.

""I won't have it!"" Kingsley shouted. ""We've lost too many people already and I'm not convinced you can get them out.""

""We've got too many people dying inside that manor!"" Ron slammed his fist on the table; he was tired of arguing about it. 

""We don't know that any of them are dying,"" Lupin quietly corrected.

""We know they're at least being tortured and that's enough to get them out of there. Even if they all survive, they could be more damaged by the moment. We should go now.""

A silence filled the room.

""Without proper planning, it would be a disaster,"" Kingsley spoke gravely.

Lupin held up his hands, ""Kingsley. The kids are right this time. This plan can work, and it's better done with the Aurors and other experienced members than if they go alone."" A cheer went up. ""BUT!"" he called over them, ""we do need planning time. We will arrange the mission. Be ready to go tomorrow evening. Night will make the disillusionment charms more effective.""

Ron grinned in triumph. By this time tomorrow, he would have Hermione back. He just had to focus for now. Bill was waving him closer to himself, Remus, and Kingsley, so Ron swiftly joined them.

""Getting past the wards will be the hardest part...""

The characters and such still belong to JK Rowling, most unfortunately.

Monday, May 4, 1998; late evening

Draco was sweating and scared, but he was surprised by how well the evening had gone so far. Of course, the Dark Lord had indeed intended that Hermione be used by all during tonight's entertainment. It wasn't quite a revel since they were the only planned show for the night.

There had been some minor business to attend to first; the Dark Lord had been so pleased with his crazy aunt's ideas the night before that he was giving her Longbottom to torture into oblivion and the Weasel brother as a toy. This had caused some grumbling as no one else received two prisoners, but there wasn't anyone willing to openly challenge their Lord's second-in-command. McGonagall had been given to Crabbe's wife as a maid - consolation for the death of their son. The other prisoners were being transferred to a different location.

Now it was their turn. Draco had done a stupendous job playing his part; he had been every inch the spoiled, arrogant git he needed to be, but he thought he was getting through to them with his argument. There really was no way to ensure his heir if the entirety of the Death Eaters had her tonight. 

Lord Voldemort threw back his head and laughed, ""Dead men don't need heirs.""

He had used the line on his father the night before, but Draco had the feeling it wasn't a joke this time.

""Or pretty wives who deserve to be used by every man here,"" he added. 

""Fine,"" Draco said, voice shaking. ""Fine, but if I'm to die, let me duel anyone who wishes to take her from me until..."" he swallowed hard, ""until I go down.""

""Hmmm,"" the Dark Lord hummed as he observed Draco for a moment. ""You've grown fond of the little mudblood. How cute.""

Draco did his best to steady his voice, ""We're blood-bound; I must protect her. And our child, whether conceived or yet to be, is precious to me."" Draco was surprised by how true these statements really were. He didn't know if the bond was soul deep or not, but he felt like he would regret it forever if he didn't save her, no matter what happened to him. It was stronger even than the urge to touch her.

Lord Voldemort looked around and sighed. ""I do think some dueling might be fun to watch. Do understand, dear boy, that once you are disposed of, I will allow the others to have their way with her.

Draco turned almost red with rage. ""And if I live through it?"" he bit out. 

""If you can make it through 3 challengers, I will allow you to return to your chambers and fuck her privately. We can do this every evening until you die. Doesn't that sound fun?"" he chuckled dryly.

There was a smattering of applause before the Dark Lord asked for tonight's 3 challengers. Greyback. Dolohov. Rowle. The only thing that could have made it worse would have been his mad Uncle Lestrange joining the party.

Of course he was wrong. The three challengers stepped up, drawing their wands in sync, clearly planning to take him together. That was worse. There was a movement behind him; Yaxley and Macnair threw Hermione roughly to the ground, bound and helpless. She had no wand. She was wearing a slip of a dress that barely covered her bum, and a tiny thong beneath it. 

""It will be motivating for everyone to keep the prize in mind, don't you think?"" the Dark Lord commented.

Draco gave a tight nod as his three challengers leered. Now he had her to protect as well. 

""There will be no killing curses thrown,"" Lord Voldemort commanded. ""When he goes down, we will let him watch what becomes of his wife before I torture and kill him myself.""

Draco shuddered; he had always been a bit of a coward. The Gryffindors weren't the only ones who thought so; the Death Eaters branded him the same - only their reasoning was that he never killed anyone and did his solid best to avoid torturing. He threw mean hexes, sure, but never the worst ones. He wouldn't learn how to turn someone's organs inside out or how to vanish the skin. He had a carefully cultivated reputation for being squeamish about body things, going so far as to whine and carry on after battles when people were scratched up or worse. He had been known to faint if there was enough blood: whatever he had to do to avoid learning the worst things you could do to another human. Draco knew he wasn't a coward; he was a survivor. Until today, everything he had done was for his, and his mother's, ultimate survival. He was a good duelist, one of the best if you left out the terrifying horror spells, but it was certainly not a survivor's move to duel three of the fastest, cruelest Death Eaters at once.

Lord Voldemort clapped his hands and the ballroom floor became something of an arena. Lucius and Narcissa had been given front row seats to ensure they didn't miss any of it. Narcissa looked like she might pass out from fear. Lucius had a sneer plastered on his face. The rest of his followers gathered around the sides, shouting in anticipation. 

There was no warning before Rowle threw the first stunner. Draco dodged and sent one back. He threw up a shield before a shot of yellow light from Dolohov could hit him. He wasn't sure which spell it was, but was certain that it was one he had been trying to avoid. The nastiest spells were Dolohov's favorite. He lobbed an Expelliarmus at the bastard; it wasn't his favorite spell, but Dolohov without a wand was considerably less terrifying. Predictably, Dolohov dodged it with a laugh, but it unexpectedly hit Greyback before he could get out his first spell. The wolf howled angrily as Draco tossed the wand as close as he could get to Granger. It was probably fruitless, given she was tied up, but he knew better than to underestimate her. 

The moment of dealing with the wand was a mistake, however. Rowle hit him with a slicing hex to his left shoulder. Draco gasped from the pain but was thankful it wasn't his wand arm. An additional slice hit his right leg. Before he could react, there was another sickening yellow light coming at him from Dolohov. He barely got a shield up, a weak one at that. He could hear the man laughing through the ringing in his ears. A volley of yellow spells came at him at the same time he saw Greyback barreling toward him -- having thrown away all dueling etiquette. Suddenly, he was faced with an impossible choice -- did he stop the werewolf from physically attacking or try to erect a stronger shield to counter the barrage of spells? He threw everything he had into a shield and braced himself as best he could physically. 

Before Greyback could reach him, the wolf was thrown back. Draco knew it had to be Granger. His energy was giving out and he wouldn't have been able to throw two spells at once. He was a good duelist; he wasn't good enough for this. He had no choice but to try his hardest, but it was only a matter of time.

Rowle threw a Sectumsempra at the same time Dolohov threw Remotionem Pulmonem, and Draco's shield began to fail as they laughed and chanted their next spells. He sent an easily dodged stunner at Dolohov as he realized Greyback was back up and running towards him again. 

As the next set of spells hit his shield, it began to crumble. Something hit his stomach and he began retching as he felt blood everywhere. Draco's head was spinning as he was surrounded by the light of a powerful shield. Greyback was thrown back again, this time crumpling into a heap. Draco fought to stand straight, his left arm cradling the pain in his middle. He needed more energy, more power. But there was nothing, he had nothing left. He dropped to his knees, narrowly avoiding two more oncoming spells. Then, as though reminding him it was there, he felt a sparkling tingle along the invisible thread that connected him to Granger. A shimmer of energy coursed along the thread. It felt like a tidal wave of power overwhelming him with its need to burst out.

With a scream, Draco stood and discharged a volley of spells: Confrigo, Incendio, Stupefy, Expelliarmus. At the end, both Rowle and Dolohov lay on the ground, unconscious. Turning, he freed Granger from the binds that had held her in place. Completely spent, the surge of power gone, he fell back to his knees, barely keeping his upper body from collapsing as well. If he went down now, it would all have been for nothing. The room was completely silent, the gathered Death Eaters still making sense of what had happened.

Hermione rushed to him, scooping up Greyback's wand on her way. She cast several quick healing spells on him before anyone could stop her. Voldemort stood, furious, and the wand jerked out of her hand to fly to him. 

""What did you do?"" the Dark Lord fumed. Hermione screamed as he hit her with a Crucio. 

When she recovered, she called with a steady voice, ""You said he could take me back to the room to rape me alone if he won."" Her voice was bitter, especially on the word ""rape,"" but quivered when she got to alone. Draco was amazed she could sound so calm after everything that had just happened. He only hoped it was enough to get them out of there. The bleeding had slowed, but he needed real healing. 

The Dark Lord laughed, ""Am I to believe he has the fortitude to take you tonight? That was quite a display. I doubt he'll have any magic left until his core rests, and I suspect you're a handful even without a wand. Perhaps it would be best for a few others to take over.""

""No,"" Draco gritted out, ""I will fulfill my duties. I want my baby in her belly as soon as possible. And the bonding magic is more insistent than exhaustion."" His face was gray and his breathing ragged, but he pulled himself to stand. 

There were a few beats of silence before Voldemort replied. ""Very well. Healer Zabini! Your classmate here has put on a good show tonight. Perhaps he has more promise than I imagined. Do heal him up so that he can properly force his beautiful bride.""

""Thank you, my Lord,"" Draco said, forcing reverence into his tone, and managing a small bow of deference.

""You will be expected for training tomorrow, Malfoy. You will begin working with your aunt on some of the more complex spells you've been avoiding.""

He nodded, though his complexion blanched even further at those words. With Hermione trailing demurely behind him, Draco left the ballroom with all the aristocratic grace he could manage, Zabini hustling after him. 

*********************************************

Hours passed before Narcissa was allowed to leave the hall. She practically ran when she was finally released. Part of her wanted to scream at her husband as Lucius chose to laugh and carry on with his fellows instead of checking on their son. She couldn't tell anymore if he just trusted her to take care of it or if he was truly so uninterested in their boy that he couldn't be bothered. 

She burst in the room to find Draco propped against the headboard of his bed. He was paler than usual, with bandages around his stomach and a sling holding his left arm in place, presumably to keep his wrapped shoulder stabilized. Narcissa barely spared a glance for the other occupants of the room. 

""Draco, my sweet son! How are you feeling, darling?"" she cried.

""I'm fine, mother. Don't fret. You know Blaise takes good care of me. He fixed me up.""

""Of course he did,"" she replied, looking fondly at the other boy. She then scowled a bit when her eyes took in the mudblood girl, wearing a robe over her tiny dress, with a book in her hand. She started to say something when her son's old nursemaid elf spoke, ""Mistress Cissy, I has our boys in hand. Yous trust old Mimsy to take care.""

""I do, of course, Mimsy,"" she said with irritation, ""But I needed to see him well before I might sleep tonight."" Looking him over sharply, she continued, ""Blaise, why are there bandages? Why isn't he fully healed?""

Blaise looked uncomfortable, but responded quickly, his low voice rolling out with the calming measured tone he always used when healing, ""Draco's magic is far overextended, Narcissa. While the healing spells come from me, a person's magic responds to bring about the body's healing. He is so depleted at the moment that he doesn't have enough magic to meet mine. He's healed enough that he won't bleed out, and we'll try again in the morning when his core will have had time to replenish somewhat.""

""Try? Replenish somewhat?"" she parroted shrilly. ""Will he be ready to fight tomorrow night? Will he have his magic at his disposal when he must face three others? Or more? The Dark Lord was quite impressed tonight. He may keep challenging him further."" The graceful woman began to pace and wring her hands. ""Well!?""

Blaise shuffled. ""I don't know, Ma'am,"" he admitted, ""I will do everything I can to bring him back to full health, but they nearly took him down tonight."" She could tell that Blaise was nervous and upset. Mimsy patted his hand consolingly.

""Mistress Cissy, he does what he can. No more fights for the Young Master!""

""We can't stop them!"" Narcissa cried, as tears rolled down her cheeks.

""Mother, please calm down,"" Draco begged. He was exhausted and his mother's panic wasn't helping. 

""No! I won't calm down. This is ridiculous. He will keep on until they kill you. You must leave, my son. Take your nasty wife and run.""

He stared at her. ""Will you come, too?"" He carefully showed no emotion as he asked. They had this conversation regularly, but it had never been under such dire circumstances before.

""I cannot leave your father,"" Narcissa said with bitter finality.

""Then I can't leave either."" His expression was sad this time, a new development in the argument when he usually became angry instead. Narcissa looked at him more closely and saw a terrifying acceptance in her son's eyes.

""No. NO!"" she cried. ""You are not giving up like that, Draco. Aren't you supposed to protect that wife of yours? Get her with child? Staying here isn't protecting her. It's delaying the inevitable.""

""I won't leave without you, Mother."" he stated, even though the thought of Granger eventually being helpless to Lord Voldemort and his horde was physically painful. It was more painful than the accepted fact that he would be dead when that happened. But he would take his mother with him or damn them all. 

""Please, Drake,"" Blaise suddenly begged, ""You can't just kill yourself staying here when there is a way to leave."" He paused. ""I assume there is a plan to leave, Narcissa?""

""A number of them, but the easiest is for him to simply go to our French cottage and disappear from there.""

""As I've said before, Mother, the Dark Mark will pull me back. Godfather isn't with us anymore to make the potion that suppresses it."" 

Narcissa looked defeated for a moment. Losing Severus had been a deep blow for her. If she hadn't wanted the Dark Lord gone before, knowing he murdered her oldest friend and one of the only people she truly trusted would have sealed her mutiny. ""We have a little left, from the time he let you test it. Perhaps that would be enough to get you through the beginning. I could create a distraction here to get his mind on something else.""

""Again,"" Draco said through his teeth, ""I will not leave here without you, Mother.""

""Then let the Death Eaters have her, son. The Mudblood isn't worth it!""

Draco stood angrily, towering over his mother, ""Do not ever speak of my wife that way again, Mother. I will not share her, especially not with those foul...""

""Draco!"" his mother squealed, ""Mind where we are!""

He rolled his eyes as he dropped wearily back onto the bed. ""We've been discussing running away. What difference does it make if I speak truthfully of the idiots father has forced us to associate with? Nevermind. The important part to understand is that I will take care of my wife.""

Narcissa stubbornly began, ""Draco, you must...""

Mimsy had been going about the room tidying as she listened, but now turned around, ""Mimsy fix this. Mimsy can takes Young Mistress to the cottage. No Young Miss, no fighting.""

Everyone stared for a moment. Narcissa opened her mouth to argue, but shut it quickly. The logic was sound. Slowly, she said, ""There would be torture. Draco, it would be better if you went, too."" He glared and opened his mouth before she waved him off, ""Yes, I know. You're not leaving here."" 

""Family is everything,"" he said.

""Granger's your family now, too,"" Blaise interrupted. 

Draco looked paler when he said, ""Family who will be safer and better off with her own people. Mimsy, could you take her now?""

""Of course, Young Master,"" Mimsy answered hesitantly, looking over at the girl in question.

Hermione had been watching and listening quietly to this point. ""No."" 

Draco looked at her, frustration marring his brow. ""You will do as I say. You don't love me as I do my mother. There's no reason for you to stay here.""

""Your dungeon is full of reasons I should stay,"" she argued, ""But more than that, I can't go until you're healed.""

""What?"" Blaise said before Draco could process what she had said.

""The bond,"" Hermion began explaining, ""I don't think I can leave him right now.""

""Ridiculous,"" Draco said flatly, ""Besides barely being able to keep our hands off each other, it's not affecting us.""

Hermione gave him a look that clearly meant he was being obtuse. Narcissa wondered how deep the bond truly was. Hermione, though, was gearing into lecture mode, ""Mimsy found me this book I've been reading, Marriage Bonding Rituals, Rites, and Wrongs. It doesn't specifically address goblin rites, but I think the concepts are likely the same. The magical thread between us is just as they described. The way our magic worked together earlier, too. I think he may need me here to heal properly.""

""Your magic worked together?"" Narcissa queried. 

Draco shook his head, his eyes wide. ""It didn't. I don't know what she's talking about.""

Hermione looked confused and irritated, but set it aside, ""I'm not leaving here tonight.""

""In the morning, then,"" Draco demanded. She looked as though she would argue, so he rushed on, ""I won't survive another night protecting you, connected or not. You must leave in the morning.""

""And it must look like she escaped. Some way that you could do nothing about,"" Narcissa added.

""He'll still be punished,"" Blaise's smooth low voice sounded troubled.

""Hopefully less than the next few days would bring with her here."" Everyone could hear the fear in Narcissa's voice, but she couldn't hide it. 

Mimsy stepped forward and took her hand, ""Mistress Cissy, yous must go to bed or Master Lucius be mad. Mimsy not be failing you now.""

Narcissa looked fondly at the little elf and nodded, ""Goodnight sweet son. Rest and recover. Thank you, Blaise."" She didn't bother to address the Granger girl on her way out.

I still don't own these characters. They still belong to Rowling. 

On a positive, my beta @highlyintelligentblonde is awesome and much appreciated.

Monday, May 4, 1998; night

""Do you truly feel nothing between us?"" Hermione asked. She had been dumbfounded by that assertion, but had left it alone at the time, thinking perhaps he didn't want anyone else to know about it. Now that his mother, Blaise, and even Mimsy had left the two of them in the room alone, she wasn't letting it go.

Draco looked uncomfortable, his skin tinting pink. ""Obviously I want to shag your gigantic brains out, but other than that...""

""You have to know that I was helping you out there tonight,"" she stated firmly, fists on her hips as she got up from the chair she had been reading in and approached the bed. She would not get distracted by how wet her knickers were. She would not.

He wouldn't meet her eyes. ""I know some of it was wandless magic you were throwing around, though I don't understand how you've developed such strength at it,"" he admitted. He barely whispered, ""That bit at the end is what I don't understand. The magical surge. The way I felt the thread sparkle when I can't even see it.""

Hermione was quiet, too, as she sat down next to him on the bed. Her body was throbbing from his nearness. ""I don't know what happened either, exactly. I was praying you would have the strength and wishing I could give you some of mine. I was thinking it so hard that I sort of pushed on my magic, toward you. And then you were back up again and fighting. I felt...drained, but elated. It was the oddest feeling.""

He stared at her for a long moment before saying, in a husky tone, ""And what are you feeling now?"" Clearly, her proximity was having an effect on him as well.

Hermione was nervous. She knew she needed to do this. She even wanted to. A part of her brain was screaming that she shouldn't want to, but it didn't really change how she felt.

She slowly began to untie the robe she was wearing and let it drop as he looked at her, his eyes wide, pupils blown. There had been other things to talk about she was sure, but one central thing she had read was echoing in her mind and through her body. She ripped the tiny dress off her body and tossed it aside. ""I'm feeling...the book said, in several circumstances, that after magical sharing, the partners need to spend time alone, touching,"" her hand reached out for him as though it had a mind of it's own, ""and t..tasting and pleasuring one another to restore our magical cores more quickly."" 

Draco couldn't respond at all, just watched as her hand slid up his leg, over his thigh and along the waistband of his trousers. The bulge in them was obvious, but her hand didn't touch there. Instead, she pushed him gently down onto the bed as her hands explored his bandaged abdomen lightly and then slid up bare skin to his chest. She ran her fingers over his nipples and was surprised when it made him moan and squirm.

""So here's the touching,"" she said, swinging her leg over him for good measure and seating herself directly on top of his hardened cock. He was breathing hard at the sudden intense contact. She was so wet that the scrap of cloth she was wearing was soaked. He felt heat and actual wetness when she ground against him. ""Now, what should the tasting be?"" 

She leaned down to kiss him and their lips meeting felt like a fire roaring to life between them. Her tongue licked delicately over his lips, coaxing him to open up to her. As he gave way, she massaged his tongue with her own, pulling desperate gasps and mewls from each of them in turn. His mouth was at her disposal, whatever she wanted to do to it, to him. He gave back as much as she allowed him. He didn't offer any question on who controlled the kiss, but his erratic breathing and the way he pushed his body up into her told her he wanted more. She pulled away and he whined helplessly.

""It was quite specific about tasting,"" she breathed. Her voice was nervous, but gained strength as she went on, ""We need to know the very...essence of one another."" She stared into his mercurial eyes, bright silver with desire. ""You will taste me first,"" she commanded, and her body began moving. 

Her hands grabbed hold of his, placing his fingers under the band of her knickers. ""You may move your hands only as much as I tell you."" He bit his swollen lower lip and nodded. Hermione surprised herself with the depth of her desire to suck that swollen lip back between her own lips, to put her teeth there again and nibble until he was whimpering and begging. 

At this moment, she had other plans. She began moving her body forward. His hands, held still as she had ordered, hooked and pulled her knickers down as her body moved up his. When she reached a point it would no longer be sexy to slide that way, she quietly directed him to pull the knickers the rest of the way off. He obeyed without question. 

His eyes were glued to her lower abdomen and lower as she brought her slick and fully exposed center closer and closer to him, hovering over him. Barely breathing, his wide eyes snapped up to hers. She was staring down at him, lust filling her amber eyes. Draco swallowed hard and rasped, ""Wh...what am I supposed to do? I've never...""

""The point is to taste,"" she reminded him in a tone that brooked no argument. She gingerly settled a thigh on either side of his head, careful to avoid his injured shoulder, and waited for him to figure it out. The wait was brief. His tongue snuck up along her folds, tentative at first, then stronger. He groaned, ""You taste...so...good,"" between laps of his tongue. She started to move off of him, anxious for her taste of him, and trying out the ""pleasure"" part she had read about.

His hands moved up to cup her arse, holding her in place. Hermione opened her mouth to chastise him for using his hands. The extra pressure of him pulling her closer made her cry out instead. Her body wanted to rock on his face, but she didn't dare, worried he wasn't going to be able to breathe like this. His hands suddenly pulled her up and away from him just an inch or so. She started to get angry, but then felt his lips kissing along her inner thighs, first one, then the other, making his way back toward her center. 

When he got there, his tongue delved inside her, making her squeal and gasp from the new sensation. His deep chuckle sent vibrations against her, his nose prodding the nub at the apex of her slit. Hermione let out a long moan when he nudged the spot again and moved his tongue there, his mouth working around it as though he were snogging her mouth. Her moan turned into a mumble of words getting progressively louder.

""Yes, yes! Merlin, just like that!"" Hermione could feel the intense heat engulfing her, waves of fire lapping between the two of them with each stroke of his tongue. Her whole body began to quiver as the fire spread through her until every part of her was heated. In her center, the fire was coiling tighter and tighter. His tongue licked up her slit again and danced across her nub. Pleasure erupted inside Hermione. She screamed his name and swore she saw stars exploding around her. She couldn't breathe; it was so overwhelming. She felt the sparkling thread between them and stroked it with the fulfillment she felt. He quaked under her and moaned.

""What was that?"" his voice was tinged with awe.

""The orgasm,"" she asked, rolling off of him and squirming down so their faces were back together, ""or when I do this?"" She felt her magic practically singing and moved that feeling up and down their thread. Draco gasped as goosebumps broke out across his skin. Hermione giggled into his shoulder and did it again. He moaned and curled his body into hers. 

She remembered as he rubbed against her like a cat that he was still straining against his trousers. When she looked into his eyes, they were dark with his arousal, glazed over with lust and what looked almost like desperation. One more time, she flicked her purr of pure contentment up and down the magical thread between them. He bucked against her, the look of desperation more intense. 

""Please,"" he moaned, ""Please may I be inside you? I need...""

Hermione felt a flood of her juices at the tone of his voice. He was begging her. This wasn't the arrogant Slytherin Prince she had always known. This man was hers, absolutely hers - to command or to care for - whichever brought her happiness. It was a heady feeling. Her voice was strained as she told him no. 

""Of course not, Draco,"" she nuzzled into his neck as he whimpered, ""Have you already forgotten I need to taste you?""

""Taste?"" he whispered like he had never heard the word.

She began kissing him as her fingers fumbled with unbuttoning his trousers. He started to rip them open himself and she yanked her lips away from him. ""You know better,' she said, taking his right wrist in her hand and moving it down to his side. His left hand she gently put back in place where the sling - now twisted and pushed aside - would naturally hold it. ""Keep them there,"" she demanded, moving her own hands to roam down his torso, careful over his bandages, but without avoiding them completely. 

Finishing the unbuttoning process, she began to push the trousers down his legs, her whole body sliding along him in the process until her lips were flush with his dick. She was nervous, not knowing quite what to do, but her body was filled with excitement. What he did to her had felt so good, she was determined to make him respond as well. As she had that morning, Hermione licked from bottom to top first, swirling her tongue around the head when she arrived. His gasp made her wetter, and she hummed against him. She was fascinated by the silken texture, the contrasting steel within.

Licking along the slit on top, she enjoyed the salty taste of the fluid there. Much like he had to her, she began to move her mouth around the top as though she were kissing. His body was trembling in response as he moaned. Hermione feared what she was doing was too sloppy as some of her saliva slid down his shaft. Without thinking, she moved her mouth further down to catch it, her tongue licking as she went. Draco's guttural moan sent pulses of need deep in her center. She was delighted to find that pulling her mouth slowly back up to the tip made him cry out. 

She moved down and then up again without pausing, savoring his taste and the way he was moving to push deeper. With a wicked grin, she pulled off and said, ""No moving or it all stops."" He only whimpered in response, his hands in white-knuckled fists, she noticed, eyes screwed shut. She gave him no chance to prepare for the assault of her mouth sliding as far down his shaft as she could manage. He tried to hold his body rigid, but couldn't quite stop himself from moving. She sucked in, yanking all the way up with the suction of her mouth. He came up off the bed with her, his cock pulsing in her mouth. 

""Please, please, please,"" he whimpered. ""I can't hold back if you do that again,"" he gasped, his breath coming in shallow pants. His eyes were wide and staring straight into hers with desperation and desire.

""Hmmm,"" she hummed against the tip and watched him shudder, ""I think that might have counted as tasting you then. What do you think?""

""Yes,"" Draco managed, panting, ""Merlin, yes.""

Hermione laughed. ""And now it's time to move on to pleasure.""

""Sweet Salazar,"" Draco murmured, ""Is this not pleasure?""

""Well, not the kind of pleasure the book suggested we need.""

""I want to move to the pleasure then,"" he gasped as she wrapped a hand around his cock and began pumping at it as she moved her lower body forward again, bringing herself to hover over him, right up against his dick, sopping wet and throbbing for him. She tried to roll the two of them so that he would be on top.

""No,"" he moaned, ""You...you should come down on top of me. Granger. I don't want to hurt you.""

""I'll be ok. Truly,"" she told him, embarrassed that he thought she couldn't handle it, even though a small part of her brain was screaming that this was too much like the day before.

""I...I'm sorry Granger,"" he said, sitting up and pushing her back somewhat, ""I can't keep from wanting you. This feels amazing and I need it, need you, but. You can't really want me...and I'm afraid you expect me to know how to do this.""

""I was a virgin until yesterday, Malfoy. I promise you know more than I do.""

He took a deep breath. ""No, actually I don't. I was a virgin, too.""

Her eyes rounded. ""Are you serious?""

He swallowed hard, ""Yes. It's not something I'm proud of. I would hardly lie about it."" He laughed at the sudden light in her eyes. Here came the swotty bookworm.

""But that's incredibly rare, Draco! For both people to enter a bond as virgins is almost unheard of - lots of people claim to be, of course, but it's rarely true. It's supposed to be an intensely powerful bond when they do! There's so much to research about what that means!""

Draco was laughing. ""Can we save the research for another day? For when you get back to your friends?"" he added with a sobered tone. For a moment it had seemed like she enjoyed being with him. Instead of just needing his body. If only he didn't need hers just as badly. 

Knowing it might be insensitive, he suddenly grabbed her, pulling her up close against him. ""Tonight is about pleasure,"" he whispered as he returned to snogging her. 

She rubbed her aching center against him again, ready for more, both of them whimpering at the contact. Hermione felt a desperate need to have him inside her, immediately. He certainly wasn't going to complain any longer. She eased her body over him, as he had requested. She was so wet, he barely had time to line himself up before he was inside her, buried to the hilt. Hermione cried out, somewhere between a sound of pleasure and pain.

Draco was gasping against her neck and shoulder as he kissed her there, his nose buried in the sweet cinnamon and honey scent of her hair. He held still for a moment, letting her adjust to being filled. He was breathing hard, straining not to move, until her hips slowly began moving above him. Draco's long platinum eyelashes fluttered as he was nearly overcome already. The intense desire was making it difficult not to come apart the moment they were connected.

Hermione didn't seem able to fight it once they were moving. She threw her head back and screamed out his name, ""Draco! Yes! More!"" as she fell apart around him. He was unable to hold back once he heard his name on her lips. For a moment, there was a blinding flash of golden light shimmering between them as he pumped erratically into her until he was spent. She collapsed on top of him, breathing heavily into his neck.

Neither of them said a word for long minutes. She finally rolled off of him, coming to rest her head on his shoulder with his arm clinging lightly around her waist. Hermione couldn't entirely believe what they had just done. Or how amazing she felt now. Even more, she couldn't believe her body was already screaming for it again. She was vaguely aware that this had been shorter than novels she had read including the subject, but it didn't seem to matter. She had certainly enjoyed what they did and they would learn more as time went, she assured herself. 

Then she remembered there wouldn't be more time. She shrugged internally. She would learn with someone. And so would he. There was a hollow feeling inside her at that thought, and the desire for more intensified.

""I'm sorry I couldn't last longer,"" he said, still sounding blown away, ""But that...that was amazing. Did you feel that...see the shimmering?""

She nodded against him. ""It was the bond. How does your magic feel?""

He paused a moment. ""Full,"" he whispered in awe, ""Thrumming with life. Almost overwhelming.""

""Mine, too.""

*******************************************
Tuesday, May 5, 1998; morning

Draco was shaken awake, a wizened little finger on his mouth to indicate quiet. He tried to shake the sleep from his eyes as he brought his nose away from the intoxicating curls it had been buried in. Mimsy was standing beside the bed. She was behind him since his body was curled delightfully around the little witch nestled against his body. Their legs were even intertwined. It took him a couple of minutes to work his way out, Mimsy waiting for him silently. 

""Young Master,"" she whispered, ""I needs take Young Mistress away.""

Draco's whole body seemed to hurt all of a sudden, but he knew this was the only way to protect her, the only path toward his possible survival as well. He thought for a moment. ""Mimsy, I know I don't give you commands very often, but I have some today."" He took a deep, almost shuddering breath. He felt a deep pang at what he was about to do. ""She can't know what happened here. I don't want her to remember that awful first night. When you reach the cottage, you will obliviate her.""

Mimsy gasped and her hands flew to her mouth, ""Master, no! Mimsy can'ts be attacking a witch! A Mistress witch!""

""You must,"" he ground out, ""I, as your master, command it.""

The little elf looked distraught, with tears running openly down her face, but nodded.

""The last thing she will remember will be the battle, just like all the other prisoners. You will tell her that Blaise Zabini just left after obliviating her and that you must run together. She won't remember Blaise as a healer, but I want someone on her side to think he might not be evil.

""Together, Young Master?""

Draco swallowed the lump in his throat. There had never been a point in his life without Mimsy there to take care of him. ""I am your Master right now, Mimsy. And so you will follow these commands I give you even when I am not around."" He took a deep breath, hoping it would really work that way, ""She is never to know my name. If she asks or tries to find out in any way, you will refer to me only as Master. You will not call her by the name of Lady Malfoy or mention anything about the family name. Call her Mistress Hermione, Mistress Granger, or whatever name she wishes. You will not let her know she is married. With the obliviation, she won't know. She doesn't have to feel tied to me. You will not accept freedom from her, though you can take wages if it suits you,"" he chuckled, knowing Hermione would try to insist and that the disgusted look on Mimsy's face meant she would not be accepting. ""You will see her safely to her friends with the Order of the Phoenix, no matter what she says. My wife is your sole Mistress. She is your family now.""

Mimsy nodded, the tears flowing down her cheeks. Draco was surprised when she suddenly threw herself at him in a tight hug. ""I's be taking good care of Young Mistress. And I's follow all Master's rules.""

She let him go and Draco watched her with regret. ""I have two more things you must do for me, Mimsy,"" he reached to the nightstand where his wand, rather his mother's wand, rested. She had let him use it since Potter absconded with his. ""Give this to her as soon as you are at the cottage. Have her dress in some of mother's clothes there, but don't dally. Take this, too,"" he said, handing her the beaded bag he knew Granger never went anywhere without. ""Now."" This was the hard part. He picked up a paperweight from his desk. ""You must hit me with this. In the head, as hard as you can, Mims. Hard enough to knock me out.""

Her already huge eyes seemed larger suddenly. ""I can't do that Master.""

""It's a command. As soon as I'm unconscious - and yes, it has to be from a blow to the head, not your magic - apparate her to the cottage.""

He closed his eyes to wait for the blow. Each breath was painful with the knowledge Hermione would soon be gone. He had one hand on the bare skin of her back and the other sunk into her curls when he felt a sharp pain and knew nothing else.

*******************************************

Hermione groaned and opened her eyes, her stomach heaving. As soon as she was able, she leapt from the floor and into a crouching position, feeling desperately for her wand. She was sure she was at Hogwarts, leaping in front of Bellatrix.

Except she wasn't. She had come awake laying on the floor. Now she was standing, completely nude, with no wand, in a luxurious greeting room to a house she had most certainly never seen before. A distressed house elf stood before her. The poor thing was quivering, making Hermione drop somewhat out of her fighting stance, though still wary. 

""Mimsy not meaning to upset Young Mistress,"" the house elf sniffled and blew her nose into a plain white hanky that she tucked back into her old, patched, but very clean and tidy, pillowcase.

""I'm not...upset with you, I don't believe,"" Hermione started. She wasn't sure what else to say. ""Where are we?""

""France, Mistress, but Mimsy musts be getting you out."" The elf began walking out of the room and up a grand staircase.

""What?"" Hermione asked as she followed rapidly behind. It was baffling how such a tiny creature could move so fast. ""Elf,"" she called as she had just lost her somewhere ahead down a long hallway, ""Whose home are we in? Could I...maybe...borrow some clothes?""

Mimsy popped next to her holding up a set of lovely blue robes, some underthings far fancier than Hermione had ever owned, and a pair of beautiful dragonhide boots. ""Gets them on now, Miss! We must go!"" the little elf, Mimsy apparently, cried impatiently.

Hermione was so confused, but certainly felt better as she slipped on the clothes. They were too big for her, especially in length, but with a snap of Mimsy's fingers, they fit perfectly. Digging in a pillowcase Hermione just realized the elf was carrying, she pulled out two things that made Hermione's heart stop. One was a beautiful wand she had never seen before, covered in vining ivy carvings. The other was her very own beaded bag, the one that contained basically everything needed for going on the run. Mimsy thrust them at her. ""Comes with Mimsy, Mistress!"" 

She rushed them back down the stairs and out a door that must be at the back of the house. They let out into the most exquisite gardens she had ever seen. Hermione stared around in wonder as she saw unicorns grazing on fairy-covered flowers, a beautiful brook babbling through the garden, literally singing as it babbled by. There were charming bridges made of a shining stone here and there over it. Some kind of delightful little creature with wings - it looked a bit like a squirrel or chipmunk otherwise - was flitting around them chattering. Mimsy took her hand and towed her along past it all. They crossed one of the bridges and came to a wall of green hedges that seemed to blush pink everytime the breeze hit them. Mimsy snapped and a door appeared in front of them. She started forward, then emitted a frightened squeak as a ward flash went off. The elf turned to her with wide eyes. ""Please, Mistress, take Mimsy's hand.""

She took the offered hand and stepped forward nervously, ""Mimsy - perhaps I should try to take down the ward first."" 

""No, Mistress. It be fine for you. Mimsy not belong here now."" 

""Should I go first, then?"" Hermione asked, confused but focused on getting out. 

""Yes, Mistress.""

As Hermione moved toward the gate, she absentmindedly said, ""Please don't call me Mistress, Mimsy. My name is Hermione and that will do."" The little elf made a sound that was suspiciously like a snort.

A strange light suddenly appeared around Hermione, turning a shade of green before morphing to blue and allowing her through with only a tight squeezing feeling. Mimsy made it through in similar fashion. ""What was that?"" Hermione wondered aloud.

""Yous not keyed to the property wards, Mistress Hermione. Buts they knows you by blood."" Mimsy explained cryptically.

Hermione looked around. They were on quite a normal-looking street of villas, assuming you recognized French architecture. They were far larger than Hermione had seen, as this was clearly an affluent neighborhood, far from touristy areas. Tourists. ""Are we in Paris, Mimsy?""

""Yes, Mistress Hermione.""

""In the wizarding part of town?""

""No, Mistress. We be...""

""Mimsy! You can't be out in Muggle Paris where any old muggle might see you!"" Hermione, trying her new wand for the first time, cast a quick glamour on the elf. It didn't turn out the best. She now looked like a Disney cartoon witch, but at least her giant ears were human-sized and her tiny stature could indeed be put down to age. At the best of times, witch's magic didn't work well on house elves. With a new and untried wand, she was lucky she hadn't glamoured the little creature into a troll or something equally disturbing. Sighing, she transfigured her own clothing into something more muggle. It took a couple of tries, but she was now wearing soft dark pants and a flowy blue blouse. She glamoured herself as well, to have long straight brown hair and a rather overly large nose between eyes almost as green as Harry's.

Hermione was thinking hard. She needed somewhere to go to sit with Mimsy and find out what was going on. But she had to be careful. In the wizarding world she might find help, but she might just as easily find Voldemort sympathizers. She didn't wish to endanger muggles, but she wondered if she might be safer hiding among a crowd of them. She was hungry anyway, and Mimsy couldn't be expected to produce food on the run even if Hermione was willing to ask her, which she certainly wasn't. ""Mimsy, please hold on to me. We're going to a place I know.""

They disapparated, appearing seconds later at the apparition point nearest Notre Dame Cathedral. Even though she had been ready for it this time, Hermione found herself throwing up at the nauseating experience. She had used entirely too much unusual magic today - first house elf apparition being different, then this new wand affecting her own magic. Mimsy held her hair back and produced a small glass of water from nowhere. Hermione was too grateful to argue. 

She began to lead the way to her favorite cafe in Paris. Au Vieux Paris d'Arcole attracted tourists year round, but it wasn't overly crowded since they had missed the beautiful spring Wisteria. It was perfect for what she needed. Leaving Mimsy outside, Hermione ordered for them both, then joined her odd traveling companion at a table outside, sitting in one of the cute purple chairs. She inhaled her food before speaking much. She had no idea when she had last eaten, but she was starving. It had been a tense morning and she had already thrown up twice. When she was done, and Mimsy seemed well fed as well, Hermione finally let her questions begin spilling out.

""Mimsy, whose house were we in when I woke this morning?"" Mimsy wrung her hands for a moment before saying, ""Master's house, Miss Hermione.""

""Who is your Master?""

""Hims not your concern. Yous my master now, Mistress.""

""What!?"" Hermione cried indignantly. She began digging in her beaded bag. ""I most certainly do not own a slave! Here!"" she said triumphantly, handing Mimsy a knitted hat. The little elf put it on. 

""Mimsy likes pretties. Thank you, Mistress."" 

Hermione looked at her aghast. ""You're a free elf now. You don't have to call me Mistress. Or anyone Master or Mistress!"" 

The elf patted her hand. ""Mimsy not being free. I serves my family. Master said Mimsy cans have as much clothes as hers wants, but never has to being free."" Hermione was struggling to hide her frustration and the little elf actually laughed at her. ""Mimsy be taking care of hers mind hers self, Mistress Hermione. Master just think him helps.""

Hermione huffed and moved on with her questions. ""How did we get in Master's house with no one else there?""

""Mister Blaise be bringing you. Hims obliviate then pops away.""

""Blaise. Blaise Zabini?"" Hermione asked, shocked. She hadn't heard anything about him being in raids or anything, but it was assumed he was a death eater. Why would he obliviate her and then just leave her in another country to run away? She must have been captured by Bellatrix. What purpose could he have had in obliviating her back to the battle?

""Yes,"" Mimsy said, sounding proud. She seemed to like Zabini. But then, if he was a death eater sneaking people out, and her Master was someone helping as well, it made sense that she would like the people working against the Dark Lord.

""Do you know why he...why he brought me without clothes?"" Hermione had been terrified by this aspect since she woke up, just burying the fears. She wasn't visibly hurt, but she did feel sore in a strange way she hadn't experienced before. Had Zabini raped her? Had he saved her from someone else who had?

""He was not be having much time, Mistress. Mister Blaise not be hurting you."" Mimsy sounded quite certain. 

A dark thought suddenly hit Hermione, making her bite her lower lip. What if Mimsy, and Zabini, had been ordered by this Master to act helpful and let her go, only to follow her straight to the Order? It made far more sense than some unknown death eater suddenly changing sides when it seemed like the Battle had turned in their favor. But had it? Hermione honestly didn't know if Harry had made his way to an ultimate confrontation with Voldemort or not. She had been so focused on the fight with Bellatrix that she really wasn't sure. Voldemort could be dead for all she knew. Or Harry...NO. She would not entertain the idea that Harry might be dead. But she needed information. 

She couldn't go back to the Order until she knew what was happening and had determined if she could trust this elf. She wished Dobby were alive to discuss. He would have known whether or not she could trust Mimsy. He might have even known who her mysterious Master is. 

Wishing did no good. Hermione knew she had to focus on present needs. A hotel room somewhere, so she could cast a few spells and send Mimsy for a copy of some Wizarding newspapers. She didn't have much Muggle money left, or any money at all really, but she remembered a colorful little hotel nearby that wasn't too expensive. With a destination in mind and plans for what to do, Hermione gathered her things and she and Mimsy set out for a walk.

That was my (and sort of their) first sex scene. And the first great escape for that matter. I hope to hear what you think of it!

Tuesday, May 5, 1998; evening

Bill appeared composed as he apparated to the front gate of Malfoy Manor. He made a striking figure, standing there alone in the late dusk. Seemingly alone, at least. He knew he had to be careful as he walked forward to touch the gate. It was crowded out here and the plan hinged on not giving that away until they were all inside the wards. Of course, there was the possibility that Lucius Malfoy would be able to tell how many people were crossing his wards, but all they could do was hope they made it in before he could do anything about it. Bill heard whispering in a couple of places, then a muttered scolding, followed by the Silencio the offenders should have had in place to begin with.

As soon as he touched the gate, he knew someone would be sent out immediately. Sure enough, two Death Eaters appeared in full robes and masks. They wore the generic masks of underlings, not the fancier personalized masks the inner circle wore. Bill waited patiently through their long, long walk to the gates.

""Who are yah and what do yah want?"" a surly voice came from one of the underlings.

""I am Bill Weasley. I am here on behalf of the Order of the Phoenix to negotiate the release of certain prisoners.""

They both laughed. ""What's left of the prisoners, maybe!"" said a younger voice this time, perhaps female, filled with dark mirth.

Bill did his best not to react to that statement, clearing his throat before stating, ""I wish to speak with the Lord of the Manor.""

Surly Voice laughed, ""Course yah do. Come on, then."" He waved his hand and the gates opened silently, the wards with them. 

This was the most important part. The longer Bill could stall, the more certain they would all make it inside. ""I'm not setting foot inside those gates until the Lord of the Manor comes out to me. I want to meet on ground that is as neutral as possible and I think that by these gates is the best.""

Suddenly, there were pops all over the front lawns as Death Eaters appeared everywhere. A limping figure with the shining white-blond hair of the Lord of the Manor shouted. 

""Why are you imbeciles letting in a bloody army!?"" The two underlings turned toward him in confusion when both suddenly fell, stupefyed to the ground. 

Tonks had dropped her disillusionment charm to give Bill a cheeky grin and take off after another Death Eater, before she tripped over herself but recovered in time to hit him with a stinging hex right where it would hurt. ""Wotcher, Bill! I've got this. You go help those kids get the prisoners out. Keep them safe!""

Bill cast his own disillusionment charm and began weaving through the many duels now happening all around. He could only hope the rest of the plan went as smoothly as this entrance had gone.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Ron was sprinting under Harry's invisibility cloak. He didn't know if the rest of his team was keeping up with him or not, that was an unfortunate part of this mess. He occasionally stuck his wand out to shoot a hex at someone as he darted silently past, taking particular joy in the slice he made down Bellatrix's arm. 

Having been to the Manor not long ago, he knew exactly how to get to the dungeons. The only problem was that when they arrived, the dungeons were empty: the doors standing open. 

""What?"" Dean Thomas exclaimed in bewilderment. He, too, had been a guest here recently and knew the way. He cancelled his disillusionment charm as he spoke and was followed by a number of others making their way in. 

Ron took only a moment to allow his disbelief in and then turned to the team, ""We know they're here somewhere. Everyone back to hiding. Dean, Seamus, Parvati, and George, you take the bottom floor - be careful - the snake himself may be here somewhere. Luna, Anthony, Ginny, and Justin - second floor, should be mostly bedrooms and the like. I'll take the top floor with Cho and Michael.""

""And me,"" Bill's disembodied voice said from the staircase. Ron just nodded at the space.

Invisible once more, they all set out. When Ron reached the third floor, he whispered instructions - Cho and Michael taking the rooms down the left hall while he and Bill took the ones to the right. Most rooms took just a moment to unward, but it was the fourth room that gave them pause. Bill had to work on it while Ron went down the rest of the hall and came back. ""Maybe we should just go, Bill. I heard a fight of some sort down Cho and Michael's way.""

""No. I've almost got this. There has to be someone or something worth getting to in this room."" As he said it, the last ward gave and he pushed the door open. Ron and Bill were both overcome when they saw Charlie's red hair and his blue eyes staring at them. At the door at least. It took Ron a couple of heartbeats before he remembered they were invisible and yanked the cloak off himself to run to his brother. 

Charlie was wearing dragonhide pants, bruises, and a collar that kept him chained to the giant bed in the room. He could stand and walk in a small semi-circle, even use his hands, but he couldn't get any further away and there wasn't anything to do within that space except pace like a caged dragon. Ron was sure his brother must be going mad. The decor here was an austere black and white. Charlie looked out of place against the luxury and severity of the room. He wrapped his younger brother in a hug just as Bill joined them. 

""Charlie! Let's get you out of here!"" Bill cried.

""No,"" their brother argued, ""The Longbottom boy is locked in the closet."" Charlie pointed. ""She's beaten him bloody and crucioed him half dead. She'll kill him when she gets back, or keep up the crucios til she drives him around the bend.""

With reluctance, Bill left Ron to figure out Charlie's collar as he worked on the closet's wards.

""Who is 'she'?"" Ron asked, though there wasn't much question which female Death Eater would do this.

""Bellatrix,"" Charlie confirmed, ""He gave us to her as rewards. We're not the only ones who've been given away either. You have to go find Professor McGonogall and Hermione!"" 

""There are teams searching each floor,"" Ron assured his brother, noticing how relieved he looked, ""Why'd she hurt Neville so bad but barely took a go at you?""

Charlie stared at his clueless little brother for a moment. ""Not what she wants me for,"" he said with a shrug. ""Listen, I only know so much. They obliviate us all often. But the other prisoners, the ones he hadn't given to anyone, they aren't here. I heard her talking to Nott about it earlier. They were transferring the rest to his manor, sending them there with his son as the acting Lord until Nott can go there next week. I'd get them out before then if you can. I think Fleur is with them.""

Bill suddenly groaned under the dead weight of Neville as he lifted the boy out of the closet. He was a true mess. Ron was surprised he was even alive.

""Charlie, stop talking like you won't be around to tell us this later."" Bill growled. His brother looked at him with sad eyes. ""Ron, take Neville. I'm getting rid of that collar."" 

Bill shot a weightlessness spell at the battered boy as Ron scooped him up and began to head out. He turned at the doorway, ""Bill, there are six Death Eaters at the head of the stairs. Cho and Michael don't look like they're in good shape."" Choking on a sob, he barely whispered, ""We're out of time.""

Charlie squeezed his brother's hand. ""Go, Bill. She's just another kind of dragon. Maybe I'll tame her, too."" He gave his brother a roguish grin that didn't quite reach his eyes.

""Charlie, I'm not leaving you here!""

""You have to,"" he said with grim determination, ""Bill, get those kids out of here!""

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Remus didn't know what to do with himself. He had come back feeling triumphant. Ron's plan had worked. Even with the Death Eaters being alerted so quickly - clearly Lucius Malfoy was able to feel each intrusion of his wards - many of them had been seriously injured, while none of the Order had gotten more than a broken arm. The prisoners mostly hadn't been there, but Ron and Bill had rescued Neville. They had also gathered some significant information. There had been hints that perhaps someone had escaped that morning, a Death Eater wondering aloud why they hadn't taken everyone then instead of coming back for an attack. They knew where the other prisoners, including Bill's wife Fleur, had been taken thanks to Charlie. They knew where McGonogall had been taken thanks to a muggleborn wizard, Finian, who had been a captive to Rookwood for almost two years and was now joining the Order. George had even found the formal study and made quick replicas of some of the Death Eater's plans. 

But his Dora wasn't back. That wasn't part of the plan. Not at all. Remus couldn't control the despair he felt when he thought about going home to their baby boy without her. Merlin, he had told her not to come. They had barely survived the Battle, it had been a miracle neither of them were dead or taken then. But now. Now she was gone. Would they move her to Nott Manor as the other prisoners were? Would she be given to someone? Locked away in the previously empty dungeons at Malfoy Manor? How could this have happened?

""Professor Lupin!"" one of the kids called. He didn't want to answer. Could they not leave him alone for a few moments of grief?

It was Ron. ""Professor Lupin! They said to come to you for information, sir. That everyone reported to you. What did we find out about Hermione?""

He stared at the boy. There were tear trails down his face. Remus knew they had found his brother Charlie, too, but hadn't been able to get him out before the death eaters overwhelmed them. Leaving him behind had broken Ron's heart, Bill's too, he had heard, even though the second Weasley brother had apparently put on a good face about it when he told them to go. He coached himself not to yell at Ron. The boy didn't know about Tonks. He didn't know that Remus' heart was broken, too, and that he couldn't bear to discuss yet another missing person.

""There was no word of her, Ron.The report Bill gave says Charlie mentioned her in a way that implied she was given to someone, but we don't know who. No one saw any signs of her.""

Ron's whole face and ears turned red. ""That can't be true! Is she somewhere dangerous? You think we're not brave enough to get her out? I'm going to find her anyway so you better just tell me where she is!"" He was physically getting into Remus' space.

Now Remus wasn't the only one angry and reeling. His wolf growled at the foolish boy in front of him. Ron's eyes grew a little wide at the growl, but then his face changed back to anger and he continued to yell vitriol. Remus barely managed to keep his tone above a growl, ""You're not the only one hurting. You're not the only one missing someone.""

""I've lost Hermione and Harry and Charlie and Mum! Don't try to pretend all the people you aren't even close to mean you've lost something I haven't. You better tell me wh...""

Remus shoved him against the wall, nearly losing all control. ""Tonks is missing thanks to your little plan."" 

Ron's face paled immediately as he started stammering an apology, ""I had no idea. I'm so sorry, Professor!""

""I'm not your damn professor."" Remus took three very deep breaths while Ron continued to babble. ""Look,"" he interrupted, ""Your plan was good, Ron. It went exactly as we had hoped. Tonks is the only part that didn't go right.""

""And leaving Charlie. And not finding Hermione,"" Ron added glumly. 

""It's been a long night, kid. I understand, truly, how you're feeling. Now get out of my sight before I lose my temper again. The wolf is worried about his mate and far too close to the surface tonight.""

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Severus Snape was fairly certain he would have been better off letting the snake finish him off. His recovery was excruciating and slow - so excruciatingly slow. There were Weasleys in and out of the hospital wing at all hours, sometimes wailing and carrying on. Potter, of course,  had constant visitors. Then there were minor inconveniences like everyone hating him and being sure he was evil. He needed to be up and about so that he could go down to his potions lab and find a way to wake the Chosen One.

Of course he would let everyone believe it was just so that Potter could clear his name. There was no reason to talk about how much Lily's son meant to him. He also hated him, of course. Half James and exactly like him in looks and attitude. But every now and then he was struck by the boy's internal goodness and how very much like his mother he was in that regard.

Severus had argued to Kingsley just a little while ago that he needed to be released, full healing be damned, so that he could get on with it. He could tell the man fully agreed. It probably didn't hurt that no one really cared whether he made a full recovery or not. Except Madam Pomfrey, of course. She treated everyone whether they deserved it or not, regardless of her personal feelings about them. Severus admired that, even aspired to it, but he was still irritated.

As he had that thought, the lady herself came huffing toward him. ""I'm told I have to let you out. Even though you can't walk all the way down to that drafty dungeon of yours alone.""

""There are spells for that,"" he snapped.

Pomfrey rolled her eyes at him and said, ""Your magic isn't ready for you to be working any of them and you won't be getting your wand back anytime soon anyway. Lucky for you, there's one student here who's willing to help you."" She pushed forward a very subdued-looking Gregory Goyle. The boy was just as enormous as ever, but he looked sad and a little lost. He said nothing and Madam Pomfrey offered no explanation for him being there. The boy wasn't branded, but Severus knew he had planned to be a death eater as Malfoy and his father had both told him he would be. 

Before Severus could say a word, the hulking boy leaned down and scooped him out of the bed, carrying him bridal style. Severus immediately began to fight and curse. ""Put me down you overgrown imbecile!"" The boy walked sedately on. People quickly filled the hallways as they went to see what the commotion was about - and stayed because everyone was badly in need of a laugh these days. Someone even got their hands on Colin Creevy's old camera and caught a picture or two. Severus was mortified.

He was sitting in what had been his chair behind the familiar old desk in the dungeon before he stopped screaming. Professor Slughorn was there, but had immediately hopped up  when they burst through the door and backed up against the wall. Straightening his hospital gown, Severus glared at the boy still standing nearby, looking like he planned to become a statue. ""Goyle! Fetch me some real robes this instant."" Goyle nodded and disappeared back out the door, leaving the two potions professors staring at one another.

Slughorn's eyes were huge as he said, ""I don't know what you think you're doing down here, but this is very much my potions lab these days, Severus.""

""I am aware,"" Severus drawled, biting back the bitterness he felt. He hadn't enjoyed teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts as much as he had always hoped, and certainly hadn't wanted the position of Headmaster. He found he rather missed his potions lab. He had become a potions master at such a young age because the Dark Lord commanded him to, but he had come to enjoy it rather quickly. It had taken far longer, but perhaps now he could admit that he even enjoyed teaching it - to the students who weren't dunderheads, that is, few though they were. Not that it mattered since he would never have the chance to teach it or anything else ever again. But, if he could wake Potter, and if the boy could forgive him, perhaps it was possible. ""I am here for potion brewing, Horace. It is assumed I may be Mr. Potter's best chance to wake up.""

""Oh my!"" Slughorn exclaimed, clearly a bit horrified. 

They were interrupted by Goyle's return with the robes he had requested. After a few very deep breaths, Severus stood. 

""I will be properly attired in a moment and we will begin. You will assist me as your cabinets are no doubt arranged as you like them."" His sneer communicated, as he meant it to, that the new arrangements were undoubtedly inferior.

He was well enough to walk to the ingredients cabinets and change inside. By himself, thank you very much. Goyle moved to follow him and help, but retreated when Severus glared at him hard enough. Slughorn was still staring with his mouth agape when Snape made his way back out, avoiding stumbling by clinging to the wall.

""Close your mouth and prepare three stations for us. One pewter cauldron, two silver. I have a number of ideas to begin with."" Severus didn't check to see if the professor was obeying, merely hobbled back into the ingredients cabinet and gathered a few items. When he returned and painstakingly walked toward a table, he found Goyle lifting cauldrons into place. Slughorn was sitting at his desk looking angry. 

""Are your ears as inadequate as your penmanship?"" Severus said sharply, holding up two bottles of powdered something. ""Which of these is powdered asphodel vs powdered ash petals? This one over here isn't even labeled! How would anyone ever know?""

Slughorn glared, ""See here, Death Eater, you're not welcome in my potions lab and your opinions certainly are not welcome. I always knew nothing good would come of you. I'm going to go have a talk with Madam Pomfrey and the Headmistress. You shouldn't be down here unattended."" With that, he whipped his sumptuous robes around himself and stormed out, leaving Severus and young Goyle alone in the lab. Severus rolled his eyes at the pompous idiot, then smiled. Figuring out the ingredients might be tedious, but this made the lab much more pleasant. Goyle might not be the brightest, but he could follow simple instructions. It would do.

Tuesday, May 5, 1998; late afternoon

The hotel was just as Hermione remembered, quaint and clean, but not overpriced. They were even running a special that allowed her two nights with what money she had. Perhaps that would be enough time to safely make contact with the Order and rejoin them. If not, it would give her a day to find a job somewhere that would let her help out day by day. 

As soon as they were settled in, she sent Mimsy to fetch the papers - The Daily Prophet, Le Paris Chouette, and a local muggle paper to get an idea of things. With her gone, it was the perfect opportunity to send out her Patronus. But who could she send it to and be sure she wouldn't compromise them? Did she even know for sure who was uncaptured? No. There was no one she was certain of. 

Hermione pulled a book quickly from her beaded bag and spent a few minutes reading. She would send to a place rather than a person. Shell Cottage was closest, and Fleur, at least, was bound to be home. Still. She couldn't say directly where she was in case the cottage had been breached. Within moments, she had a spell and a plan.

""Expecto Patronum!"" she began, but gasped and went no further when the creature that appeared was a glowing dragon instead of the otter she expected. Hermione's jaw was hanging open. A patronus didn't change randomly. As far as she knew, the only way to change them was through a deep and true love. What the hell had happened that she didn't remember? And now what? Her otter patronus was well known. If this dragon showed up claiming to be from her, they might not believe it. She barely believed it. 

Hermione sighed. There was no changing it back. Whatever had happened to her must have been significant. It was disturbing to realize she didn't know what that was, but nothing she could do anything about right now. As the dragon swooped around the room, she tried to refocus and work out her message, ""Bill, Fleur, or any friends from the Order, this is Hermione. I have escaped, but fear I am being followed. I need someone to meet me at Au Vieux Paris d'Arcole at 7pm to determine safety."" She brandished her wand again and watched her dragon swallow the message as she chanted, ""Nuntia Rem Loco Shell Cottage."" The dragon flapped its wings and flew off.

She had two hours before she would need to be back at the cafe. She didn't have money for more food there, so she intended to stand across the street until she saw someone arrive. And keep her glamour up. She hoped she was being overcautious, but she just couldn't be sure.

Suddenly, Mimsy popped back in, her arms full of papers and a couple of grocery bags. ""Mimsy gets dinner and yours papers, Mistress Hermione.""

Hermione was taken aback. She had been prepared to go hungry tonight. The food at the cafe was more than she had been accustomed to in a day while they were on the run. ""Thank you, Mimsy, but you didn't need to do that. How...how did you pay for food?"" The question was somewhat idle as she began flicking through the local paper since it was on top. She should have started with the Prophet but she was almost afraid of what she might find there. 

""Mimsy use Master's account to buy...""

""Mimsy, no! We can't use some Death Eater's personal account to buy food. He is a Death Eater, isn't he? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named will be able to figure out where we are!""

The little elf looked mortified. She grabbed for a lamp to hit herself with. It was only Hermione's experience with Dobby that allowed her to catch the lamp before she could. ""You may not punish yourself, Mimsy! That's an order,"" Hermione said. Her breathing was panicked, but she knew she had to calm down. And help Mimsy calm down. ""It's ok. It's ok. They won't even know exactly where we are, just somewhere in Paris. They already knew that probably, right?"" 

For some reason, Hermione had felt a pull toward England that she didn't think had anything to do with homesickness. It felt almost like a gossamer thread of magic tying her to something. Whatever that something might be, there was a wistful longing attached to it as well. It was barely a feeling, but now and then she would notice it, and somehow she felt like it could be followed to her if whatever was on the other end was used properly. The thought made her shudder, but she tried to refute it with logic. She knew of no magical items that would do such a thing. Anyone who found her would likely have just caught the mysterious 'Master' and discovered he had sent them to his Paris property. ""Let's just eat while I catch up on the news.""

Mimsy had brought a veritable feast. Hermione had every intention of stretching it out for several days under a stasis charm. They began enjoying tonight's portion as she perused the papers. The local paper indicated there had been a rise in crime, a number of unexplainable deaths and kidnappings in the area. The muggles were baffled, but for a witch the answer was obvious. Voldemort had followers or at least sympathizers in the area. She would have to be even more careful. The French magical news was focused on the aftermath of the battle. That many Undesirables had allegedly been captured, but Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, among many others, were still at large. She gave a sigh of relief. That feeling was less certain when she came to The Daily Prophet. The front page headline read ""Undesirable #1 On Death Bed?"" with a picture of Harry looking pained. Of course Hermione knew that picture was from fourth year during the Triwizard Tournament, but it had been manipulated enough to make her gasp at first sight. 

Hurt or not, Harry was alive. Ron, too, it seemed. She couldn't wait to see Bill or Fleur for confirmation. At 6:45, she assured Mimsy she would be safe and headed to the cafe, standing across the street, and watching diligently for someone she knew. 

A couple of hours later, she returned to the hotel room feeling defeated. Perhaps they had been called away from home for some reason. No Death Eaters showed up, so at least Shell Cottage hadn't been overtaken. She would try again tomorrow, after she had some sort of job for the day. Meanwhile, she let Mimsy fix her tea and fuss over her. She couldn't really stop her, and it honestly felt good to feel like someone cared. House elves were people, too, even if the little elf only cared because she was brainwashed to treat her that way.

She was just crawling into bed, shortly after 9:30, when the pain began. It wasn't acute; it wasn't even hers, she was quite certain. But she felt a deep sense that something was very wrong and someone she cared deeply for was hurting. There were phantom pains throughout her entire body. She was panicking, but this time it was Mimsy who calmed her down. She went to her little pillowcase bag and pulled out some sort of cream. She rubbed it gently on Hermione's chest over her heart, her stomach, and down her left arm. Mimsy didn't explain a thing, just said it would help. Hermione couldn't argue with the results. She still had that uneasy feeling that something was desperately wrong somewhere, but she no longer felt pain. Exhausted, she slid under the covers and into a restless sleep.

Draco was screaming along with his compatriots. Lord Voldemort was furious that they had allowed the Order of the Phoenix access to their very headquarters. Worse, a prisoner had escaped. The second one of the day. He had attacked his followers as a whole first - Draco had no idea it was possible to crucio so many people at once. Now the Dark Lord was concentrating on the two who had lost those most valuable prisoners - Draco himself, and his Aunt Bellatrix. He couldn't believe someone had actually escaped her. That it was Longbottom was even more astounding.

Draco didn't have time to think about it. His brain was rattling every time a new spell hit him. The Dark Lord had moved on from crucios to slicing hexes, crisscrossing his body in bleeding slivers. Each cut was small, but all of them together were making him light-headed from blood loss. Some moments he heard himself or Aunt Bella begging for mercy. He knew his Lord was often speaking at him, and was probably angry he wasn't responding. He hadn't heard any of the words Voldemort was saying for some time now, but he did notice that other Death Eaters were closing in around him. Without his wife, he was essentially worthless. Perhaps they were going to kill him now after all. 

He soon wished they would. He certainly didn't want to think about what they were doing to his body now. Only one prisoner had been gained tonight. Fenrir Greyback caught an Auror named Tonks. There was something else important about her, but Draco couldn't focus enough to recall. She wasn't Hermione Granger or Neville Longbottom, but she was high enough in rank to gain Greyback something he wanted. Watching Draco be knocked down a few pegs was also apparently something Greyback wanted. He and some of his lackeys began beating him, kicking him, perhaps slapping him with a belt. He felt someone spit on him.

His brain felt detached from his body. Too much fear. Too much pain. He wanted to pass out, thought he had once or twice. They had to be ennervating him repeatedly. It was quite late when he thought he was finally going to be allowed the sweet oblivion of unconsciousness. He heard Lord Voldemort's voice above him, but couldn't make sense of the words. He wanted an answer? Draco didn't have any answers. That was fine apparently. The snake would show him what he should have answered. The snake. The snake.

Impossibly, Draco forced his eyes open. The snake Nagini was making her way toward him, her body slithering excitedly. Merlin, she was going to eat him alive. He couldn't even track how much pain he was already in, but the terror of watching her glide toward him was enough to make him scream and beg. The last thing he remembered before blackness enveloped him was the snake's fangs lunging toward him.

Severus was frustrated. The first three potions he had tried hadn't worked. He had consulted with Madam Pomfrey when she came down to check on him and help Slughorn pack up. The pompous windbag refused to work with a Death Eater, or even be in the potions lab while he was there, so Headmistress Sprout was moving him to The Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade until he could stop being such a baby or until Severus was done. That's how he thought of it, at least. 

Putting aside the gleeful thought that he had run off that buffoon, Severus put his mind back on task. Perhaps he could reverse the Draught of Living Death and bring Potter back with that. No one had ever taken even a weakened Avada without it outright killing them, except Potter, of course. He had no idea why the boy wasn't dead this time, so it was hard to know what might work. Dumbledore would undoubtedly babble something ridiculous about love. Severus rolled his eyes.Since making his way into the potions lab, he had been able to dose himself with Pepper Up Potion and Pain Potions until he was walking around just fine and more than capable of taking care of himself. Still, he had let Goyle stay and sent the boy on a number of errands. He debated now if he should send him to get food. His stomach was rumbling and none of the brewing potions needed anything. 

He looked carefully at the overgrown boy staring into space over by the wall. He had not spoken a single word. Madam Pomfrey had confided that she thought something very traumatic happened to him during that last battle. Goyle had never been bright, but he was unable or unwilling to communicate at all now. In some ways, it made him ideal for fetching things - a handy thing for Severus to have around even if he was doing much better. 

But. The boy wouldn't be able to explain to the house elves what he wanted, so instead, Severus beckoned.

""This batch will be brewing for some time."" He started to walk out the door, then turned impatiently, ""Are you coming for dinner or not?"" With that, he led the way to the kitchens, the boy lumbering at his heels.

*******************************

Wednesday, May 6 into Thursday, May 7; afternoon until after midnight

There was another meeting early tomorrow. Everyone was supposed to be resting tonight. Though she was worn out from the raid last night and the intense emotions surrounding Charlie's almost-rescue, Ginny was using her rest time to bake pies again. She was having no better luck. But dammit, she needed to put her stupid love into the stupid pies. For Harry. For everyone.

She was exasperated when she heard the door creaking open. Had she not told the damn elves enough times to leave her be? She turned to yell at them and her jaw dropped. Professor Snape and Gregory Goyle had just walked into the kitchen. She was now having a staring contest with two Death Eaters. Maybe former-Death Eaters; she wasn't sure. The important part was that she was having a staring contest with them, alone, in a kitchen filled with failed pies. 

Goyle's eyes lit up at the sight of all the pies. He immediately reached for one.

""Oh don't!"" Ginny cried, ""They're awful. It's Mum's recipe, but they don't taste like pies should, and the stupid things are full of love but I guess nothing else that makes a pie come together right."" By the end, her voice was almost a wail. 

""We are here for dinner, Miss Weasley. Goyle, put that down. We'll take care of ourselves and be out of your way."" Snape stuck his nose in the air as though the very scent of the pies offended him. As he walked past the row of them, however, he suddenly turned on his heel, his cape flowing dramatically around him. ""Pies filled with...love, you say?""

Ginny was hesitant to answer. Snape had always been a bully, and the concept was whimsical at best. ""Mum always said it was her secret ingredient. I was hoping it would wake Harry. He's always loved Mum's pies. And Mum herself. Maybe I should feed her a bad one. She might wake up just to tell me what's wrong with them."" She laughed at herself for the thought, wiping away the beginning of tears before they could fall.

Snape was staring at her. ""Is that all you're adding?"" His tone made it sound like she was an utter moron.

""Well I've put in the bits that make it a pie, too, flour, sugar...""

""Yes, but the love,"" he drawled, sneering, ""how are you adding it? What other special ingredients are you adding?""

Ginny snapped back, ""With my magic, of course. Nothing else special, just following Mum's recipe.""

Snape stormed up next to her and looked at the recipe. ""A bit of rosemary for love. Molly's a genius. Add more rosemary. Let's see, sliced Adder's tongue, a bit of powdered dogwood, juice of aloe - not too much, yarrow for healing, some powdered thunderbird claw for strength, a bit of rose. Iris! Goyle, go to the greenhouse and fetch some Iris. Weasley, run to the potions lab and get these things I just listed.""

Ginny was staring at him. What was he doing? Seeing the focus on his face, she suddenly knew she didn't want to argue. She hiked up her robes and ran, all the way there and back with the ingredients he had mentioned. Before long, she was back to baking - with Snape by her side. He was almost in a frenzy, he was so focused. 

""Weasley, use your magic, but this time add hope as well as your love. We'll wake them as soon as these pies cool.""

Ginny did as he commanded, holding her breath until she felt her magic sink in. Now they popped those pies in the oven, several tweaked just the tiniest bit with this or that, and it was time to wait.

************************************************Thursday, May 7, 1998; wee hours of the morning

The first thing Harry was aware of was a strange but delicious taste in his mouth where there had been nothing for so very long. He hadn't been sure there ever would be again. He had been floating, hazy memories or dreams, he wasn't sure. Nothing truly significant. There was a yellow-green haze hanging around him through it all, but now it was fading, replaced by warmth, red and gold and a deep blue. There was the gentle green of rolling hills and plants. A subtle yellow from some flower. He tasted the colors and felt a wealth of longing to know what they were, where they had come from, how things were going to get better. Because they were going to. He could taste it. And love. Ginny. The love of a mother was somewhere in the background, too, but he mostly tasted Ginny.

His eyes flickered open to find her. Sure enough, Ginny was sitting next to his bed, a plate of pie in one hand and a fork in the other. Harry was confused to find Professor Snape hovering just behind her, and of course a concerned Madam Pomfrey next to him. Their faces, even Snape's, were filled with joy when Harry's green eyes swept across theirs. Ginny began crying happy tears. 

Arthur appeared behind Ginny, a partially eaten pie on a plate in his hand as well. ""It worked!"" he shouted. Harry could hear cheering and happy tears across the hall as well. Looking over, he saw Mrs. Weasley sitting up in a bed surrounded by three of her sons. One of those pried himself away and made his way over to Harry.

""Finally!"" Ron said, grinning. He shouldered his sister to the side for a moment to hug his best friend. ""We thought you weren't coming back!""

Madam Pomfrey pressed her lips together. ""That's enough of that talk. I need to look my patients over. Miss Weasley, Mr. Weasley, please go check on your mother while I check over Mr. Potter.""

Harry groaned, ""Please, Madam Pomfrey, there are so many things I need to know! I'm not even sure what day it is.""

Madam Pomfrey spoke up, ""It's been almost 3 days since the Battle. Voldemort is still out there, but his Death Eaters left once he was injured.""

""Oi! That reminds me. We need to know if we can trust this git,"" Ron interrupted, pointing to Snape.

""Ronald Bilius Weasley!"" his sister cried, ""He just saved Harry!""

""You baked the pie,"" Ron returned.

""But I never would have figured out the right things to add without his help!""

""Wait,"" Harry said, ""You've been baking pies...with Snape?"" He couldn't stop laughing as Madam Pomfrey shooed them away with the promise that they would be able to talk soon enough.

The last segment jump is marked with ****TRIGGER WARNING**** It is a non-con scene between Bellatrix and Charlie. Seriously, it's not pretty. Please don't read it if you think it may upset you. There are no further plot points in the chapter except Charlie dealing with Bellatrix.

Thursday, May 7, 1998; late morning

The atmosphere at the meeting was jubilant. Madam Pomfrey had grudgingly allowed Harry and Mrs. Weasley both to attend as long as they promised to return directly after. Molly was clearly wearing out fast, but Harry seemed to be gaining energy as he greeted each person and the general atmosphere of the room ramped up. Even Remus was somewhat happy, or at least deeply relieved, to see Harry.

If only Dora were with him to celebrate. This meeting was supposed to cover her rescue attempt, but the younger set were seemingly uninterested now. Did they even care that she was gone? He caught Kingsley's eyes and tried to convey that he needed the meeting to start. The other man inclined his head slightly, indicating that he knew.

Kingsley stood and waited a moment while everyone settled down. An excited Harry Potter was the last person to quiet. ""As pleased as we all are that Mr. Potter and Mrs. Weasley are here with us again, that is not what this meeting is for."" There were a few groans and mumbles. Some were ready for a few days of break. There was simply still too much to do, too many people to worry about to even think of taking the needed days to recuperate. 

First, Harry was asked about Snape and he told the entire story, spilling secrets that the older man was quite unhappy with being common knowledge. There were many still disgruntled by his treatment of students over the years, but it was accepted that he wasn't actually evil. Everyone was talking loudly, arguing amongst themselves about how far Snape could be trusted when they were interrupted.

Kingsley raised his voice and spoke somewhat harshly, ""He's one of us now. There are more important things to discuss. Tonks was captured during yesterday's mission. It is assumed she is still being held in the Manor. Meanwhile, the other prisoners from the battle are at Nott Manor. We will be sending two groups out today, one after another, to try and reach our people.""

Ron stood. ""With all due respect, sir, why are we sending the groups at separate times instead of together? Wouldn't it make more sense to either storm one at a time with full forces or divide and attack at the same time so that they can't call each other for reinforcements?""

""I think I've already come up with a reasonable plan. Sit down, Mr. Weasley and let the adults do their job. Without your plan for last night, we might not even need to do this."" 

Remus could see Ron fuming from across the room. He hated that his own harsh words had been so similar.  One of the Aurors, Robards, stood. ""Kingsley, the plan worked far better than we had imagined. The boy deserves some credit. We all know Tonks has a habit of falling into trouble."" There were a few giggles, and Remus had to smile. His Dora was one of the clumsiest people he knew. She was also an excellent Auror, but how she managed while tripping everywhere, he would never know.

He shook his head and tried to focus on the plans. He would be traveling to Malfoy Manor with several Aurors and a handful of kids - Dean, Seamus, Susan, Luna, and the new Finian fellow - to try to sneak back in. The other team included Kingsley himself, Bill Weasley, a couple more Aurors, and some kids - Ron, Michael Corner, and Cho Chang. Until Nott Sr. arrived next week, it was known to be lightly guarded. 

As they started to file out of the room, Remus felt a hand on his shoulder. ""Professor Lupin!"" Harry cried, throwing his arms around the man, ""I'm so sorry about Tonks! I could come with you and help.""

""No, Harry,"" Remus said. ""You need to spend a few more days getting better.""

Harry looked hurt and a little angry, but nodded. ""Well then, don't do anything I wouldn't do while you're out there.""

That made Remus laugh. ""You sound just like Sirius.""

""I am very serious."" Harry winked and walked away. Remus headed out with a lighter step and greater hope that he would return with the love of his life.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Hermione was feeling defeated. She had sent her message again twice today. The second time, she added The Burrow and Grimmauld Place as well. No one had come before and it didn't seem anyone would come this time either. She knew that many of them were still wanted Undesirables, so they hadn't been captured, but she wasn't sure where else they might be hiding. There was Hogwarts, of course, but she had no idea if they still controlled it or if the Death Eaters had it. 

She knew it was silly to feel so down after only two days, but her emotions had been out of control today. She had snapped at Mimsy this morning when she insisted on reapplying the cream that helped her phantom aches. She cried when no one came to meet her at the wizarding pub she had indicated this time. All day she had felt a sense of loneliness and worry. The feelings of pain she had two nights before were no longer with her, but she was still thinking about them and wondering where they came from - and if whoever had experienced it for real was ok today.

Now, she was facing the necessity of finding some kind of work for tomorrow so they could pay again. They could go into hiding in the tent as she had been with Harry and Ron for the last year. She just wasn't sure she had the energy to do that again. 

She looked around. This place, La Licorne Errante, was too slow, she thought, to offer work here. Plus she was using it as her meeting spot. If the Death Eaters intercepted her message, she didn't want them to see her here all the time, even glamoured. She had seen ""Help Wanted"" signs in a couple of shops, but she wasn't sure her French was solid enough to work in a busy shop. 

On her walk back to the hotel, she happened by a bookshop with dirty old windows you could hardly see through. What little she could see, though, appeared to be stacks and stacks of old books. It was squeezed so tightly between two other buildings that she wondered if it had been there all this time. There was a sign on the door wanting a helper, but Hermione wasn't certain it was recent. It may have been there for years by the look of it, but she decided it was worth checking and headed in.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Thursday, May 7, 1998; evening

Both raids were back now and the castle was in chaos again. Harry could only observe parts of it, still stuck in the hospital wing. There was an unfortunate amount of excitement here, though. Seamus and Dean were brought in by a man Harry didn't recognize - Finian, a wizard they had freed during the first mission. He answered all of Harry's questions about how it happened.

One of the Aurors had been killed almost as soon as they arrived, and Seamus and Dean had been injured shortly inside the grounds. No one even made it into Malfoy Manor. Still, they made more progress than the team at the other manor. Nott Manor was so well warded that Bill and Kingsley together couldn't break through to it. They had to leave when guards started running toward them. 

Harry, shooed away from Seamus and Dean by Madam Pomfrey, made his way over to the Weasleys. The family was all so relieved Molly was awake now, even if she was still weak. Madam Pomfrey was just a little miffed at them all for feeding her the magical pie. Apparently, she would have benefited from a few more days of outright rest before waking. Her condition was quite a bit more physically taxing than Harry's had been. As best as Madam Pomfrey had been able to explain it to him, it had been more of a mental or maybe spiritual block on coming back.

As he approached, Harry held out his arms to Ginny, who ran into them gratefully. They hadn't officially restarted their relationship, but unofficially they couldn't get enough of holding one another and talking quietly about absolutely everything. Ron rolled his eyes at them, ""That's my sister, you might remember,"" he good-naturedly ribbed his best friend. Harry grinned at him, not loosening his grip in the slightest.

""Harry dear,"" Mrs. Weasley called softly. She embraced him in a hug and fussed over how skinny he was, but she couldn't squeeze him as she normally would, and they weren't in her kitchen where she could try to fatten him up. Harry still appreciated the motherly care, but it felt off coming from her this way. As he glanced around, he could see worry in Arthur and Percy's eyes, a dull kind of acceptance in George's. Ron and Ginny didn't seem to notice how weak she was, but that was probably for the best. 

As he was pulling away, before Ginny grabbed him again, Harry revealed his purpose for coming over, ""Ron, can we talk over at my bed?"" Ginny looked curious, but let them go with a sigh. 

The tall, ginger boy followed him down a few beds to Harry's own, and they began to whisper. ""What do you think went wrong?"" Harry asked. ""With the mission?""

""What went wrong?"" Ron repeatedly incredulously. ""The idiots thought they could break in in broad daylight as just a force coming to the gates. Not that they would have fallen for the same trick as last time anyway, but you can't just knock on the door and ask for a fight."" He was raging and his skin had all turned a bright red. ""Now we've lost a good man - Nelson, pretty new, but well-trained - and we have two more good men injured. Seamus is in bad shape. Dolohov must've been there. What the spell did is sickening.""

Harry nodded along. ""What would you do instead?"" 

Ron took a deep breath. ""First, they either wouldn't be splitting up or they would split up at the same time. Second, we're not going to be able to use the front gates again anytime soon. The wards are a problem, but if Bill worked at them in a secluded location, he could get them down. They're not as intricate as the ones at Nott Manor from what I've heard. Now that we've tried a few times, I don't think large teams are a good idea for these raids. Just a couple could get in, maybe on broomsticks after someone got past the wards, grab the prisoners, and get back out. The same basic idea as before, but without the distraction of another battle. Quietly, this time. It's important to keep changing tactics on them so they never know what to expect.""

Harry stared at him for a moment. ""When did you get so good at this stuff?""

Ron scoffed. ""Who was the chess strategy champ first year? I've always been good at planning this sort of tactical stuff. There just wasn't a use for it until now.""

""We've got to get Kingsley and Lupin to listen to you!"" Harry said excitedly. 

Ron shook his head. ""I've already tried. They're blaming me for Tonks getting captured. That mission was my plan.""

""What!?"" Harry nearly shouted, quieting down at a vicious look from Madam Pomfrey. ""That's not right. You rescued Neville and gathered all kinds of information. You couldn't predict someone getting captured.""

Ron shrugged. ""I'm glad we went in, but I feel awful that she's there, now, too.""

""Too?"" Harry queried. He suddenly remembered a question he had been meaning to ask but had a sick feeling he already knew the answer. ""Ron, where is Hermione? I thought she must be off researching something somewhere, but it's not like her to have not made it by to see me. Or to miss the meeting this morning.""

Ron's freckles stood out against his pale skin. ""We don't know. She was supposed to be at Malfoy Manor, but no one could find her. No one knew anything about her. They obliviate everyone all the time, I guess. Leave them with a sense of pain and dread, but no memories of what has happened to them. Another form of torture, I guess. Or they want to be very sure no one knows what happens at their Revels and in the halls of their Headquarters.""

""How do you know so much about it then?"" 

""Charlie told us all he could, Bill and I. He belongs to Bellatrix, so he hadn't been obliviated lately. We couldn't get him out of there, but he told us all kinds of stuff. He's how we know the prisoners are at Nott Manor. And Finian knows a lot about how things work.""

""But Hermione's a prisoner somewhere, for sure?"" Harry looked somewhere between devastated and furious. Ron could only nod. 

Harry got that determined look on his face. ""They're going to listen to you, Ron. We're breaking in and we're going to get them out - all of them!""

 

*****TRIGGER WARNING*****

 

Friday, May 8, 1998; afternoon

Charlie swallowed hard when he heard a commotion in the hallway, but his chin was up and he was staring defiantly at her when Bellatrix burst angrily through the door. He still couldn't decide if it was easier to handle her anger or the maniacal highs when she had fun murdering or torturing people before she came to use him. The anger hurt more, but he felt like he had a little more control in those times, as long as he played along with her first. When she was excited....there was no telling what she would do or how she would react to anything.

Before he could complete a thought, the crucio had begun. He fought not to scream. He knew she would continue until he did, but it always seemed to amuse her the longer he could hold out. Amusing her was the best way he had found so far to calm her. Then they could get to the more enjoyable part. Charlie felt the intense shame, again, of realizing there was any part of this situation that he enjoyed, but he couldn't deny it to himself. This part was like the flame of his dragons - painful but exhilarating. He reached out and gripped the bed post, white knuckled, to hold himself back. When he finally gave in, even that hurt. His throat was raw from all the screaming since his capture. 

She was holding it longer than usual. Someone must have made her particularly angry this time. Or maybe it was just her way of saying she had missed him. She hadn't come back to the room in a couple of nights. Since before Neville's rescue. 

If he hadn't already been pale from the amount of pain he was enduring, he knew he would have gone ghostly white at that realization. She had to know he was responsible for them finding and freeing the boy. Fuck. This time she was angry with him.

""Did you think I wouldn't know you told them where to find him?"" she screeched at him. The crucio stopped so he could answer, but Charlie could barely catch his breath before another hit him. ""Of course you had to know, worthless blood traitor.""

He slid to the floor as his legs gave out. His screams had become almost silent, his voice so far gone that he couldn't make a sound. She laughed and let up on the spell. ""Worthless worthless blood traitor. Even they think you're worthless."" Charlie's hands were suddenly bound behind him, rigid, thrusting his chest forward as she pulled him up onto his knees. Her bony fingers grabbed his chin and yanked him forward, forcing his eyes onto hers. 

""I spoke with Mulciber and Yaxley. They were two of my dear friends fighting up here. They told me something interesting, something a little unbelievable - that your own brothers were the ones who left you here.""

Charlie gave no outward sign, but he felt like he had been punched in the gut. He had told them to. He had told them where the younger man was in the first place so they could rescue him before he died, but he wondered now if he had just volunteered to take his place. ""Told them to go,"" he rasped, unable to get more out.

""Ah. The brave dragon tamer. You're not a bit upset that two of your brothers cared so little about you that they let you stay here to be tortured? I had always heard the blood traitor Weasleys were all about family. You've been away, though, off in some far away country with your dragons. I guess you're not as much a part of the family anymore, are you?"" She laughed when he flinched just a little.

It had been a tiny movement, but he couldn't hide it. Charlie had felt like an outcast for years now. He had needed his space, but it was hard to see his family grow away from him while they all grew closer together. Even Bill. He knew there was a sheen of unshed tears in his eyes now.

""Your big brother is some great curse breaker, isn't he? You think he couldn't figure out this collar around your neck?"" She ran a finger along it, then slammed her hand against his neck and squeezed, making breathing impossible for long moments. Then she stood, grabbing him by the hair instead, wrenching his head up and his torso backward so that the muscles in his abdomen and thighs strained and the pain pushed the tears down his cheeks. She continued, laughing, ""The magic isn't even complicated on that thing. It would only have taken him a few minutes, I'm sure. But you aren't worth those few minutes. You aren't worth coming back for after they fought through my friends. They stunned them all - did you know? Of course you didn't. They left you here anyway.""

Charlie fought to breathe from the position she still held him in. He knew exactly how he needed to move to get out of this, years of getting caught in difficult positions by the dragons had given his body the muscle memory to do it, but he couldn't thanks to the collar, and it was painful. Coupled with the things she was saying - she had never attacked him like this before. He found the emotional battering, digging into his darkest thoughts and insecurities, much harder to take. That she was straining his body in such an exhausting way made it worse. If she hadn't been holding him up by his hair, he knew he would collapse right now.

Through his tears, he saw her smiling happily, the terrifying smile that meant she was truly enjoying herself. ""I must say I'm glad they don't care about you. I'm glad they left you here for me to enjoy. You're so pretty when you cry,"" she said sweetly, wiping away his tears with her free hand. He wanted to turn away, but didn't dare. He felt like she had beaten his soul and he just didn't have the energy to fight any harder right now. She pulled his body forward, allowing some of his tense muscles a break, though she left his hands bound and his chest pushed out. She seemed to like how helpless it made him. 

Taking his elbow in hand, she gently tugged him up onto the bed. He groaned as feeling rushed back into his lower legs. Her hands were caressing him as she settled him into a sitting position on the bed: so soft, so gentle. He was so exhausted that he relaxed into it as much as he could. 

The crucio struck him full force, so hard it made him scream immediately, despite the state of his throat. Charlie couldn't think. He saw stars and then blackness.

It felt like minutes later when he came to. ""Well,"" she said, clearly angry again, ""You're not being much fun tonight. But don't worry. I will take my fun from you.""

Charlie closed his eyes for a moment to block out this nightmare. He wanted nothing more than to escape, but he knew there was no way. He had let his only hope of that go without him. 

Bellatrix casually began moving his body again. She finally released his arms from behind his body but gave him no time to recuperate. When she moved him onto all fours, his arms collapsed instead of holding him up. ""Well, if you insist,"" she giggled. He found that his forearms were held to the bed with a sticking charm as well as his lower legs along his shins, leaving his arse solidly available in the air.

""Evanesco,"" she chanted and his dragonhide pants were gone, leaving him bare.

""No!"" he cried. Charlie felt panicked. She had taken them off before and he hated it. This was so much worse. The one article of clothing he had still been allowed was completely gone. 

""Accio paddle,"" she said, her voice filled with anticipation. ""Since the big bad dragon tamer can't handle any more magic, we'll just have to get a little....physical."" Charlie shuddered at the way she relished that last word, her hand groping at his bum as she said it. 

The paddling hurt, he could soon feel welts rising in places, but it wasn't anything like a curse. There was a rhythm to it that he could almost relax into if she had only been doing that. Soon, however, he heard her whisper, ""Piertotum Locomotor"" and the thick heavy paddle was hitting him by itself.

Bellatrix brought her hands under him, lightly stroking his cock. Even through the pain, he felt himself growing hard and she began laughing. ""I do wish you wouldn't lie to me and pretend you don't like this, blood traitor. Isn't it hard"" she squeezed his cock, ""to know that your body is a traitor, too?"" One hand traced down and cupped his balls while the other pumped along his shaft. His cock was hard as steel within moments, even as the paddle began hitting him considerably harder. Charlie's breath caught in his throat and he groaned with need. He knew that the more noise he made, the sooner this would end. Nevermind the fact that he needed to make the sound. 

She dropped his cock suddenly. Bellatrix moved to the head of the bed in front of him and began pulling up her skirts to reveal that she wore no knickers. Charlie tried to pull his head away as she maneuvered herself so that her center was directly under his face. Before he knew what was happening, her legs were around his head, forcing his mouth and nose into her cunt. He felt like he was suffocating. ""Mmmmm. Yes, just keep struggling like that, dragon boy. Use your tongue and I might let you out eventually."" 

Charlie had no choice. If he wanted to breathe, he had to move his mouth and nose to gasp for air, and that brought him into full contact with her most intimate areas. His cock was still hard and the arousal made a certain part of him want to lick and touch a woman - even her. He was furious that his body was betraying him again. He used that anger to lash out at her slit and her clit with his tongue as hard as he could manage.

It didn't take very long before Bellatrix was wiggling and screaming beneath his ministrations, calling him names and berating him as she did. He felt himself get even harder, especially as the paddle finally stopped when she lost her concentration in bliss. She released the spells holding him down, leaving only the collar to trap him to the vicinity of the bed. He moved away from her dripping cunt, sliding back on the bed. Bellatrix was spent, and it seemed their little session might finally be over. Only, Charlie was still achingly turned on.

He panted hard for a couple of moments. He could wank, but she would likely stop him just before he finished, making it worse. She was watching him through slitted eyes. If there was going to be an enjoyable ending to tonight's activities for him, he was going to have to make it happen in a way that would distract her. He would have plenty of time to hate himself for it afterward.

Before she could realize what he was doing, Charlie pounced toward her and flipped the woman onto her stomach, arse up just as he had been. With her skirts still up around her waist and her cunt soaked from her orgasm and his tongue, he slammed himself deeply inside her. Bellatrix squealed with surprise but didn't begin fighting against him until he was well and truly fucking her. He couldn't stick her to the bed with magic, but he was physically larger and stronger than her and managed to hold her in place as she struggled against him. He didn't dare waste any breath taunting her.

Suddenly, her fight to push him away became the breathy sounds she had made just before she exploded earlier. Her muscles tightened spasmodically around him as she came again, pulling him under with her. He gave a shout as he let himself go, deep within her. The orgasm had been so intense, and he was so exhausted that he was trembling as he pulled out of her and collapsed on the bed.

He didn't dare look at her, keeping his head turned away. A part of his brain was saying he would be better prepared for whatever she did next if he was facing her, but he just couldn't make himself.

""So the dragon tamer thinks he can take what he wants from me, does he?"" she said, still a little breathlessly. ""Crucio."" 

He couldn't make a noise, just soundlessly shook from the pain. She didn't hold it very long. ""Just a little lesson. I do enjoy you giving me another reason to punish you.""

Charlie shuddered with disgust when she ran her fingers through his hair and petted down his body. ""I enjoy these muscles. And the way you're trying to tell yourself you didn't enjoy it all. Next time you will let me look at you while you wrestle me. I might let you win again."" With that, she got up off the bed and headed for the door.

""And dragon tamer - if you're foolish enough again to try to escape or to help others - because there will be plenty of others - know that I will kill you, slowly and painfully.""

She left him alone in the room, nude and covered in her juices, with his own dark thoughts. Charlie was so drained that he fell asleep minutes later, only a few tears dripping from his eyes before they closed.

This chapter contains a new trigger warning - miscarriage. In general the scene they come upon is kind of rough. There will be a clear boundary before we descend into that part. I will provide a summary of the plot points at the end of the chapter.          

EDIT: This story currently has 91 subscriptions. When it gets to 100, I will release the next chapter (perhaps un-beta-ed depending on how much time she has) plus one at the regular time next Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

 

I am still not J.K. Rowling, so these characters and this world still don't belong to me.

Saturday, May 9, 1998

There had been 2 more raids in as many days, neither of them at all successful. Three more people had been lightly injured, but no one had died. The injuries had been patched up immediately by Madam Pomfrey, but she couldn't heal the gloom in the castle. The wards still hadn't been fixed, so rebuilding the castle itself was at a standstill. Instead, they were shoring up the parts that were undamaged or easily fixed, working on making that section as defensible as possible. 

Ginny and Harry had been working together on the castle and seemed happiest when they were together. Ron knew they were both worried about Hermione and Tonks and the others as well, but they had each other and they just weren't struggling the way he was. Ron was overwhelmed with frustration. Before and after every raid, he presented his plan. He explained over and over that they wouldn't get in with brute force again so soon - that it would go better with stealth this time. Taking a couple of days off probably would have helped, too, though he felt frantic to get to Hermione. He was done trying to convince his superiors. It was time to take action.

""Harry,"" Ron called, seeing his best friend up ahead, ""Headmistress Sprout asked me to come fetch you.""

They hadn't been touching before, but Ron saw Harry drag his hand along Ginny's waist as he began walking toward him. Ron rolled his eyes. He wasn't sure if they were officially together again, but they could barely stand to be apart. If it weren't his sister and best friend in question, he might have speculated that they probably weren't even separating at night, but that was too gross to consider. Ron shook the thought away.

Once they had made their way around a couple of corners and down a staircase, Ron jerked Harry aside. ""Sprout doesn't really need you, but I need to talk without my sister around. It's about Hermione and the prisoners.""

Harry had looked angry for a moment before nodding seriously when he mentioned Hermione. He knew her absence was weighing heavily on the man who considered her his sister. 

""Kingsley is never going to agree to my plan. I think I talked Remus around, but we're running out of time before Nott Sr. takes over at his Manor.""

""On our own, then?"" Harry asked.

""Almost. We'll need Bill. And Remus if he wants to go.""

""Don't you think it will be too dangerous to ask them? What if they won't do it?""

Ron looked at him for a moment before shaking his head. ""We don't have to worry about it. I know they'll both do it. Bill's been researching those wards and wants another go at them. He's going mad. He told me something. Harry, Fleur is pregnant. Just a couple of months along. Bill's falling apart not knowing if she and the baby are ok.""

Harry's mouth was in a perfect O of shock. ""We have to get her out. What about Remus? You said he was in, too?""

""He has volunteered for every attempt. He's as desperate to rescue Tonks as Bill is to get Fleur.""

""But she's more likely to be at Malfoy Manor,"" Harry stated.

""More likely doesn't mean there isn't a chance. We can talk him into it. Or we can leave him out of it. What do you think?""

Harry debated for a moment, ""Teddy may already lose one parent. Let's not be involved in making him an orphan. You said your plan works best with fewer people anyway, right?""

That was a point. Ron smiled. This was going to work perfectly. ""Let's go get Bill and finalize plans for tonight,"" he said.

**********************************

Hermione enjoyed this job. It was quiet and simple. Because she spoke some French, the old man running the place - as much an antique himself as many of the books - set her to sorting and tagging all the French and English books he had stuck in the back. She had no idea how he would ever fit them in the main part of the store, but she also wasn't sure it mattered. This was her third day here and she had never seen or heard a customer come in. When she asked, he explained that most of his business was done through owl ordering. These books were for a very special audience most of the time. 

There were moments when Hermione felt that the special audience was her. More curiously, her unusual boss came into the back the first evening to pay her and said, ""Ramenez a la maison un par jour, mademoiselle."" Then he disappeared back up front. One book per day that she could just have. From all these tomes; some practically ancient. 

That first day Hermione had a terrible time choosing but went home with a book called Charming Wands that covered wand lore, some famous wands, and charms to place on wands, which Hermione hadn't even known was possible. Her second book had been a tome on grey spells, Illumine Le Noir. She wasn't sure she agreed anymore with Harry's insistence that they use only light spells. Today, she had found a captivating book with some ancient warding techniques. She thought those might be useful to add to her repertoire and the ancient magics fascinated her. When she left the shop, her boss barely nodded at her. 

She was rushing to La Licorne Errante. She had sent out her Patronus message before she went to the bookstore earlier, this time chancing Grimmauld Place as well. Hermione had enough money today to buy dinner and take some home for Mimsy as well. Their portions were big enough that they might even get a couple of meals out of it. She preferred to stretch the money she was making since she wasn't sure what would happen next.

The hotel they had stayed the first couple of nights had been too expensive to keep with, but they had helped her find a couple down the way with a room to let. The Stodgers were thrilled to have a sweet young woman and her old gran staying. Hermione insisted to them that the single room with one large bed was plenty of space, and that she could sleep on a little sofa in the room if need be. In truth, Mimsy insisted on the sofa for herself, but at least she wasn't on the floor as she had planned. Hermione was having a very difficult time convincing her that she would be better off free.

Hermione was disappointed when she had eaten her fill and still no one she knew had appeared. She began packaging up her food when she caught sight of movement near the door. Glancing up, she tensed as she realized it was someone she knew, but not in a good way. Corban Yaxley had just walked in with a second Death Eater she didn't recognize. She had to school her breathing to keep from bolting. She reminded herself that she did not appear to be who they were looking for. As long as her glamour held, she was safe. She just needed to get out before someone hit her with a Finite Incantatum. As she finished gathering her leftovers into her bag, the two men began moving among the other patrons of the pub, swishing their wands at each of them.

Hermione stood and started toward the door. She didn't look their way, but in her peripheral vision, she could see Yaxley starting her way from across the room. ""Where do you think you're going?"" he shouted as her hand touched the door to go out. 

""Tu me parle? Je parlais Francais,"" she replied as though she didn't understand. Clearly Yaxley didn't understand her, because he looked irritated. Hermione rolled her eyes and stepped out the door...to find Dolohov and Lucius Malfoy waiting outside. She should have apparated from inside, and who cared that they would have known it was her. Now they would know and she was likely not going to make it out of here. 

""Bonsoir Messieurs,"" she said to this as though she was not being chased by their comrade and about to be taken down by them as well. She noticed Malfoy look up and down her body as she was walking away, a quiet, ""Desole de te voir aller belle dame,"" floating after her. 

Miraculously, she managed to turn the corner beyond the building before she heard Yaxley slam out the door, ""Did you get her? It has to be the mudblood!"" There was spluttering and the sound of feet dashing her way, but Hermione had already begun to spin and disapparate. 

***********************************

Harry, Ron, and Bill were crouched down outside the wards of Nott Manor underneath his invisibility cloak. It wouldn't cover all three of them completely, but the grass was tall enough here to cover their lower halves. As they got inside, one or two of them would need to disillusion themselves instead. It was dusk again. Harry felt like it was the best time for effective raids.

Bill had been working on the wards for close to an hour, gently teasing them apart. ""Done,"" he whispered, wiping sweat from his brow. 

Harry looked to Ron. The other boy nodded. Under the cover of the cloak, the three of them crept forward, Harry in the lead. They were approaching the house when they heard a low voice.

""You can stop right there,"" someone to their side said with a cocky tone.

All three moved the cloak, dropping it in their haste, so that their wands were out and shooting spells at the man. Shockingly, they all stopped several feet in front of him with no sign of where they went. 

""Do you really think I would have spoken to you without covering my arse first?"" the young man scoffed. His wand was held aloft, but he wasn't sending any spells their way. Harry took a long look at him. He looked vaguely familiar. He was about their age, tall and weedy with dark curly hair nearly as out of control as Harry's own. As they stood there, he lit up his wand with a Lumos and quipped, ""Easier to find something you like if you can see my sweet body better."" He winked at them. His eyes twinkled sapphire blue in the light.

""Who the bloody hell are you?"" Ron demanded.

""I do apologize,"" he replied, ""My manners are slipping."" He bowed aristocratically and proclaimed, ""I am Theodore Nicholas Nott, Jr., master of this manor for the moment. How may I be of service, Mr. Weasleys, Mr. Potter?""

Bill was looking around for a trap, casting diagnostics of the area, and snatching up the invisibility cloak. Ron seemed stunned. Harry wasn't at all sure what to say, but he knew he needed to say something.

""Er.....hello. We've uh....we've come to negotiate."" Harry stammered.

The man raised an eyebrow. ""Generally, negotiators come to the gate rather than slipping in through the wards. Come with me,"" he said, walking toward the manor at a casual pace, not seeming at all concerned that they might hex him. They looked at each other. Ron shrugged and Bill grudgingly nodded. Harry followed first. 

As they walked, Nott kept up a steady stream of one-sided conversation. ""I'm really quite impressed, Bill - it's ok if I call you Bill, isn't it? That double Mr. Weasley stuff is atrocious - quite impressed that you made it through my wards so quickly. You must have done some studying since you were last here. I wondered how well you might do if whoever planned the first raid at Malfoy Manor was ever allowed some more planning time. Who was that, by the way?""

""It was Ron here,"" Harry answered automatically as both Ron and Bill glared at him and Ron stomped on his foot.

The man stopped abruptly, giving Ron a thorough once over. ""Really?"" he drawled as though he hardly believed it. 

Ron's face and ears turned red. ""Yes really, since Harry already let it out. I happen to be pretty good at planning things."" 

""I've got quite the trio here, don't I?"" the man asked rhetorically. They were up to the manor now, and he flung the front door open dramatically. ""Parson!"" he shouted and a wiry elf appeared. ""Yes, Master?"" 

""Be a good lad and bring us some firewhiskey to the study."" The elf bowed and was gone.

Bill was looking around with his wand still held ready for battle. Ron was vigilant also, though Harry was mostly drawn in by Theo's monologue and the giant manor. It was a dark place: not just devoid of light, but with darkness sunk into every crevice. The furniture, even couches and chairs, were somehow grim. The art on the walls mostly consisted of nightmarish landscapes or scenes of grisly battle. Harry had to look away from the way they were moving.

Noticing the way the two redheads were on pins and needles, the young man said ""If you're worrying about the death eaters, well, the rest of the death eaters here, you needn't bother. I poisoned them all. Most of them will probably wake up tomorrow, but they're all out of our hair for tonight.""

He was so nonchalant. Harry's jaw was hanging open and he couldn't even form words. It was Ron who responded for all of them with a simple shocked, ""What!?""

""You heard me. I poisoned them. It's just us tonight.""

""What the bloody hell, Nott?"" Bill managed.

""Not Nott, please. It's a ridiculous name, really. I'm Theo."" For the first time he looked a little nervous instead of cocky. ""I mean, I'd like to be Theo. My friends call me that and I'm hoping..."" He cleared his throat, closed his eyes, and seemed to find his confidence again. ""I have a proposal for you gentleman."" 

Theo was pouring drinks as he spoke, careful to do it right in front of them and immediately take a swig of his before handing a firewhiskey to each of them. Harry didn't comment on how much Theo's hands were shaking. He, Ron, and Bill exchanged a look, silently agreeing not to drink the firewhiskey even with Theo practically chugging it in front of them. He seemed nervous again.

""Listen. I've got the keys to the dungeons, and I want to give them to you. But I've got one condition."" He was fiddling with his cup and eyeing Harry's. ""If you're not going to drink it, I will,"" he suddenly declared as he grabbed the glass away from Harry and drained it. His eyes were starting to look a little glossed over.
Bill seemed to have had enough. ""I want my wife back and I want her now. What's your condition? Quit playing with us."" He was as angry as Harry had ever seen him. 

Theo shrank away from him. It was in a child's voice that he said, ""Take me with you.""

""What? No!"" Ron cried. ""We wouldn't want your sort around.""

""Please, take me. I can be a prisoner. Whatever you want. Just don't leave me here. I already made a big mess of my rooms. It looks like there was a struggle. They'll believe you've taken me.""

""Just run off somewhere, then. Why would we take you with us?"" Ron bellowed.

Theo's lips pressed into a thin line. ""I have to fight this madness. I can't just sit on the sides somewhere and watch! And I can't just run. There are people I need to help. They want out but can't. I have more leeway since I haven't taken the mark yet. I'm not scheduled until my birthday so I've got a couple of weeks yet. I thought...I think...if I can show you all that I'm not a monster, maybe you can trust me. And maybe tonight we can start that with these."" He handed the keys to Bill and began to lead the way down into the bowels of the manor where the dungeon was located. He looked younger and nervous, not the cocky man he had been at first. The sight in the dungeon was bad. 

 

**********TRIGGER WARNING: MISCARRIAGE**************

 

The ragged prisoners turned toward the sound of people coming. ""Who's there!?"" cried a panicked voice Harry recognized as Terry Boot from the DA.

""Harry Potter and Ron and Bill Weasley,"" Harry announced as they made it to the bottom of the stairs, ""Is that you, Terry?"" he called.

""Yeah! Yeah, it's me!"" their old friend began laughing almost hysterically. They could hear voices behind him whispering and shouting and crying, ""Harry Potter! Ron Weasley! They're here to save us!""

When the torchlight revealed to them that Theo Nott was the one leading the way, there was a collective gasp. Before anything could be said, Bill was at the cell door with the keys, unlocking and rushing in.

""Beel!"" Fleur cried feebly. She had Hannah Abbott on one side and Padma Patil on the other. She was surrounded by blood. It looked like all three of them had been bathing in it. ""Beel! I 'ave lost her, I theenk. I am so sorry, 'usband."" She was sobbing into his arms, utterly heartbroken. 

""Hush, my love, hush. You're alive. We'll get you to Madam Pomfrey.""

""We did everything we could,"" Hannah said to him. ""It may not look like it, but the bleeding has stopped. Padma knew the spells to stop it.""

""But she needs blood replenishing potion soon or.."" Padma trailed off not wanting to say that his wife, too, was fading.

Harry was watching the scene in horror when Ron suddenly roared beside him and slammed Theo against the wall, ""How could you do that to her? That's my sister! That was my first niece she was carrying!"" punctuating every statement by forcing the man's head into the wall. 

""Ron!"" Harry yelled, wrenching his hands off of Theo. His curly hair was matted with blood as he slid to the ground, eyes dazed. 

A Hufflepuff walked over to them, his uniform and tie so dirty they almost couldn't tell its color. His hand lightly touched Ron's arm as he angled his body slightly protectively in front of Theo. ""I'm Jacob Finch-Fletchley. My brother's in your year and a member of Dumbledore's Army and everything. I don't remember anything much since the battle, but I do remember that bloke there telling the guards they couldn't manhandle us. He said it like it wasn't the first time he had to say it. They must have obliviated us right after we got here because I don't remember anything before that. Point is - I think he's decent enough. He would never have done that himself and he did what he could to keep the bastards in line.""

Bill had scooped up Fleur and was already halfway up the steps. Ron started herding everyone out of the cell - Hannah, Padma, Jacob, his Ravenclaw friend Matthias, and a little Slytherin boy who couldn't have been more than 12. Harry debated for a moment, then threw Theo over his shoulder. They were going to be moving quickly if they wanted to keep up with Bill. The young man moaned and probably protested, but Harry wasn't really listening. Even knowing the death eaters were supposed to be neutralized, getting out of the manor was a frightening experience for them all. Most of the captured were injured, Hannah and Matthias were having trouble walking. As soon as they moved across the wards, they began apparating everyone out.

Summary of the dark part:

Fleur likely suffered a miscarriage due to her treatment as a prisoner and may die herself. Ron blamed Theo for it and beat him up. One of the prisoners, Jacob Finch-Fletchley (Justin's brother) defended Theo. Harry takes a barely conscious Theo with him as they escape with all the prisoners.

There is a portion with warnings around it. It's fairly brief, but I will sum it up at the end for anyone who doesn't wish to read that part.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Sunday, May 10, 1998, morning

It had been 5 days. Blaise was nervous that his best friend, the one who had rescued him from the life he was supposed to lead, wasn't going to wake up this time. He had done everything he could. The anti-venom he had used was strong - one of the only brews strong enough to combat Nagini's particularly nasty venom. Draco had just been so weak already before the snake attacked. 

The repeated crucios had caused problems for everyone in the Manor. If the Dark Lord kept this up, he wasn't going to have anyone in his army who could hold a wand steady. Blaise himself had found his hands shaking for the first day or so after. He couldn't imagine how much damage the extra attacks had done to his friend's nervous system.

Then there was the beating. He hated to think it, but Draco was actually lucky. Greyback had neither raped nor bitten him - his two favorite activities with victims. Blaise had been terrified for him when Lord Voldemort handed him over to the werewolf. Still, being beaten by a gang of people was nothing to be brushed off. Draco had already been hit that morning and been out for some time, then one of the blows to his head had landed on the exact same spot. There had been so many broken bones and a rather severe concussion. Even after 5 days some of his bones were still re-growing. His head was likely still addled. Healer Blaise was glad his patient's body was taking the time it needed to heal. Friend Blaise was losing his mind. 

Narcissa wasn't helping any. She was constantly there, wringing her hands and demanding to know why he was still out. No matter how many times Blaise explained it to her, she kept asking. He was beginning to wonder if the constant stress of playing hostess here, coupled with intermittent crucios, was starting to addle her mind. He wished she would admit that Lucius was never going to leave so that they could all run for it. Yes, he and Draco had the mark, but he thought he had come up with a salve and spell combination that would help block it. There would still be pain, but it wouldn't be as excruciating. More important, the Dark Lord wouldn't be able to trace the mark's location once the salve sank in. 

Suddenly, there was a blast of dark magic and screaming from downstairs. Blaise closed his eyes, wondering what horror was happening now. He patted his friend on the arm, then got up and headed for his infirmary and lab. It was best that others didn't have reason to remember his friendship with the youngest Malfoy more than necessary. There was more screaming and he knew his services would be needed later. So he went to the lab to finish some potions and begin brewing more - they went through them so fast - and to wait on the call that the Dark Lord was done punishing for whatever reason and would allow healing now.

*****************************************

Harry wasn't sure how he felt about the Order's one and only prisoner. Kingsley had made him deposit Theo, wandless, in a room that was basically just a closet, spelling him in without letting Madam Pomfrey even know he was there. In better times, they would have sent him to the Ministry to be booked and processed for sentencing. They couldn't trust the Ministry, though, and Harry wasn't sure he would allow that to happen to Theo anyway.

For all his blustering, the young man had clearly been scared, had done his best to protect the prisoners from the other death eaters, had personally attacked those death eaters, and bargained for his life. Harry hadn't exactly given his word, but he didn't think Theo deserved Azkaban. He felt very conflicted about locking him away in a closet. Ron thought it was hilarious, but Harry was worried that they hadn't given him any medical attention first. Not that Madam Pomfrey would have had the time anyway. All of her attention and resources were going to Fleur.

Making up his mind, Harry headed back to the fourth floor corridor where Theo's closet was. No one was guarding it. It was so nondescript that he might easily have been forgotten there. Harry quickly spoke the spell to take down the wards and opened the door.

""Urrrrrgh!"" came a half-sobbed sound from the man cowered in a back corner. He had his arm over his eyes, shielding from the sudden light. ""Who is it?"" he whimpered. His knees were pulled up close to his body and he was nearly rocking back and forth. The cocky man they had first met was completely gone, dissolved into a terrified boy, shaking and crying.

""It's just Harry. I've come to see about your head."" He moved forward slowly, afraid he would spook the guy. 

His eyes now adjusted, Theo stared up at Harry. ""After, are you going to shut me back up here?"" His voice was trembling. 

""I don't know,"" Harry admitted honestly. He knew Kingsley and probably Remus, too, would skin him alive for letting Theo out, but Harry didn't know if he was willing to close him back in there seeing what it had done to him.

Theo shuddered, but then visibly tried to pull himself back together. ""So we're going with the prisoner option, eh? I signed up for that, but I guess I was hoping your side would be a little better."" His voice had begun optimistic and back to cocky, but slithered down to bitter by the end.

Harry looked at him. He wanted the Order to do better, too. He wished he had McGonagall to appeal to. Somehow he just knew she would take care of a student, no matter the side they came from. Professor - Headmistress rather - Sprout was a Hufflepuff, she should feel the same. 

""Look,"" he said as he worked on the head injury. It was fortunately just a cut that bled a lot. He was pretty sure it was not a concussion or worse. ""I want us to do better, too, but I have to get some others to agree with me first.""

Theo nodded, but Harry saw a flash of fear in his eyes. He wondered if he should ask what was bothering him so much, but determined as he got up and moved toward the door that it was really none of his business.

Just before his hand touched the door, Theo spoke in a strained voice, ""Could you give me a light? Please. I won't ask for anything else.""

Again Harry was curious and wanted to ask. Instead he just nodded and chanted, ""Murus Lumos"" and one wall began to glow. Theo practically collapsed with relief.

Harry barely heard him whisper ""Thank you"" as he closed and spelled the door shut.

 

*********************TRIGGER WARNING - MISCARRIAGE***********************

 

Severus found his skills in use again as Madam Pomfrey frantically ordered more blood replenishing potions. She was in the middle of trying to keep the Delacour girl alive and had used all she had. Thankfully, it seemed her blood levels had finally stabilized, but who knew when the next desperate emergency would rear its head. 

The castle had originally utilized a lab next to the hospital wing with a small living space beyond. Severus was working on re-opening it. He needed new quarters that didn't belong to the Headmaster or the Potions Professor. Perhaps he could find his niche here helping Poppy for now, until this blasted war was over. He couldn't spy anymore. He wasn't sure how to help keep Potter alive. It was really a miracle the boy had survived this long. 

With a sigh, he made his way into the abandoned potions lab and began setting up cauldrons. Two full cauldrons should keep them in stock for a few days at least. He needed more time to get the rest of the room in decent shape. It would take many months before his ingredient stores were fully stocked, but he looked forward to acquiring them. Next he had to head down to the main potions room for the ingredients he had to have now.

Unfortunately, he was waylaid by a Weasley just outside the hospital wing. It was the oldest, a decent potions student if he recalled correctly.

""Professor Snape! Thank you for the brewing you're doing. My wife...she wouldn't have made it without the blood potions.""

Severus wasn't sure what to do with that comment. ""It is my job,"" he finally replied. Though upon reflection, it wasn't actually, but what else would he say?

""Madam Pomfrey says she'll be ok. We can even try for another baby once she's had some time to recover."" The man was babbling and Severus didn't know how to properly show the patience he knew the situation called for. Bill, he recalled the man's name, was still going, ""I don't know how I could have gone on without her. Losing Fred has been horrible. And Mum being out for so long. Charlie still... I just needed to thank you. I know not everyone trusts you, and you can be a right git sometimes, but I appreciate you.""

Severus slowly nodded, ""You're welcome."" After a moment of thought, he added, ""And thank you,"" before turning on his heel and billowing away.

***************************END TRIGGER*****************************

""I'm telling you, this will work!"" Ron practically shouted. He was so tired of arguing with Kingsley. 

Remus had mostly accepted that he was better at strategy than they were. If anything, he seemed grateful to have one more thing off his plate. He very much wanted to be involved in any rescue attempts to get Tonks out, but he was willing to simply consult when it came to the actual planning. Some of his suggestions were very helpful. Ron had no trouble adding some experienced advice to his plans. He just wanted some respect. He had helped multiple people escape now.

His current plan was for the rescue of Professor McGonagall. She was being kept somewhere in the Crabbe household. She was supposed to be used as a maid or something similarly humiliating, but Ron couldn't quite imagine that actually being true. Because the Crabbes were one of the less wealthy pureblood families, their home was much smaller. It would also be poorly guarded, so they wouldn't need to be as careful here. The team would be small - Finian, who had been in the house many times before with Rookwood, Harry, and Ron himself. They were going to go in as a delivery wagon of cakes and other baked goods. Ron's reasoning was that it had worked with Crabbe Jr. once upon a time. His parents weren't known to be any smarter. They would let Finian go in and look around while Ron and Harry unloaded. It was a good working plan.

Kingsley was arguing, again, that they should take in a larger force. Why did it always have to be that fight? Every time they had employed those tactics, there had been an all out battle and people had gotten hurt. Not to mention that the missions hadn't been successful.

""You can agree to this or we can go on our own. It might not work the first time since we don't know where she is, but at the very least we're going to gather information and it's just going to be the three of us!"" Ron's ears and face were red. He slammed a fist down as he said it.

When Kingsley stormed away from the planning table and threw himself down behind his desk to ignore them, Ron took it as a win.

***********************************************************

Harry found Headmistress Sprout looking stressed in her office. For a split second, he worried that this would add unnecessary stress to her load. 

""Professor...er....Headmistress Sprout...""

""Yes, Harry?"" she queried, clearly not interested in listening to anyone shuffle around a point.

""Um...yes. Well, there's a student who needs your help.""

""A student?"" She pushed her hat back a little further on her head and looked carefully at the boy before her in a way that made Harry quite certain she was wondering how he could possibly be the wizarding world's savior. ""The underage students have all gone home, Harry, if they have one left to go to. Those of age are reporting to Lupin. Is this about one of the orphans?""

""No. It's...you see...he's sort of a prisoner here...""

""We don't take prisoners here.""

""I know we don't!"" Harry said, his internal compass flaring to life with renewed vigor. ""He's a student, not quite of age, and he bargained with me for the release of the prisoners at Nott Manor.""

""What!? Why have I heard nothing of this?"" Headmistress Sprout was clearly offended.

""I'm not sure, Professor. I think Kingsley didn't really know what to do with him since we don't keep people locked up here. But there are so many other important things going on. And it's not right to leave him locked in a closet.""

""They locked a student in a closet!?"" Headmistress Sprout looked as angry as the time Seamus had bitten back a Venomous Tentacula that had taken a nip at him. He had ended up in the hospital for weeks and Sprout threatened to put him in there for double that time if he ever hurt her plant again. Harry was a little taken aback and uncertain again.

He rushed after her, catching up easily, on their way to Kingsley's office. ""Erm....maybe you should want to know who the student is?""

She stopped abruptly and turned toward him with her eyes squinting unhappily. ""I can't imagine why it would matter who we've imprisoned in a closet, but go on.""

""It's, well, it's Theo Nott.""

Sprout stared at him long enough for Harry to start squirming. ""The Death Eater?"" she finally asked.

""No, no! His son, Theo. He's a Slytherin. He turns 17 soon, but he's not of age quite yet. They were waiting to mark him, you see and...""

""So he's just not old enough yet to be a real Death Eater?"" Her voice was gruff and irritated. Professor Sprout had never had much patience for foolishness.

""Yes. No!"" Harry was terrified he was going to bollocks this up for Theo. He took a deep breath, ""What I mean is... he was with them but he didn't want to be. He begged us to bring him here and offered to be a prisoner if he had to be. It was so that he wouldn't have to become a Death Eater! We didn't have to break our people out at all, Professor Sprout. He had already gotten the other Death Eater guards out of the way and gave us the keys to get everyone out. All he asked was that we let him come back with us. He wants to join the Order.""

She watched Harry for a moment before nodding and renewing her rampage toward Kingsley's office. 

 

As they burst through his office door, Ron and Lupin looked up from the table in the middle of the room. Kingsley was at his desk, looking already angry. Harry suddenly realized it might have been in his best interest to let the headmistress handle this on her own.

""There you are!"" Sprout half shouted at Kingsley, shaking her finger and heading his way. Harry was about to quietly follow in her wake when Ron gloriously interrupted. 

""Oi! Harry, I'm glad you're here. We're getting McGonagall out tomorrow and I'm going to need you for the team with me."" Ron motioned him over to the table. 

""Will you be with us, Remus?""

""Not this time,"" he said, ""I believe the two of you with Finian should be enough for this. We're not expecting major wards or even many guards. And Fin's been there many times.""

""Finian's the one you all found at Malfoy Manor, right?"" Harry queried. He still felt guilty that he hadn't been awake yet at the time. In general, Harry felt like he had failed since he didn't manage to kill Voldy. Everyone thought that would be the final battle, yet, the snake and Voldemort both still lived. The other side hadn't even lost any Death Eaters of note. Meanwhile, their side had lost Fred forever - half of the twins - and George would never be the same. Plus they had taken so many prisoners. They still didn't have a clue where Hermione was and Harry couldn't even think about that without feeling panic rise. It was almost impossible to believe they would get everyone back, and apparently they hadn't. The young Slytherin, who still wouldn't give his name to anyone, said he remembered being grabbed along with 3 others before his obliviation. There was no telling what happened to them. Meanwhile, Hermione wasn't the only one missing. No one had heard anything about Professor Flitwick either. And though they were hoping the intel on Professor McGonagall was correct, they wouldn't actually know until they got there. 

Ron broke into Harry's reverie. ""Yeah, that's the one. Good chap. We've had a pint a couple of times over at Hogs Head now. You should come with us tonight, get to know the guy a little before tomorrow.""

""Can't. I have plans with Ginny tonight. I've been too busy today to spend time with her. You know what she's like when I don't pay enough attention."" Ron rolled his eyes. He certainly did know. 

Harry was glad that, at least, he still had one of his best friends with him. And Ginny by his side as well, however stupid it was to let her make a target of herself. He turned to Ron, ""So tell me about this plan of yours.""

In the warning section, Bill thanks Snape for helping with potions. It is discussed that Fleur lost the baby but lived herself. She will be able to conceive in the future.

 

I know, the Draco part was kind of a teaser. *dodges rotten tomatoes* But now you know how he's doing. I swear you get a lot more with him on Thursday.

I think this is actually a chapter without triggers. Weird, I know. 

Hello to new readers - I feel like there are a lot since the last posting! I hope you love it. Don't be shy to let me know what you think.

As always, my beta, @highlyintelligentblonde, is amazing and much appreciated.

Unfortunately, Harry Potter still doesn't belong to me.

Monday, May 11, 1998

There was a pull in his stomach almost like the feeling of apparition but he was flying over the countryside. He was following the magic that called to him, rushing along on his broom with it stretching ever ahead of him. A beautiful song drifted back to him on the air. The magic was charming, sparkling gold, and felt like it was leading him home. It smelled of books, cinnamon, honey, and a touch of mint. There was nothing he wanted as much as to reach out and weave his hands into the magic. It danced around him, playing, teasing. But no matter how much he reached for it, he couldn't get it in his hold. He was sure it would be soft, a brush with heaven, but he couldn't move any faster toward it. 

Then it was a little further away. Since he couldn't reach for it any faster, he was losing it. He could no longer feel that sense of home inside, it was now far away and he felt afraid. He couldn't hear its music. The delightful scents of the magic were only a memory. His sight was suddenly going dark as the sparkling golden magic slipped away from him. There was a deep ache and helplessness as he suddenly realized his broom was gone and he was falling. In the background, the Dark Lord and his assembled Death Eaters were watching and laughing.

 

Draco woke up screaming. It was so abrupt that he caught Blaise completely off guard and caused his friend to give a yelp as well. Hearing voices in the hallway, Blaise reacted before his healer training could kick in, Stupefy, he knocked Draco right back out.

""What's the brat screaming for already?"" Dolohov asked with a laugh. He had flung the door open - Blaise hadn't been allowed to lock it - and was leaning against the frame with a grin. ""If he's awake, he'll have something to really scream about soon enough.""

Blaise was suddenly glad he had stunned his friend back down. It might set back his recovery, but better that than to be tortured again immediately. He might never recover from that.

""It appears he was having some sort of sleeping terror. Perhaps a memory of what happened. He's still out.""

""When will he wake up?"" Dolohov demanded.

""If I knew, I wouldn't have to babysit him so much. Please send someone to inform our illustrious hostess that her son screamed briefly. It will be my head if she doesn't know every whimper."" Blaise put on a great show of rolling his eyes and acting disgusted. He had put a lot of effort into convincing everyone that he and Draco had a falling out in their friendship some time ago, that he was only attentive because the Malfoys paid him generously to be so.

Dolohov and the other guards, lesser Death Eaters, grumbled but pulled back into the hall, dropping the door behind them. 

Blaise breathed out a sigh of relief. Informing Narcissa meant she would be here momentarily. He should probably ennervate Draco immediately, but he didn't want to until he had Draco's mother inside a muffling spell with them. His efforts to throw off the guards would do no good if she blew it by gushing about her baby being awake.

When the guards let the immaculate woman through a few minutes later, Blaise bowed to her and kissed her hand in greeting. ""Mrs. Malfoy, your son recently screamed. I believe it was a sleeping terror of some sort. It hasn't changed his diagnostics in any way.""

Narcissa looked immediately distressed. ""I had hoped it might show he is closer to waking.""

""Unfortunately, my lady, the diagnostics aren't able to tell us that. It is possible this is a sign he will be waking soon, but all we can do is wait."" Blaise was overly aware that the guards hadn't closed the doors after letting her in and were avidly listening to the conversation. With his eyes and a tiny gesture of his hand, Blaise let Narcissa know that the doors needed to be closed.

She dropped suddenly in an anguished heap on the ground, crying prettily. Blaise rushed to her side. ""I just...I can't stand to think what if he doesn't wake up, Healer Zabini!?"" she wailed. Blaise began murmuring healer nonsense about the patient until he heard snickering from the door.

Narcissa was suddenly up off the floor, her face flushed with tears, ""Antonin Dolohov!"" she screeched his name angrily. ""You will not stand in my home and make fun of my worries. He is my only son!"" She put on a beautiful show, passionate and dramatic, furious when they laughed in her face. Finally, she yelled, ""Stay out of my son's room,"" slamming the doors shut with her magic and locking them in one fell swoop. 

The wards slammed into place with the locking of the doors. Blaise added a special spell Theo had taught him, to make ""regular"" room sounds in the wards so that it wasn't obvious they were silenced. Turning to Narcissa, Blaise heaved a sigh of relief, ""He was awake."" 

She gasped, a tentative smile breaking through, ""What happened?""

""He woke screaming. When they started to burst into the room, I stunned him back down. I can't be certain what they're waiting outside his room for, but I suspect it is nothing good.""

Narcissa nodded, ""They want him blamed for Theo's disappearance.""

Blaise paled. ""I thought everyone was punished for that a couple of days ago. There were so many wounded. Drake had been out for 5 days then. How the bloody hell can it be his fault?""

""It was his idea, you know. He convinced Lucius the prisoners would be safer at Nott Manor with Theo even before his father could be there."" Her tone turned to disgust as she continued, ""Lucius told our Lord so when...it looked like he might personally be singled out for more punishment."" She choked up, ""I honestly don't know if Draco had anything to do with it or not. Lucius....he could have just said that.""

""I'm not sure what the point would have been. Drake couldn't have known the Order would get in here and have someone tell them where the other prisoners had been taken. And besides, the Order taking a prisoner can't have been his fault.""

""You know the Dark Lord still hasn't forgiven him for losing Miss Granger. And for being unable to track her down."" Narcissa looked even more worried. ""I don't believe he trusts that Draco is on his side any longer. I fear what that means for him.""

""For your whole family,"" Blaise whispered. 

Narcissa shrugged. ""I would gladly trade myself for him if he would just go.""

Blaise sighed. They were both too stubborn for that. ""It's time I try to wake him.""

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

The sky rumbled again and the rain poured down around them. Ron was pacing back and forth in front of the magical cart they had loaded and ready for their mission. Finian was trying to talk some sense into him, that this just wasn't the right time, the right conditions, to find Professor McGonagall. She was in one of the better positions as far as likelihood of being unharmed, so another day wouldn't hurt.

Harry appreciated the calm capabilities of their new member. The man was like a tranquil lake in the midst of chaos. Finian had told them that he had to be, to survive surrounded by Death Eaters. Harry felt that he must have had some natural inclination toward peacefulness to begin with, but the young man had no intention of accepting praise like that from the Chosen One. That was the one thing Harry didn't like about the guy. Fin definitely hero worshipped him, even when Harry repeatedly pointed out that Voldemort got away.

Right now, Harry knew he was distracting himself thinking about Finian. He was really as frustrated as Ron, but trying not to lose it. He had a hard time admitting to himself just how much more than a teacher Professor McGonagall was to him. It was still confusing. Was she a mother figure? A friend? Did his respect for her just make her a little more special than the other Professors? He wasn't certain. She was not someone he could justify leaving as a captive, that was for sure.

Yet, the storm was raging. No one, not even a family as stupid as the Crabbes, would believe a random bakery delivery on a day like today. They had discussed saying it was from the Dark Lord for a banquet that evening at their home, but then the servants might actually alert someone and contact other Death Eaters for confirmation. That wouldn't be helpful at all. 

Harry shook his head. ""Ron, we've got to give it up for today. You know I don't want to either, but we can't help her in this, mate. I bet you could come up with a clever storm plan, but tonight's not the right time.""

Ron glowered at him, but nodded. 

""I've got a bottle of firewhiskey in my room. Let's go have a little and forget about this day.""

Ron started to shake his head. ""Gotta make a report.""

""No, you go on with Fin,"" Harry told his best friend. ""I'll handle the report."" He wanted to spend some extra time with Ginny tonight while he had it. There were a number of information-gathering missions going on and she was supposed to be leaving on one tomorrow. Technically, he wasn't supposed to know about other people's missions, what they were doing, but he didn't know exactly. 

 

Giving the report hadn't taken long, but the dressing down from Kingsley over going to Headmistress Sprout about their prisoner problem had taken a bit longer. Harry was still glad he had tried. For the moment, the compromise the two adults in charge had come to was that Theo was locked in a perfectly nice bedroom with a proper loo and with house elves bringing his meals. There were lights he could turn on and even a few books to read. He would be ok until the next Order meeting.

Harry could be happy now with Ginny wrapped in his arms. She had flung herself at him as soon as he walked through the common room door. All the young Gryffindors, past and present, were staying there. It was made for it, after all, and the tower had been one of the first areas restored. It had fortunately not been strongly harmed. 

There were moments when Harry felt incredibly guilty about how things stood with Ginny. He kept telling her that his task wasn't complete and he couldn't let her pin her future on him until it was done. Ginny told him she would bat bogey hex him if he didn't shut up about it already. So now they were...something. They spent every spare moment together. Harry loved the innocent touches they shared, and the not-so-innocent ones they slipped in when they could get a minute alone, but those minutes were few in a castle full of peers and ever vigilant adults.

With Ron out of the room he and Harry shared, this could be a very nice chunk of alone time. Hopefully Fin would keep Ginny's brother busy for a very long time. 

Harry pulled her into the room, both of them laughing over how oblivious Ron could be. As soon as they were out of the hallway, Harry caught her laughing lips with his, darting his tongue into her mouth before she could close it in surprise. Ginny's laughter quickly turned to an appreciative hum as she kissed him back with enthusiasm.

Harry ran his hands up her sides. He loved how muscular she was despite her smaller stature. She was by no means short, but she wasn't abnormally tall and scrawny like most of her brothers, leaving Harry a good few inches taller. He felt Ginny's arms go around his neck, her hands playing in his wild hair.

As they snogged, Harry was slowly backing Ginny toward the bed when she surprised him by spinning around him, shoving him playfully down onto the bed, and throwing herself half beside him and half on top of him. Harry was absolutely not complaining. They were fighting for dominance, both laughing and pushing the other back and forth when Harry decided he was going to win this time. Still rubbing up her sides, he made sure to snag the material of her shirt and pull it up as well, almost to the bottom of her breasts. Then, completely innocently, of course, Harry's hands slid sideways. He brushed just under her breasts over and over until Ginny impatiently brought his hand under the rest of her shirt to fully hold her bare breasts. She hadn't bothered to wear a bra today. She often didn't, yet her breasts were still pert and perfect. He had a handful right now, so he was quite certain he could report that accurately.

Ginny was purring beside him, and allowed him to roll mostly on top of her. He knew she must feel how hard he was, pressing so close against her, but he wasn't even embarrassed by it anymore. She seemed to relish the feel of it, since she nudged her body harder against him there, making Harry groan. Ginny giggled in return and began kissing down his neck, feeling for the bottom of his shirt so that she could rip it off of him, which she managed moments later.

While his hand switched to her other breast, Harry's other hand trailed down to her thigh. Ginny was wearing a skirt today, which he was ready to use to his advantage. He began letting his hand slide up under her skirt until he touched her damp knickers and ran his fingers up, down, and around the growing wet patch. She was panting now, and he repeated the motions that got the biggest reaction from her. She reached down and put a hand on his aching hard cock, rubbing it through his pants. When Harry could breathe enough to do so, he hooked a finger around the side of Ginny's knickers and began to pull them to the side, his fingers stroking her slowly.

""OI! Get off my sister!"" Ron shouted as he stared at them incredulously from the doorway. 

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Draco was on his broom again. He was trying to outfly the Death Eaters chasing him. The magic was singing to him, that pathway of shimmering gold that would bring him home, but he couldn't follow it. It would be safety. It would be the best plan, the surest path of survival. But something inside him said it was no longer his path. He had to survive somehow in the darkness. He suddenly realized he couldn't see the Death Eaters anymore. He was on his broom in a nowhere of blackness. Pure dark in every direction, pulling at him, trying to eat away at what little brightness remained of him. Darkness ate everything.

 

Draco woke up panting but managed to hold back the scream. This time, too, he was able to orient himself and not get knocked back out. His eyes were greeted with the sight of his mother and best friend staring at him with worried expressions. His head was pounding and his stomach felt empty, but nothing intense enough for those expressions.

""What happened now?"" he asked. 

Narcissa and Blaise exchanged a look. ""What's the last thing you remember?"" Blaise asked.

It took Draco a minute to remember much of anything. ""Voldemort and pain, mostly,"" he responded, ""because of Granger's escape, I assume.""

""That,"" Blaise nodded, ""and the Order breaking in later that day and breaking Longbottom free.""

""He tortured me for that?"" 

""He tortured everyone for that. I even got in on that one,"" Blaise said, with Narcissa confirming as well, ""but you and Bellatrix received special punishment. And then Greyback was rewarded for catching a rogue auror. What he wanted was you.""

What little color Draco had in his cheeks drained out and his eyes were huge. He was seconds from ripping his clothes off and checking his body when his mother reassured him, ""He didn't bite you, my darling. Or do anything....repulsive,"" Blaise snorted behind her, that she could live with the Dark Lord, witness all his atrocities, and still just call rape something 'repulsive.'

Blaise cut in, ""They - Greyback and all his friends - beat you until you were a bloody pulp on the floor. I honestly didn't know if there was enough of you left to bring back, Drake.""

Narcissa was crying at the memory. Draco reached a hand out for her. Even with his pounding head, he felt well enough that it was hard to relate to what they were telling him. ""I'm feeling pretty good, Blaise. You must be getting better at this healing stuff.""

Blaise rolled his eyes. ""Learning all the time, thank you, but a solid week is helpful for that level of damage, too.""

""What!? I've been out for a week?"" Draco asked, astounded. He had a hard time healing from some of their Lord's attacks on him before, even from some of his father's more intense punishments, but he had never lost consciousness for more than a day or two at most. While he took a moment to process, Blaise began running diagnostics again. A moment later, he handed Draco a pain potion, ""For your head.""

Draco nodded his thanks, appreciating that he hadn't needed to ask. Blaise really was an excellent healer, for all that he had been awful at first. Needs had won out for him once they were thoroughly entrenched with the Death Eaters.

""Son,"" Narcissa began, ""a lot has happened in that week. Your father says it was your idea to move the prisoners to Nott Manor - a wise idea or they would have been here when the Order broke in.""

""What? I didn't say anything about what to do with them, just that I thought it was too obvious we would keep them here. I was thinking it also made them too easy to access for the Revels. They're too important to be used up that way. And when I said that, I was hoping they would take Granger away, too. That was before I had to fight those three for her.""

Blaise and Narcissa exchanged a look. ""Well, they were taken to Nott Manor, just being held by Theo and a bunch of lesser guards."" Blaise explained, his tone cautious. Draco had a feeling whatever came next was going to upset him. ""Two days ago, all the guards were found poisoned, most of them dead and the handful still alive completely unconscious.""

""No! Theo!"" Draco cried. Theo didn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. He hated the man. He could easily have fled to another country if it hadn't been for Draco and Blaise staying. ""He stayed for us, Blaise! He stayed for us and look what happened to him.""

Narcissa was trying to hush him, but Draco was nearly in hysterics at the loss of such an old and true friend. Blaise finally grabbed him by his shoulders and forced their eyes to meet. ""We don't know what happened to him. The guards were taken down and the prisoners are gone, but Theo wasn't there either. His room is wrecked, and several all around it. It looks like there was a fight, like he may have been taken. No one knows what happened. The ministry Aurors, the ones loyal to us, can't figure it out. No force seems to have been used anywhere except Theo's suite.""

Draco was taking in deep gulps of air. ""So....so you're saying he could have left instead?"" The thought hurt, but Theo had been split up from the two of them for some time. He was often sent to do nasty, cruel work. It went against Theo's intellect and his nature. Plus he hadn't been marked yet but would be soon. If he had escaped before that, fled the country like he should have in the first place, Draco was proud of him for finding the strength to go. He just wished he knew for sure.

""That's not all, Drake. The Dark Lord wants to blame you for all of it - the prisoners' escape, the dead guards, Theo missing.""

Draco dropped his head into his hands. ""I wasn't even awake for it.""

""I think that's part of the fun,"" Blaise said darkly. His voice was even lower than normal, reminding Draco of the way darkness had been ripping away at him in his dream, draining out all the color until there would be nothing but dark.

""Can we go yet, Mother?"" he asked wearily.

Narcissa looked, for the first time, like she might break. She wrung her hands before finally answering, ""You know I won't go without your father, Draco. Talk to him, man to man. He might see reason."" 

He shook his head at her. Perhaps at the beginning of this, he might have considered leaving, but Lucius was in too deep now. Draco personally thought that the man's beliefs on the matter also would have made it an impossibility then, but it was too far in the past to know. Draco's mind was whirring with things he could have done differently. In the end, though, he knew none of it had mattered. He had been marked for death since his father failed their master at the end of his fifth year. Fifth year. And this was just the end of his last year. He should be sitting for NEWTs soon, not wondering if he would live through tonight. The Dark Lord had ruined everything he thought his life could be. 

Draco almost laughed at that thought. A few short months ago, he would have blamed it all on mudbloods and everyone trying to pull the Malfoy family down. He had always been told they were wizarding royalty, that they had even consorted with muggle royals once upon a time, and only chosen to step away from them when they were sickened by their inferior ways. His father had always blamed any troubles they might have on those pathetic muggles and the mudbloods who stole away their magic and wanted to do away with all of the old magic ways. Draco suddenly found himself wondering how such inferior beings were supposed to be capable of bringing down such a powerful family as his. He shook the thought away and tried to focus on what to do now. 

""Why hasn't he just killed me already?"" Draco wondered aloud. Narcissa burst into real sobs. Blaise looked grim. Draco looked at his friend, ""It's coming isn't it?""

His low voice rumbled, ""I don't see how you can keep living through all of this. For whatever reason, he wants you to keep playing the scapegoat.""

Draco gave Blaise a long look and put his hand on his shoulder. ""I don't want you caught up in this. If they do that again, I want you to stop patching me up, Blaise.""

""Draco, NO!"" his mother cried.

""You listen to me, Mother. They're out to get me. You know they are. I'm not going to survive much longer. I don't even want to survive anymore."" He felt so empty anyway. There was a far off ache in his magic, his soul. He couldn't explain it to himself much less her. He was just tired and unable to fight anymore. He had done what he needed to do for Hermione but he couldn't go through all of this alone. He wasn't even sure what that thought meant, but it was there. ""Father will protect you and it will be easier for him without me around. I'm letting go."" Turning again to Blaise, Draco met his eyes, ""Blaise, promise me you'll get out of here once I'm gone. Find Theo and get the hell away from this war.""

Blaise set his mouth in a grim line, ""How can I...""

Draco cut him off, ""Just promise me. You can't hide that I'm awake and you know what's going to happen when you tell them.""

With a tight nod, Blaise agreed, tears in his eyes. 

""Good. Let them know I'm awake.""

My wonderful beta, @highlyintelligentblonde, is such a help and cheerleader for me on this. 

Let's see, the warnings for this chapter are sexual slavery, torture, and character death. I'm sorry, folks.

I still don't own Harry Potter.

Monday, May 11, 1998; evening

Tonks was standing next to her captor. He loved to force her to stand while he sat, but after her Auror training, it wasn't actually that difficult for her and it gave her a better view for most things. The only thing she didn't like about it, well, almost the only thing: she really hated the collar around her neck with his name engraved on it. He even had a dainty little ""leash"" on it tonight, which she found degrading and disgusting. But the only other thing she really didn't like about standing there was just that; in the gigantic dining room full of sitting people, she was easy to see. Standing out was a terrible idea in a room with old Voldy. 

She had made her hair a mousy brown, her face unremarkable. She knew there would be some form of punishment for it later. Master Rowle, as he insisted on being called despite being barely older than her, hated it when she changed to a normal face in public when all she would give him privately was the most hideous face she could manage. It delighted Tonks to irritate him that way. You had to find some fun somewhere.

There certainly wasn't going to be any of it here tonight. The Malfoys had a grand dinner out on the table, but it was nearly forgotten now. Antonin Dolohov had just come in and thrown the Malfoy scion to the floor in front of Lord Voldemort. Tonks had never met the boy who was her only cousin. It didn't look like she was going to get the opportunity before he died. He was shaking, crying, and kissing the hem of his Lord's robes. With most of the Death Eaters, that would disgust her, but this was just a kid. She felt sorry for him. 

Travers dragged his mother in now, Lucius standing to take her and bring her to her place at the table. It was interesting to watch the small confrontation when Travers refused to release her to her husband. 

""Ah, Lucius,"" Lord Voldemort addressed him, ""my slippery servant. What exactly are you trying to do?""

Lucius paled. ""I thought to seat my wife at my left hand as is proper, my lord.""

""Did you think I had not noticed your family's absence?""

""I knew you had seen it, my lord. I only hoped you might grant mercy. Our son, as you know, has been very ill. His mother has worried, perhaps more than she ought to be.""

""Indeed. So you still claim this useless brat as your son?""

""I...his mother is still quite attached to him, I'm afraid.""

The Dark Lord hummed in displeasure. ""You are so enamored with your helpless wife that you accept this man who let his own wife escape and then orchestrated the escape of many more prisoners, the death of 19 recruits, and the capture or death of the sole heir of Nott house?"" 

The Malfoy boy laying on the floor was panting. Tonks recognized signs of a panic attack, but there was nothing to be done for him. He seemed to be fighting it as well as he could. She was relatively certain he had no say in any of what he had just been accused of. 

Before Lord Malfoy could respond, there was a soft bark of laughter from the back. Tonks realized it was Nott, Sr. speaking, ""Good riddance to the useless, snivelling wretch. Wouldn't have ever wanted him representing Nott house anyway. I'll need a wife to make a new whelp, but that can easily be found.""

Lord Voldemort laughed at that, ""Perhaps you should talk to Parkinson. I believe he had a rebellious daughter to get rid of."" Everyone laughed before the Dark Lord went on, ""Now, Lucius, I would hear your answer.""

The man who used to seem so commanding almost shrunk in on himself, ""My lord, since his wife did escape, I'm still without an heir.""

Lord Voldemort angrily replied. ""Again, Lucius, dead men don't need heirs. Who would you have me torture and kill tonight - the brat or your dear Narcissa?""

Lucius looked stricken. All color drained out of him and he closed his eyes before saying, ""Draco. Kill him. He is my son no longer."" The boy on the floor whimpered, but Tonks could see his liquid silver eyes and could tell he had already known this was coming.

""I'm so glad you've finally made a choice, my servant. Sit down so you may watch with the others."" Turning back to his meal, he called, ""Dolohov, get that garbage out of my sight, down near the end of the table somewhere,"" Lord Voldemort indicated young Draco. ""Travers, bring Narcissa here. I think it is high time we be done with this little family.""

""No!"" Draco let out an anguished cry as Dolohov began dragging him across the tiled floor, ""Lucius said me! Torture me. Kill me! Leave mother alone! Please!""

The Dark Lord laughed, cast crucio on Narcissa, and began eating his dinner. ""Someone silence the garbage,"" he mentioned casually, as though it were normal dinner conversation.

Tonks was sickened that everyone began eating dinner while Narcissa screamed on the floor next to Voldemort. She wondered if he intended to torture her into complete insanity like the Longbottoms. After he chewed a few slow bites, though, he let up and she collapsed crying on the floor. Lucius started to stand, but the Dark Lord pinned him with his beady red eyes. ""She is no longer your concern, Lucius."" He turned to his right and began talking softly with Rodolphus and Bellatrix. Tonks felt sickened. Nothing good could come of that.

Looking at Bellatrix brought a sudden jolt of recognition. On the floor next to her was a muscular young man with curly red hair, completely nude, with a collar much more elaborate than the one Tonks was forced to wear. She knew Charlie Weasley anywhere. She hadn't known he was a prisoner here, too. Or maybe she had known at some point before her latest obliviation. Who knew? She wasn't even sure how long she had been here. She wondered if they had been together when they were captured or if her old friend had been here even longer than she had. They had been in the same year at Hogwarts. She had even had a crush on him at one time. And sweet Merlin he was worthy of a crush now. I may be married, but I have eyes, she thought. Still, Tonks felt dirty looking at him considering how many of the Death Eaters within view of him were leering - male and female alike. It gave her chills to see how exposed he was.

She lost her train of thought as Bellatrix stood from the table. She picked something up and placed it in Charlie's mouth. Tonks had to strain to hear her command, ""Come, my pet, I have a job to do and you will assist me."" When she yanked on the chain leading to his collar, he had no choice but to follow, on all fours, or be dragged across the floor by his neck. 

Bellatrix practically danced over to the heap on the floor that was her little sister. She walked around her speculatively. ""Who would have ever believed you would become a blood traitor, Cissy? Mother and Father would be disgusted by you. All for the love of your precious little son,"" she mocked.

Turning to Charlie, she said, ""Stand and give me the knife, pet."" He very carefully stood up and put his head forward so she could take it from his mouth. ""Isn't it nice for one blood traitor to help me torture another?"" The room exploded in laughter. To Charlie she said, ""Now, back up a bit, lace your hands behind your neck, and feet apart."" He closed his eyes, his cheeks flaming, but obeyed. ""Eyes open!"" she snapped at him. She kicked his feet a little farther apart, then turned to her sister and ignored him.

Giggling, she began running the knife over her sister, carving words into her body. Narcissa's screams were even more pained than they had been under the cruciatus. At the back of the table, there was a commotion. Goyle, Sr was restraining the youngest Malfoy as he tried to fight through and get to her.

Lucius suddenly could take no more and stood up. ""My lord, please! Cissy is not a blood traitor. She did nothing wrong. It was all that boy! Torture him this way, but let me take my wife up to her bed before this gets any more out of hand.""

Lord Voldemort laughed, ""Oh Lucius. This is far out of your hands."" He motioned to Travers and Rookwood, both sitting nearby. They stood and grabbed Lucius by the arms, pulling him forward. ""Goyle, please bring the garbage back up here."" Tonks felt dread pooling in her belly. This was going to be the end for the Malfoys, for sure. Bellatrix was still gleefully cutting up her sister. Both Malfoy men had been taken up close enough to see exactly what was happening to Narcissa, but not close enough to do anything about it.

The Dark Lord smiled at them both, an evil smirk on his face. He asked, ""Draco, my boy, would you like for your mother to live?"" He waved his hand to allow the boy to speak.

""Yes, my lord. Please. I'll do anything you want me...""

""Shut up! Your snivelling offends my ears,"" he said. Grinning around at his Death Eaters, he looked to Goyle who was still holding Draco back. ""Goyle, give the boy your wand and let him go."" 

Everyone reacted with shock. Everything was suddenly silent except for Narcissa's tapering screams. Bellatrix had stopped her ministrations for the moment, watching this new scene unfold. Goyle reluctantly let go of the boy and handed him his wand. Draco took it gingerly, but seemed to acclimate to it without too much trouble. Still, Tonks could see his true emotions by the way the wand was shaking. Whatever Voldemort was about to ask of him would undoubtedly be harsh. 

""Now. All you have to do to keep your mother alive is to kill Lucius. It doesn't even have to be through torture. Just avada him. Right now.""

Draco turned to his father. He looked completely lost for a moment, tears running down his cheeks. Then he took a look at his mother, laying at her sister's feet and viciously shaking her head no. Draco closed his eyes for a long moment. When he opened them, the liquid silver had been replaced by steel grey. He brought his wand arm up steadily. His mother screamed, ""No, Draco! He is your father. Let me die instead!"" but he ignored her, staring at Lucius. 

His father glared at him, ""Don't you dare. You've never been more than a useless brat. I know you can't kill your own father.""

""You are no father of mine. Avada Kedavra.""

As soon as the deed was done, the wand clattered to the floor. The boy was shaking like a leaf. Tonks couldn't imagine what that had done to him. 

Narcissa was screaming, ""NOOOO! You monster! You killed your own father, you...you evil piece of trash. You are not my son!"" Her words dissolved into an anguished wailing, crying Lucius' name over and over.

Tonks hadn't thought she could be shocked by anything that happened here, but the words Narcissa had just spoken and the utter devastation on young Draco's face had done it.

Voldemort, finished with his meal, stood up. ""Lord Malfoy,"" he addressed Draco, ""Take your seat at the table and eat your dinner like a good little boy. If you would like for your mother to continue living, you will not move from that spot or say one word until you are given permission."" The seat he indicated had been the boy's father's. The half-eaten plate of food had been piled high by his father. He had to walk past his father's body to get there. Tonks could see him shuddering, trying to hold back a sob. 

""Now, Narcissa. It appears you are no longer the lady of this fine house. I'm not sure what use you could be to me. Perhaps someone else, someone like Fenrir, might have ideas about what to do with you."" Narcissa was weeping so hard for her dead husband that she didn't even react to that suggestion. Draco did, jerking his eyes up to their Lord, but his mother didn't seem to care. Voldy looked a little ticked off about that. She was clearly supposed to be frightened. Disgruntled, the Dark Lord looked down the table, ""Dolohov. You have been a loyal servant. Would you like a wife?""

The man had a wicked smile. ""Of course, my Lord, if you see fit to give me one.""

""Will you take her even though she is a marked blood traitor? Will you beat that out of her? Control her properly?""

""Oh yes, my Lord.""

Tonks observed the utterly stunned expression of Narcissa's son. He was barely holding himself together. She could tell he had somehow thought that if he did what the Dark Lord wanted, he and his mother could continue the lives they had led. He hadn't thought through the implications of what Voldemort might do with them.

""We shall have your wedding in 3 days, to give you both time to prepare."" Lord Voldemort laughed. ""Now, Lord Malfoy...."" he got no further because Bellatrix was cackling behind him, approaching her ""pet"" with the knife to begin carving into him. Charlie's face was set, his mouth in a determined line. Tonks knew him. He would not move or cry out if he could stand it.

Surprisingly, the Dark Lord's voice rang out, ""No, my Bellatrix darling."" 

The deranged witch turned to stare at him with rounded eyes. 

""That is a tasty morsel you have there and if you're going to blemish it, I'll have to give it to someone else."" The Dark Lord began walking toward the little scene.

Tonks felt herself bristle at him referring to her friend as though he were an object instead of a person, but she knew if that and embarrassment were the worst things that happened to him tonight, Charlie would be very lucky. She shuddered for him when Voldemort walked up to the man and ran his fingers all the way down his body. To his credit, Charlie didn't move, didn't even flinch. ""A very impressive specimen,"" the Dark Lord stated with a disturbing smile. As he moved back toward Draco, Tonks noticed the look Bellatrix gave her pet. Charlie would pay for that, but at least whatever she did to him couldn't leave permanent ""blemishes.""

""Mr. Malfoy,"" Voldemort went on, ""I have a way for you to rejoin my ranks at a beginner's standing. After the wedding, you will reset the wards on this manor. You will hand them over to me and then I will allow you among my Death Eaters once more. Until then, Goyle - lock the brat in his room. Draco, dear, while she no longer claims you as her son, do remember that your mother will pay for anything that doesn't please me.""

Goyle hustled the boy out. Tonks hoped that was all the entertainment for the evening. She had seen as much as she thought she could handle. As she watched the front for any more drama, Charlie suddenly looked up and met her eyes. He blushed again, but gave a slight nod. He knew she was there, too. Neither of them were alone in this.

Thorfinn picked that moment to jerk on her leash. Tonks met his eyes. She wasn't very good at the submissive, eyes on the ground thing. He looked furious. He had undoubtedly seen her looking at Charlie and misinterpreted it. Rowle had been a few years ahead of them at Hogwarts. He had always wanted Tonks, and had always been jealous of her entourage of friends, especially the male ones. This night was going to be far longer than she wanted it to be. She just had to keep going. Somewhere out there, she knew Teddy was with her mother and hopefully Remus too. There had to be a way out of this eventually. She just had to hold on until then and try to stay out of Voldy's sight.

Trigger Warnings: Torture

 

I still don't own Harry Potter.

Thursday, May 13, 1998; morning

Ron was irritated. It had been days since the last meeting, the longest gap since the Battle of Hogwarts, and there was still so much to accomplish. There had been some terrible weather to endure, then a couple of intense days of funerals. Fred's had been the first morning so that Ginny could leave directly afterward on some sort of covert mission. Ron wasn't privy to those. He had been too busy with the funerals, a task he found useless but somehow necessary for most. The bodies needed to go into the ground, too. They couldn't be held in stasis forever. Or maybe they could, but he didn't want to contemplate it. So he made time for funerals.

There were so many things they didn't have time for as it was. They still hadn't managed the mission to rescue McGonagall and Tonks, Charlie, and Hermione were still in Death Eater hands. Ron felt stir crazy just sitting around watching people say goodbye to their loved ones knowing that the longer they waited the more funerals there would be. Now they were finally in a meeting but everyone was just wasting time arguing over what to do with the stupid Death Eater. The weedy boy with his wavy, dark brown hair and sapphire eyes was standing at the front of the room looking bored as everyone's hate hit him and just rolled off.           

""He can live in my chambers,"" Snape offered. That just caused another uproar. Just because Voldy tried to kill him, didn't make him a good guy. Ron was sick of people trying to make excuses for the biggest bully the Hogwarts schoolchildren had to deal with everyday. Plus he was a Death Eater and Dumbledore's murderer.

""Why don't they live together in a cell? Goyle, too,"" Ron called out. Everywhere around him, people spoke in agreement. Only Harry turned to give him a harsh look. Ron didn't get why Harry had such a soft spot for these gits. So Snape had loved his mum and been a double agent all that time. He still treated Harry like dung all through school. And that Theo - he had handed over the prisoners and himself, but he was up to something. He was a Slytherin and this was war. They couldn't afford to risk trusting him. Ron wanted them all locked up and he wanted Harry to stop trying to help them while their own people suffered. 

Kingsley cleared his throat and waited for quiet. ""I am aware that their previous affiliations make them suspect, but they have each done things to redeem themselves and have made a pledge to the Order. In good conscience, I cannot lock them up. I do agree that our headquarters is perhaps not the best place for them, but other arrangements have not been possible yet.""

""Why can't they just keep to their rooms until there's some other place to put them?"" Seamus asked.

""Because I want to do something to help,"" Theo broke in. It was the first thing he had said since he arrived. He shoved his hands into his pockets after he said it. Ron had a feeling it was so that he didn't fidget. Hard to maintain the cool facade if you're nervous.

Remus spoke then, his voice hard, ""What do you know of the other prisoners? Where is my wife?""

Theo blanched and swallowed hard. ""I don't know. I was already on my way home when she was taken prisoner. They're not big on communication with underlings."" Remus looked ready to jump across the table at him. 

""You expect us to believe that the heir to one of the sacred twenty-eight is an underling?"" Ron snarled. He couldn't believe they were letting this piece of trash talk.

Theo looked angry. ""You know nothing of me except my title. I can't keep you from judging me on it, but I will take veritaserum if you need to verify that I know nothing about Lady Lupin.""

Despite the gravity of the situation, there was a smattering of laughter around the room. No one had ever called Tonks by Remus' last name. And the thought of her as a Lady was hilarious.

Ron was irate that they weren't focusing. ""Where's Hermione?"" he demanded. 

Surprisingly, Theo was suddenly hiding behind his blank, bored face again. ""She's not there. I don't know where she is.""

""Do you mean whoever she was given to took her home?"" Ron practically spat the words. Theo's mouth went into a firm line and he didn't answer.

Harry was the one who spoke up. ""Wait! Someone had escaped earlier that day. It was her, wasn't it?""

Theo looked conflicted for a moment before inclining his head. ""I cannot be sure, but I believe so. I was out of the manor by then.""

""Why would you tell us she's not there if you aren't sure?"" Harry asked with some confusion and a hint of doubt.

Theo stumbled over his words. ""I...I know who she was given to, and I know there was a plan to get her out.""

""Then where is she?"" Ron shouted. He was done with this. ""Why isn't she here?""

""I don't know,"" Theo responded. ""Does she know where 'here' is? The prisoners were kept in the dark. The Dark Lord doesn't want anyone remembering anything about headquarters or how they got there. All the prisoners and some of the guards are obliviated regularly. The last thing she would remember might be the battle itself. She wouldn't even know how it ended.""

There was silence as the entire room absorbed that. 

""You know I didn't remember all that much and I had been there far longer,"" a new voice said - Finian. The muggleborn had been with the Death Eaters for a couple of years before the raid. He was only able to tell them what had happened since that morning because there must have been some sort of Revel the night before. It had been pure luck that Crabbe had a gleeful conversation about taking McGonagall home to be his wife's maid right in front of Fin that very morning. ""Even if this Hermione felt like she could go to St. Mungo's or wherever to get her memories back, the repeated memory charms make it nearly impossible to get anything back without losing your mind. At least that's what the healer lady told me."" He nodded to Madam Pomfrey and she silently agreed with him.

Harry stood, ""We have to find her! We should check the places she would know - Grimmauld, the Burrow, Shell Cottage, maybe some of the places we camped this last year."" He started to head for the door when Mr. Weasley caught his arm. 

""Son, you can't just go running off looking for a kettle in a haystack. Grimmauld Place is compromised. The Burrow is still a burnt out shell. The cottage might be a real possibility and I think Fleur is nearly ready to travel home anyway. Let her and Bill check there when they go.""

Remus added, ""Hermione is smart, probably smarter than anyone here. She'll find a way to contact or find us. If she hasn't yet, then we must assume she is being cautious for a reason.""

Harry still looked like he might rush out the door. ""Let's send her a patronus."" He brandished his wand and called out his stag.

""No!"" Mr. Weasley said, pulling the boy's wand arm down. ""Harry, she may be with muggles or somewhere in danger.""

The stag evaporated, and Harry sunk into a chair between the Weasley parents. Molly had moved over so she could hug him as he sniffled. Ron knew Harry was beside himself about the girl he considered a sister.

Trying to get the meeting back on track, Ron called out, ""So what are we doing with the Death Eater git? We've got more important things to talk about.""

Kingsley looked conflicted for a second, then leveled his resolution. ""The two boys in question, Theodore Nott, Jr. and Gregory Goyle, Jr, will be placed back in their rooms and locked in until we are able to move them to a safe house. Severus Snape will also...""

""No,"" a quiet voice interrupted. Everyone gasped that Madam Pomfrey had spoken in a meeting. She never ventured opinions unless asked and never interrupted the powers in the room. ""No. I need Severus to help with all the potions. There is a lab directly off the hospital wing with its own living quarters. We have been setting it up for him. I will not have him locked away when we have use for him. The Goyle boy, too, has been very helpful. But I will be content with Severus if you seriously believe the child must be punished.""

It was quiet for a moment before Kingsley asked, ""Are you willing then, Poppy, to be responsible for Snape?"" 

""Of course."" Her tone made it clear he was being ridiculous.

Kingsley nodded and motioned for Theo to have a seat next to his former potions professor and sole Slytherin friend.

""With that settled,"" Kingsley continued, ""we need to discuss the continued rebuilding of the castle."" Many voices agreed. The small portion that was put back together was getting crowded. They needed to expand, not to mention the mental relief of having the castle whole again.

Headmistress Sprout stood, ""It's more complicated than just building,"" she stated matter-of-factly. ""When the founders built the castle, they wove wards into its very structure. To maintain and even upgrade the security here, we believe this needs to be done once more. We just have to figure out how.""

""We need Hermione,"" Ron muttered. Harry's face fell as he nodded. How were they going to make it through this all without her?

""You know I have experience with warding, though never quite like this,"" Bill said. ""It might help for me to look at some of the walls that are intact.""

""That's a good idea,"" Kingsley agreed. ""Does anyone else have particular experience with wards?""

No one spoke for a moment, until a tentative voice spoke out, ""Wards are something of a specialty of mine.""

Everyone turned to look. There were several gasps when people began to realize it was Theo who had offered. 

""Bloody hell!"" Ron fumed, ""No one would trust a ward that arsehole made, even if he could do it."" The room broke out in chatter as most everyone agreed with Ron while a handful argued back - Harry, of course, and Luna as well as a few others.

With his calm but carrying voice, Remus broke through the chaos, ""I think it would be best if Bill handles this alone until some additional expert is found.""

""I will of course continue to look at the founders' journals and consult with Headmaster Dumbledore's portrait. I have faith we will find the safest way forward.""

Before anyone could comment, Kingsley moved on, ""The next order of business is that we have a new tactician in charge of raids and battle plans.""

Ron felt fury rage through him again. How dare they go and find someone else to mess everything up!? His entire body was turning so red it was almost purple when Kingsley continued, ""Ronald Weasley is now the General of our army, such that it is."" Ron was stunned. His mouth hung open as the people around him patted his shoulders and cheered for him. 

""Now,"" Kingsley said smoothly, ""I need everyone to leave the room, it's time for General Weasley and I to go over the upcoming raids and plans.""

Thursday, May 13, 1998; evening

Hermione dropped onto the bed in their tent, utterly exhausted. It had been five days since the Death Eaters found her in Paris. After two more close calls in small villages, she had retreated to the Forest of Dean and set up camp. It felt odd to be in the tent without her boys. It felt even odder to have Mimsy constantly fussing over her when she was home, making mint tea and a variety of soups. It seemed the little elf could make a gourmet soup out of literally anything Hermione brought home. 

During each day, she was picking up work here and there. Since they weren't staying in hotels, it wasn't strictly necessary and perhaps risky, but she had to scope out bars to meet in and staying in the tent all day would drive her mad. Today, Hermione had worked in Lydney at a little pub called Nags Head Inn. She had glamoured herself as a buxom blond and walked away with quite a bit more money in her pocket than usual. She would have to remember that trick. The downside was that she wanted nothing more than to go to bed immediately. She didn't know why she was so exhausted all the time these days. 

She couldn't yet head off to bed. There was the nightly ritual of hoping to meet someone. Under a different glamour, she would be traveling back to the Nags Head. It was quite dark inside and had a number of exits. She liked her odds of escape there if the worst happened again. She wished she had her old DA galleon. She had thought it would be in her beaded bag somewhere, but if it was, she couldn't find it. She needed some new way to contact the Order. Until she could think of one, though, she was stuck with the daily Patronus. The Death Eaters were obviously intercepting one of them, but she didn't know what else to do. Today she had gone back to just the Burrow and Shell Cottage. Her suspicion was that Grimmauld Place was the one most likely to be filled with dark wizards.

While she couldn't prove that her suspicion was true, the witch with short black hair and blue eyes was pleased to find herself only among friendly strangers that night. She stayed quite later than she meant to, fascinated by the book of wand lore she had gained in Paris, before giving up on the Order.

Of course, Mimsy fussed when Hermione returned home. ""Mistress Hermione, you bes so late! Mimsy was worried! What would Master say if Mimsy loses you?""
Hermione rolled her eyes. It was maddening that she could get absolutely no information from the elf about who this mysterious master was. 

""I can take care of myself,"" she said, trying to be gentle and understanding. The house elf was growing on her more each day. As loathe as she was to admit it, Mimsy obviously did have a mind of her own and had clearly made her choice. She was the worst 'slave' one could imagine. At least half the time she outright disobeyed any order Hermione gave. She couldn't quite figure out if it was because the Master still held strings to her or if Mimsy would have treated him the same. Although she didn't know, some part of her suspected the latter. Mimsy meant business when she decided how things were going to be. She had quite taken over the organization of the tent as well as all cooking, cleaning, and mending. To be honest, Hermione couldn't bring herself to care. She was just glad to slide into the beautifully made bed and sleep rather than having to pack up in record time and apparate somewhere else. 

Maybe tomorrow she would finally make contact with her friends. She missed them all, but Harry most of all. She was surprised it wasn't Ron she missed most, but she and Harry had grown even closer when Ron ran out on them. She might have feelings for Ron, but they weren't as strong as the bond she and Harry shared. She missed curling up together to sleep, keeping each others' nightmares at bay and sometimes talking into the night. There were no weird tensions between them anymore, just comfort. She needed that back. And fun nights hanging out with Ginny and Luna. She wanted to see all of the Weasleys. Neville. Her professors. Basically all the people who had a place in her heart. All she could do was hope and keep going. She was almost asleep, thinking of her loved ones, when she felt a sudden desperate tug on her magic.

*******************Trigger Warning: Torture**********************

Draco was in a state of shock. He couldn't make sense of the world, of his life. His mother was remarried. His father was dead, killed by his own hand, and his mother was now married to someone who despised her and wanted her to pay for whatever slights he imagined. His mother, marred by her sister's knife, just like his own wife was, hated him. He couldn't wrap his head around it. No matter how many times his head repeated these facts, he couldn't understand them. 

Moving to do Lord Voldemort's bidding was just another part of putting one foot in front of the other and doing as told. Blaise had tried to talk to him earlier, something about leaving, about the master killing him as soon as the blood wards were turned over to him. Draco hadn't really been able to hear or understand the words Blaise was saying. He told the healer he thought his ears needed healing, that they weren't working right. Blaise had shaken him and stormed off muttering about fools. Draco wasn't sure in his current state, but he rather thought that wasn't the professional healer's way of dealing with deafness.

""Lord Malfoy,"" Voldemort mocked, ""Take down your blood wards and hand them to me. I will drip my blood on them and we will put them back together, with you as the lesser occupant here.""

Draco nodded. Something in the back of his head warned this was a terrible idea, but he didn't really care. He wasn't completely sure he knew how to do what his Lord wanted him to do anyway, but he would try. He looked down at his right hand - that would have been the preferred - but there was a scar there. Something inside him said it was important and not to be used for this. So he didn't. Draco made a cut on his left palm and began dripping his blood along the ward lines. They were at the keystone of the gates, the apex of all the ley lines in the area. Covering it in his blood would spread throughout all the wards. Some brilliant ancestor of his had come up with this to avoid having to drip blood all over the entire property. 

When the keystone was literally covered in his blood, he began to chant and weave with his wand, undoing the complicated wards to the best of his ability. Between the shock he was already in and the loss of quite a lot of blood, Draco was only able to unlock them to a point. With a sense of fatality, he turned to Lord Voldemort and forced the words from his lips.

""I am sorry, my Lord. I don't know what else to do.""

The Dark Lord actually stared at him, taken aback for a moment. ""You don't know how to work the wards to your own home?"" he asked incredulously.

Draco blushed with shame but replied, ""My father hadn't taught me. I'm not even sure he knew all of it. He always hired curse breakers to come in and take care of it when something needed to change."" 

There was a silent pause. Draco said, ""If you can guide me through what to do, master, I am willing, just ignorant.""

As it turned out, the Dark Lord apparently didn't know that much about the blood wards there either. After a few tries to rid the wards of their Malfoy ties, Lord Voldemort impatiently sliced his own hand, letting his blood join what was already on the keystone. He was pleased that this meant he could no longer be kept in or out of the wards, and that when he sent guards to test the wards, they could not. He was not at all pleased that he couldn't change anything about the wards and that Draco still appeared to be Lord of the Manor.

""I should kill you now,"" he told the boy.

Draco shrugged, ""But then you would never get the wards to work. I didn't get my heir yet. I'm the last Malfoy.""

""How dare you defy me!"" Lord Voldemort hissed at him.

""I don't even want the place,"" Draco said in a voice barely above a whisper. He couldn't bring himself to care enough to say the right, safe things.

""Crucio! Crucio! Crucio!!!"" That was just the beginning. There were slicing hexes, bruising hexes applied to his organs, something that squeezed and shattered his bones, one at a time. The Dark Lord continued raining horrors down on Draco until he was broken, bleeding, and barely breathing. 

""My Lord! Please let me work on him,"" Blaise cut in, his dark rolling voice a little higher in panic, ""I don't believe he will survive another spell of any sort.""

""You care that I might kill him, Healer Zabini?"" Voldemort's beady eyes were practically glowing red. 

""If I may, my Lord, your purpose was to secure the blood wards. Without a warding expert, you need his blood in his living body."" It took everything Blaise had inside not to show his immense concern for his friend. 

Draco was only conscious because he hadn't been allowed to slip into darkness. Lord Voldemort wanted no reprieve for his senses as he ripped the boy's body apart. He was panting at their feet, no longer able to scream. Even with Blaise interceding, he knew he might not live through this. His body was so broken that he might have been living on magic alone. When he felt a sudden kick to his stomach, he realized he had run out of that, as well. He felt like his mind, pinned to consciousness by Lord Voldemort's magic, was falling into a dark, aching pit of blackness and despair. 

""Is this death?"" he thought, hoping he might be released to it. But then he was distracted - something golden and shimmery was catching him, like a net, a blanket of warmth around him. It cut the ties the Dark Lord had bound him with, leaving Draco's body unconscious on the ground, but still breathing.

The Dark Lord stormed back toward the manor house, giving no instructions about the limp body behind him. When he was far enough away, Blaise levitated Draco along a garden path and in a back door headed for his infirmary. If it were up to him, his friend wouldn't be living in his room any longer. It was too accessible. They needed Draco to disappear as much as possible. Perhaps Lord Voldemort would find someone new to scapegoat.

The last segment, with Charlie, is hard to read. Seriously. Bellatrix is so freaking squicky. Read at your own risk. Stuff happens that's important to the plot later, but I'll summarize it at the end. 

 

Thank you, thank you to @omnenomnom who helped me work through the last part of this one and made it less squicky than it originally was. And a thank you to @highlyintelligentblonde as well for her beta work.

The world and characters still belong to Rowling.

Friday, May 14, 1998; midday

It had been four days in the field now. The first three had been very wet. Ginny had holed up in the cabin they provided for her even though it was falling in. On first sight, she had assumed it was a magical building, charmed to look decrepit so no one would pay any attention to it. Unfortunately, it was the real deal. At least it had been well provisioned. She had plenty of cans of food, and a warming charm made them decent enough. There were even enough blankets to keep her warm if it hadn't been for the leaks. She would have to let Remus know. He was still coordinating all of the safe houses and information gathering runs. 

That was what she was supposedly doing. There was a spy among the Death Eaters. A kilometer away from the cabin, there was a drop point for information. Sunday night was when the spy was supposed to drop a new packet. Ginny's job was simply to go pick it up once the chime in the cabin sounded. She wasn't entirely certain why they couldn't wait in, say, a pub and have some other item chime when the drop point was accessed, but her role in all this was to follow orders.

The drop point had yet to be tripped. She was supposed to wait up to a week if necessary, though they had assured her that this drop had never been more than a day late. She definitely had not brought enough with her to do for so long on her own. She couldn't fly, her favorite activity. The thought of keeping a journal made her ill. She had brought a book to read, but finished it already. It had been about one of her Quidditch idols, fascinating but not a long read. She had been making progressively more difficult goalposts for herself around the cabin and tossing a ball of paper through over and over again. It wasn't a quaffle, but it was better than doing nothing.

Even with that, Ginny was sure she would go mad if something didn't happen soon. She was preparing a can of muggle soup that honestly looked like someone had been sick when the chime finally sounded. With relief, she vanished the mess she had been heating and rushed about getting ready.

She had to be careful. If the Death Eater lingered, or had been followed, there could be a fight. That it was so many days past the planned time suggested that the person had a hard time getting away from others, so the potential danger was greater. 

It was almost midday. She had expected to collect the information after dark. The clothing she had packed was dark so that she could move unnoticed at night. It was logical, but not great for the middle of the day. She perhaps should wait until evening, but she couldn't stand it. With a quick glamour spell, she changed her current outfit to green and brown so that it would blend better in the daytime woods.

She kept her wand out and her eyes alert as she walked to the drop point. When she arrived, she spent a good half hour observing before she moved forward and placed her hand inside the hollowed out tree. She made contact with what felt like a bound packet of papers. Smiling, she was finally able to apparate away with her mission complete.

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

Harry and Ron were sitting at the front of a delivery wagon filled with sweets. It was an utterly ridiculous plan in some ways, but Finian agreed the elder Crabbes were just as stupid as their son had been, so just as likely to fall for sweets from nowhere. He had laughed uproariously when they told him their story of drugging the young Crabbe and his friend Goyle by floating cupcakes filled with sleeping potion right in front of them. Ironically, they were taking swigs of polyjuice potion as they told the tale.

The guards at the front gate passed them through with only a cursory examination of the wagonload. When they came to the house, Finian pulled them to the kitchen entrance. 

""What's this?"" shouted a giant woman in an apron. She was clearly a cook. ""We didn't order no baked goods.""

""The Dark Lord sent them, my lady,"" Ron said with a wink. The fellow whose hair he had used was a very attractive bloke.

""And why would he be sending them here?"" she quizzed, looking dubious.

""Don't rightly know,"" Finian replied. ""We're just following orders, ma'am."" He looked like a common down-to-earth worker, nothing worth looking at, easily forgettable. ""Come take a look at all this. I think he must be planning a feast here soon.""

The cook looked a little disturbed. 

""Can we start bringing it in for you, Miss?"" Harry asked.

""Yes, yes,"" she replied, ""Hurry it up. I don't have time to fuss over it."" She immediately began barking orders to the others inside. The kitchen was a whirlwind of activity at a moment's notice. 

 

Finian took the first load in. The plan was that he would go deeper into the house to search for Professor McGonagall while the two of them kept going in and out with cakes and things. If all went well, he would soon be out with her and they would hide her in the back of the wagon to leave. It went flawlessly. He found the professor polishing silver in the dining room off the kitchen. 

""Minerva McGonagall?"" Finian spoke softly.

She blinked at him. ""Yes, young man?""

""I'm Fin. We're here to get you back to the Order. Harry and Ron are in the kitchen for us. Come on,"" he whispered, and grabbed at her wrist. One look over the rim of her glasses and he immediately dropped her wrist, looking chastised. ""Sorry ma'am.""

She nodded at him and rose from the chair, carefully placing the silverware back in its box.

 

Harry was relieved to see Fin reenter the kitchen with a tray of goodies, but coming from what was presumably the dining hall. He was walking slowly. Harry hoped that meant he had found Professor McGonagall and she was following under Harry's cloak. Their path was complicated as people kept stepping in the way. Harry wondered how the elderly Professor was managing the fancy footwork that would be necessary to keep from bumping into anyone. She was following Fin out the door when one of the kitchen workers ran right into nothing, the pudding they had been carrying splattering all over the area, including a cloaked figure that could now be seen outlined in pudding. Several workers shrieked and began blubbering about ghosts, but the cook yelled, ""Where do you think you're going!? PRISONER ESCAPE!"" With a quick wand swish, sparks went up. The kitchen suddenly erupted into chaos as everyone turned to stop the prisoner and her rescuers.

Harry tossed the pie he had been carrying directly into the face of one of the kitchen helpers and rushed to the door, only to find there were Death Eaters pouring through it toward him. Glancing behind him, Ron already had his wand out and was dealing with two Death Eaters who had come from inside. As he watched, a man who had to be Crabbe, Sr came into the room as well, making eye contact and starting his way. A sharp pain in his arm brought Harry's attention back to the four Death Eaters already closing in on him. 

Without even thinking about it, Harry started throwing spells so fast he was barely aiming. He didn't really need to since they were so close around him. A petrificus totalus had one of them toppling to the ground. His expelliarmus did no good. They seemed to have expected it. Harry slowed two of them down with impedimenta.

The fourth, however, flung an incarcerous at Harry that he was unable to dodge. In moments, he was completely tied up and it was strangling him. Harry couldn't move, could do nothing to prevent their capture. Crabbe Sr was almost to him, grinning. In the background, Harry saw that Ron was being held at wandpoint by another Death Eater. There was fear in his eyes.

BOOM! The wall of the kitchen burst open. Through the dust and debris, Harry couldn't quite believe what he saw. Minerva McGonagall swooped toward him on a broom, her hair coming out of its precise bun and flying madly around her head. ""Stupefy!"" she yelled at the Death Eater holding him still. She plucked Harry from the man's hands, swinging her broom around to knock Crabbe Sr in the face as they raced back out of the building.

With a quickly muttered counterspell, his professor had Harry out of the thick ropes that bound him. To their left, he saw Fin and Ron on another broom. They flew at top speed, even though no one seemed to be chasing them. 

As they flew, McGonagall spoke to her two ex-pupils, ""Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, I see your plans still rely on sheer, dumb luck."" 

The boys looked at each other, abashed. 

She looked at them over her glasses, smiled and winked, ""I must say, I continue to be impressed.""

Harry and Ron grinned at one another. They were glad to be out of there. It had been too close of a call. Who knew Crabbe would have that many actual Death Eaters on hand?

After a few minutes, Ron shouted over, ""We should land and apparate. We don't want to be followed."" The others agreed.

McGonagall brought Harry in to a perfectly smooth landing. Seeing his somewhat stunned expression, she answered his unasked question, ""I might not have been the youngest seeker in a century like yourself, but in my prime I played a mean game of Quidditch, you know."" 

Harry stood with his mouth agape until Ron shoved him, reminding him they needed to apparate back to Hogwarts. Just before they left, Professor McGonagall looked at each of them and said a very sincere ""Thank you for getting me out of that place, boys.""

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

It was dark again outside and Hermione was still in bed. She couldn't believe how empty and drained she felt. She couldn't have worked magic this day if her life had depended on it. The truly frightening part was that she didn't understand what happened. 

Much like the phantom pain she had felt one night, Hermione had suddenly experienced a feeling she knew was not her own. Feeling the person's pain and utter hopelessness, when their magic pulled on the strange vibrant thread between them, she pushed her magic to help. She was confused why there was no question within herself. Whoever they were, she must trust and respect them very much to have allowed this bond. Not that she had thought that all out. In the moment, she just responded to the need.

Hermione considered how dangerous that could have been, could still be, if their situation were even the tiniest bit different. She was so fatigued that she couldn't move from the bed today. What if she had been out somewhere and couldn't apparate back? What if they had been or still were attacked? She would be captured in an instant. 

""Mistress Hermione, yous must be eating to feel better.""

Hermione gave her a cross look and huffed, ""If you would tell me what you know about this thread inside me, I might know what to do to heal faster.""

""Rest heals a body fasters and betters."" Mimsy put a cold cloth on Hermione's forehead and began spoon feeding her delicious soup. It was over the top - Hermione was certain she could have lifted a spoon at least - but she didn't have the energy to fight her caretaker.

Hermione felt like she had never tasted anything so filling and wholesome, until suddenly her stomach lurched and she was spewing it everywhere. 

""Oh, dear,"" Mimsy said as she cleaned up the mess with a simple snap. ""Just somes tea to calm yous tummy."" She was back shortly with a cup of the mint tea she always gave her, with a little extra flavor mixed in this time.

""Mmmmm,"" Hermione appreciated the taste, ""What else did you put in it?"" She would have suspected a sleeping potion or the like except she knew their taste.

""Justs some red raspberry leaf, Mistress Hermione. Its be helping yous body.""

As much as she still felt like Mimsy and the unexpected escape was too good to be true, she found herself trusting the elf's help. Where she kept coming up with all this tea in the middle of nowhere was a mystery, but Hermione was grateful for it. It did seem to settle her stomach a bit and her body felt less achy. 

After she had finished the cup of tea, Hermione lay back. She barely had energy even to think, but she couldn't just drift off without going over things. Any day she couldn't send her patronus was a possible wasted day. What if someone was there briefly and she missed them because she hadn't any magic this day? Yet, the unanswered messages were wearing on her. Were they all in worse shape than the papers thought? That was disturbing to consider. 

Hermione wanted to cry all of a sudden. Oh great, she thought. She was regaining enough strength to have emotional jumps as she had been prone to lately. Post traumatic stress disorder was something Hermione knew about, and she thought surely there was some name for mid-traumatic stress issues as well. She wanted some better explanation for how she had been feeling lately, but it was obvious the stress was just getting to her. 

She wished that one of the books she picked up had been about bonds. She was so curious - and exasperated - about this thread that connected to someone else. That someone was in a lot of danger very frequently, which made her suspect they were a prisoner of Voldemort or one of the Death Eaters. Under other circumstances, Hermione thought she could probably follow the magic to that person, but she couldn't risk that with things as they were. 

Part of her wondered if the risk would be worth it if she knew who it was. What if Harry were the person at the other end? She certainly would have willingly bonded herself to him magically if it would somehow help. But she couldn't see a way that it would have. The same went for Ron. Also, perhaps it was silly, but she felt like she would recognize either of them somehow, even through a bond that so far just sent pain and, she suspected, made her feel lonelier and more hollow.

As she drifted off, she noticed Mimsy nearby, humming, smiling, and knitting something small. She was too tired to really wonder what it was.

 

OooOooOooOoo TRIGGER WARNING Rape/non-con/general awfulness ooOooOooOooO

 

Charlie was almost delirious, a state that terrified him in present circumstances. He couldn't afford to be senseless around Bellatrix. But his body was wracked with fever. He was freezing one moment and burning hot the next. Pain radiated from his neck where the collar rubbed his wound. He was almost glad his hands were bound to the bed so that he couldn't try to touch it, scratch the burning itching. He needed to relieve the pain, but he knew rationally that touching it would only make the infection worse and without a wand, there was nothing he could do to help it. 

He had thought the bleeding and horror of her cutting him would be the worst part. He could still see the gleam in her eyes as she reminded him that if he didn't hold still, she might slice something vital. Charlie almost wished he had jerked himself instead of continuing to fight every instinct he had to keep from moving. He had given in and screamed until his throat gave out. He hadn't seen it, but he knew it said ""Blood Traitor."" He didn't mind being marked as such. He just didn't want to die from it.

That thought set him laughing until it became whimpers and tears. He didn't want to die from being a ""Blood Traitor."" Ha. When she killed him, because it was obvious that she would eventually, it would be because he is a blood traitor. He might as well already be dead. He wished he were. He needed the pain to stop. As he laughed, he thought he heard muffled voices, but knew they had to be in his head. He heard Bellatrix worrying over him and begging a healer to fix him. That certainly wasn't real. A low, rolling voice made the most soothing sounds over him and he felt his consciousness slide away, taking the pain with it.

 

When he woke, Charlie had no idea how much time had passed. It could have been hours, could have been days. His arms were still tied, but the collar was off and his body felt like it was pleasantly floating. To his surprise, he heard Bellatrix and that same low, rolling voice talking.

""Just tell me how to keep him well,"" Bellatrix whined.

""He can't wear that collar anymore or the wound will stay infected,"" the low voice, who seemed to be an actual healer, said.

There was fear in Bellatrix's voice when she said, ""But it can't be uncovered! The Dark Lord said I couldn't mark him."" She sounded like a little child who had done something naughty and been caught.

No one spoke for a moment. Charlie tried to move his head to look across the room, but found that moving his neck forward caused the excruciating pain to shoot through him. He gasped and let out a low groan as his head fell back onto the pillows.

""My pet!"" Bellatrix cried, and came racing to him. Her hands were quickly all over him, petting and being disturbingly tender. Charlie did his best not to shudder. ""My poor pet, I didn't mean to hurt you. We were just playing, right? Things just got a little out of hand."" She was gripping his chin, forcing him to look into her eyes. She looked so sincere Charlie wanted to spit in her face. Of course she didn't mean to hurt him by sticking a knife in his neck. Instead of rolling his eyes or scoffing at her, he kept eye contact and tried to nod, wincing as it hurt his neck again.

The healer sedately walked to the bedside. The young man looked to be barely of age, if he was at all. He was dark, with hair and eyes that matched. He had an air about him that made Charlie think he was an aristocrat. He also was definitely not English, familywise. At a guess, he was probably Italian. He wasn't really what Charlie had expected as a healer, but he was grateful for what the man had done for him already.'

""Let me check the patient, please, Madam Lestrange,"" the healer said quietly, carefully moving her wandering hands. Charlie wondered if the healer needed her out of the way or if he understood how thankful Charlie was for that small mercy. 

Bellatrix settled to the side and held his hand. Charlie almost thought he was still in his head making this up. Could she finally be coming around to him? She had been crueler than usual the last three days. She hadn't liked her beloved master saying she couldn't blemish him in front of everyone. He had known at the time that she would find other painful things to do to him instead, but even he hadn't anticipated the level of malice she had attacked with. Her sudden worry for him and acting like she cared - calling in the healer - was disconcerting. 

""I'm Healer Zabini,"" he said. ""Your fever is gone and this salve should help the wound heal and keep you more comfortable while it does. Because the blade is cursed, it will take a long time, and of course there will be a scar.""

As he talked, Zabini's slim fingers delicately skimmed the rough cut letters on Charlie's neck with the salve he had mentioned. Charlie was having a hard time not moaning, the cold, numbing effect felt so good. The deep voice, too, did something to his insides. Comfort felt like something he hadn't had in longer than he could remember. He had his eyes squeezed shut and knew he couldn't open them. He was afraid of the way he would look at this person who was momentarily rescuing him from the pain. With Bellatrix right next to him, he didn't dare react.

When he finished applying the salve, Healer Zabini began wrapping a bandage around his neck, softly covering the letters. He was interrupted by Bellatrix.

""He can't be seen wearing a bandage."" She was worried again.

""He won't be,"" Zabini replied. He muttered something and Charlie felt the bandage tingle on his skin. ""Everyone else will just see a collar. It even has a hook for a leash.""

""I'll need to charm it with some....""

""No."" The healer's voice was firm. ""It can't be charmed with anything or he might not heal properly - that or it might turn back into bandaging instead of the collar. Then people would know.""

There was silence for a moment. Charlie decided he could look now. Bellatrix and Healer Zabini were both leaning over him, though they were looking at each other. Bellatrix looked upset. The young man looked like he was up to something. He spoke again. ""You told me earlier that he's such a good pet, so obedient.""

She nodded and looked down at Charlie, smiling radiantly as she began petting his hair. She didn't notice that he was breathing harder as he forced himself to not move. Zabini's eyes were trying to tell him something. He knew whatever it was wouldn't be something he wanted to do. He had been fighting so hard to get Bellatrix to think him tamed. Even if whatever the healer was planning played into that, it would be something else horrible he would have to do. Not that he would necessarily remember this either.

Charlie could only remember some of the things, of course. It was hard to hold on to a plan with all the obliviating. He didn't actually know how long it had been since his last obliviation, but he thought it had been a few days at least. She left him with some memories now, which muddled the track of time even more. He got to keep the most painful and the most embarrassing. He had a brief memory of his brothers leaving him there. He remembered hours of her using him and beating him. He remembered all the ways the other Death Eaters stared at him and brushed their hands along his body when she forced him to the endless dinners and meetings. 

Bellatrix had made an error, though. When she left the memory of the night the Dark Lord refused to let her cut him, she didn't stop it soon enough. He knew Tonks was here somewhere. He had been convinced that he was unlikely to be the only one, but knowing was different. It both upset and invigorated him. He wasn't alone. And when he escaped, he would get her out, too. It gave him something else to fight for. Thinking about it allowed him to keep fighting in this moment, no matter how exhausted and overwhelmed he felt.

Zabini's voice rolled calmly over him. ""He's such a good boy. He will do what you want without any compulsions on the collar. Won't you, good boy?"" He sounded like he was talking to an actual dog. It sickened Charlie, but he choked out a yes. It took everything within him to keep the anger out of his eyes. He could tell Zabini was trying to help him, and not being compelled to obey was huge, but he couldn't help but resent being spoken to like he wasn't even human. As for Bellatrix, it would just take time, he told himself. This was progress. Bellatrix looked thrilled by his answer, and that's what he wanted, needed her to be.  

The healer began gathering his things to go. Bellatrix stared happily down at Charlie, stroking his muscled arms where they were still tied above his head. He held steady and tried not to focus too hard on how much he did not want to be touched.  ""Healer Zabini,"" she said in an almost sing-song voice, ""I appreciate you so much. I'm sure my pet does, too. I think you deserve a reward.""

Charlie tensed. Whatever she had in mind was likely either going to hurt or humiliate him. He should have known he couldn't have even one night to recover.

The other man looked over at them, his eyes meeting Charlie's for just a second before saying, ""I'm just doing my job, Madam Lestrange. I will be back tomorrow to check on him."" 

He had already started for the servants' door he came in through when Bellatrix grabbed his shoulder. ""No, healer boy. I insist."" Zabini stopped, back ramrod straight, still facing toward the door. Bellatrix went on, ""I've caught you looking at him before. You may fuck him as your reward. He'll be happy to have you - won't you, love?"" 

Charlie couldn't force himself to respond, but was saved by Zabini speaking. ""Thank you, Madam, but I have other patients to see.""

""Come now, I'm sure they can wait a little while. You can even have him with no preparation if you like."" Her tone made it clear this was supposed to be extra enticement. This time she did notice Charlie's breathing picking up, a deep panic making it hard for him to keep calm. 

She was ignoring the healer, so she didn't see him shudder as he turned to face them. He was biting his lip, a look of concentration on his face. Charlie fervently hoped the man was coming up with some way around this. He didn't see any indication that Zabini wanted him that way. There was no eagerness in his reluctant strides back toward the bed. 

Bellatrix was focused back on Charlie, one hand going to his neck to block his airflow even more. She cooed at him, ""You want to show me what a very good boy you are, don't you?""

Charlie reminded himself that he needed to be patient while her trust in him built, and that meant playing the part. He allowed a whimper to slip out and tried to nod. Between the bandaging and her hand on his neck, he could not easily move. 

Healer Zabini sounded calm when he said, ""Madam, you're going to hurt his neck and I will have to fix it again. Do not undo my work."" He looked her straight in the eye, momentarily away from Charlie as he added, ""While I appreciate your offer, I would rather not bugger him. That's not what interests me from a man.""

""Oh?"" she questioned, her hand sliding down onto Charlie's chest and toying with a nipple instead. ""Would you like to come in his mouth instead?"" 

Charlie focused on getting his breath evened out. He could do that. Actually, he was surprised to find his cock twitching at the thought. She had long since spelled him to be aroused at all times, even through the fever she hadn't allowed him any relief in that respect. But actually reacting to the situation around him...there was something that pulled him toward the young healer. Charlie was ashamed that his first thought was how he might be able to use a connection like that. This man actually seemed human amongst the monsters. Charlie hated that he had to look at that as something to use.

""No,"" Zabini said. Charlie thought he might be blushing. ""You are right, of course, that I've looked at him. As our Dark Lord said, he's a fine specimen. What I want, if I'm allowed, is to suck his cock and swallow his seed.""

Charlie couldn't help his body's response. He was even harder now than the spell held him. She had another spell that could keep him from reaching climax and, the worst, one that held him right at the edge then ruined the orgasm on her command. She had held him on the brink for over an hour one day. She hadn't let him have release since then either. His balls were constantly tight and painful. Sometimes she would play with them, and had even slapped them a few times. He couldn't stand to think about the amount of pain that had caused. The idea that he might finally be granted release was enough to make him thrust his hips forward without thinking.

""It seems my good boy likes that idea,"" Bellatrix mused. Her hand reached down and stroked him once, leaving Charlie trembling with need. She only let him come now when he attacked and forced her. She had caught him crying after the first time, and hadn't stopped pushing him for it since then, taunting him for becoming a monster. She would tease and torture him, but give little opportunities here and there to let him use her, until he couldn't stop himself. She seemed to delight in the role reversal. It's what had given him the idea in the first place that he might be able to convince her to care for and trust him. The last few days, she had made sure there were no possibilities for any of that.

Bellatrix smiled down at him. ""I will allow it, this once. If you're sure that's what you want, healer boy.""

Zabini swallowed and nodded. He removed his Healer's robes. He wasn't meeting Charlie's eyes anymore, but he could see anyway. The boy's pupils were blown wide with arousal. Maybe he really was going to get off on this, or maybe it was just the least evil thing he could get away with. Maybe both. Charlie found he didn't care much. If it gave him release and kept Bellatrix from being the one to touch him like that, he was as willing as he was able to be.

Not daring to talk to him directly, Zabini told Bellatrix, ""He will need to be perfectly still so that his neck stays straight for the bandage."" 

""Oh, I can make sure he doesn't move,"" she said. Charlie couldn't believe it when she began to finally untie his arms. He wasn't sure how that would help him not move, but having that freedom felt intoxicating. She was giving him too much at once, he realized. He would have to be very careful not to let her realize it, too. As weak as it made him feel, he truly did not want this taken away.

The bed moved suddenly beside him. Bellatrix was scooting on. One of her legs went around him until her body was wrapping his, with Charlie in between her legs, his broad back against her chest as she leaned against the headboard. ""He'll have his head right here on my shoulder,"" she said, petting down his chest as she spoke, ""And I'll get a perfect view of the show."" She sounded delighted. Charlie wasn't sure if this was good or bad, but it didn't really matter. Whatever it was, he had no choice but to go through it.

""Come onto the bed with us, Healer Zabini. What's your name again, child?""

""Blaise,"" he answered, his voice a little less smooth than normal. He started to crawl onto the bed.

""Pet, be a good boy and spread your legs further. Let him crawl in between. Your arms are not allowed to move, but you may grip my legs with your hands if you need to."" Looking up, she commanded Blaise to take off his shirt, at least. ""I know you don't need to remove any clothing to suck his cock, but it will be more fun for me to look at.""

Blaise hesitated, but shed his shirt after a moment. He was incredibly slim. He didn't have muscles to speak of, but he was beautiful. Bellatrix hummed, ""The dark and the light. The two of you look stunning next to each other. You'll look even better once he's in your mouth. Don't worry - I won't let him come too soon."" 

Charlie groaned at that last declaration. She twisted his nipple hard enough to make him yelp. ""Making sounds you don't have permission for might make me change my mind about letting him drink your release. Is that what you want, my pet?""

She was holding his head so that he couldn't move it, so he had to make the words come out even though they tasted like ash. ""No, Mistress. Please, please let him have his reward.""

""You see, Blaise. He wants you to suck him. Begging for it. He really is such a good boy, isn't he?""

""Yes, Ma'am,"" Blaise said, licking his lips without realizing it. Charlie hated to admit it, but he was breathing harder and feeling like he might go mad from the anticipation. When Blaise tentatively touched him, he sucked in air so hard Bellatrix whispered in his ear that he was allowed to moan. Thank Merlin, because he couldn't have held it in once that hand was working slowly up and down, the deep, dark eyes staring into his. 

Charlie wasn't listening as Bellatrix praised him. He gasped and let his fingers flex into her thighs when Blaise dropped his head and licked around the mushroom tip of Charlie's cock. He couldn't stop the noises pouring from his throat as the other man wrapped his sweet, wet mouth around him and slid up and down. 

The tingling of one of Bellatrix's spells filled him with the fear that she wouldn't let him finish, but Charlie was too distracted to even think about doing anything about it. She said she would just hold me off for a while, he murmured in his head. She would let him come this time. Merlin, she had to. He was going to explode. Only he couldn't, no matter how good it felt. 

And Blaise was doing everything in his power to make it feel good. Beyond the soft wet velvet of his mouth, the man's tongue was sinfully swirling up, down, and around while he sucked. Charlie wanted to scream every time it flicked along the slit at the top, gathering his precum, but he didn't have permission for that. He was having a hard time being still, but Bellatrix was holding him around the chest and whispering reminders that he couldn't move his neck. Her voice was sweet, loving. Her breath was close enough that it tickled his ear when she spoke. Despite all the times he had been forced to be with her, this was by far the most intimate. He fucking hated it.      

Then she started kissing down his back at the same moment Blaise changed his rhythm and speed. Charlie had to fight a moan from escaping, knowing she would assume it was about what she had been doing. He must not have hidden it well enough, since he heard a hiss of laughter from Bellatrix and her hands lightly roamed his torso. It should have disgusted him but he just didn't have it in him to fight how good this felt. Even if Bellatrix was part of it.

When he thought he had gotten used to all the different stimulation, Blaise caught his eyes, hollowed out his cheeks, and took his fat cock all the way to the back of his throat and swallowed. Charlie cried out. He couldn't stop himself. The scream it tore from his throat was ongoing as his body fought for the release it needed. His magic was crying out for it, too. He felt like they were in the middle of a storm. He could almost feel the rush of that storm reaching and pulling. 

There was a shimmer of magic from Bellatrix dropping the spell, and Charlie's world imploded. He saw stars before everything went black for a few long seconds. The waves of pleasure when he came to were so overwhelming that he felt tears on his cheeks. He was moaning and crying out as Blaise continued to milk him with his mouth, his slim fingers pumping the base. Charlie felt his whole body shaking. His head was only still because Bellatrix was holding it in place, one hand trailing along his neck.

""My good boy. Don't hurt yourself, pet."" She kissed along the back of his neck and shoulders. Charlie wanted to throw his head back, wanted to hide somewhere he could bask in the afterglow without her fucking touching him. This was all far too much. 

Blaise finally released Charlie's cock from his mouth, his tongue drawing along the shrunken length of it as he moved away, making Charlie shudder and close his eyes. He heard the deep rumble of Blaise's voice but couldn't make sense of the words. 

Then there was someone hovering above him, lips on his, a tongue teasing his mouth open. He could taste himself on this new mouth, but it wasn't a turn-off. The sensation of stubble against his cheek was new as well, but somehow heightened the feelings. It wouldn't take much of this for his body to be ready again. One of Blaise's hands came up, tentatively, and held onto Charlie's hand where Bellatrix couldn't see.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, Charlie was aware that he shouldn't be enjoying this. Bellatrix was still behind him, though he cared so little about what she was doing that he was barely aware of her. He should be appalled and want to fight them both off of him. But here in this moment, all he wanted was to keep this. He desperately needed this feeling of being held and cherished. Later he could plan how it might work in his favor. For now, he allowed himself to bask in it, losing himself in Blaise's touch.

Summary of the triggering part:

After Voldy commanded her not to blemish her new pet, Bellatrix cut 'Blood Traitor' into Charlie's neck where it wouldn't show under his collar. It got infected and he is now feverish. Bellatrix has Blaise come and see to him, allowing him to talk her into replacing the big collar with a bandage spelled to looked like a collar. She agrees to not put any additional spells on it that would control him. She decides they will reward Blaise for his help by offering him Charlie. She won't take no for an answer. Choosing the least horrible thing he can get away with, Blaise says he wants to suck Charlie off. She allows it, even using her rather twisted sexual spells to hold him off for a while until Blaise (and Charlie) has had time to enjoy himself. Throughout the entire scene, we see Charlie internally wanting to fight back, his growing hatred for her, and his plan to gain her trust. Externally, he is playing along. 

 

On a side note, when I started writing this, I really didn't think Charlie was going to be a major secondary character. Surprise! He has a mind of his own with this story. You will, however, be seeing a lot more of Hermione soon and Draco as well.

I'm sorry this is posting rather later in the day than usual. I'm finding as I get further in that I have a lot more editing to do and I'm not prepared quite as early. 

I haven't mentioned it since the beginning, but this is the first fanfic I've ever written. Now that I'm this far into it and working with an alpha, @omnenomnom, there are a lot of things I would probably do differently. Don't worry, I have no intention of abandoning this! 

I am curious, however, about some things for the sake of improving my writing. If you have the time, I would appreciate a comment that addresses any strong feelings you have on the topics. I may or may not change much in the way I write this particular story, depending on feedback, but knowing what readers like can help my writing overall and I have LOTS of plunnies beyond this one.

How do you feel about the perspective changing between lots of different characters?

Do any of the characters specifically bore you? Who and why?

This story is summarized as a Dramione, and it is, but it also has the larger overarching plot of trying to win the war, which encompasses a lot more people than just the two of them. Does it bother you that Draco and Hermione are separated for so long even if they make up for it later? Should it have been presented as more of a general war fic somehow? (I have no idea how I would have summarized it otherwise, but just the idea.)

Do you enjoy/want to see the romantic interactions between other characters or is it uninteresting if it's not Draco and Hermione? (This one especially I can guarantee I won't take out some characters, but others I am interested if readers would want more interactions between. More smut or less smut, folks?)

Yes, I just gave you homework. Channel your inner Hermione.

 

As always, much love to both my aforementioned alpha and my beta, @highlyintelligentblonde

And I still don't own Harry Potter.

Sunday, May 17th, 1998; morning

Remus growled quietly as he looked over all of the information Ginny Weasley's mission had contained. Between the things George stole from Malfoy Manor and this packet, there were quite a few things the Order could do to disrupt Riddle's plans. He just wished there was something in the information that let him know Dora was ok. What was happening to her while they pursued other raids and missions?

As much as he hated it, he understood. Getting back into Malfoy Manor after one successful break in was going to be nearly impossible. He knew Ron was working on it, but now there would be even more distractions. There had been considerably more Death Eaters guarding the Crabbe home than they had expected. Riddle must not be happy about the number of prisoners they had been losing.

Or Minerva had been used as bait. It bothered him the way the Death Eaters had ignored Fin and McGonagall but had gone after Harry and Ron. Something about it felt off to the werewolf, even though Ron and Kingsley seemed to find it reasonable. The full moon was approaching, so he had been known to get testy and paranoid around this timeframe. 

Either way, they had the Headmistress back now. She was resting in the Hospital Wing. They hadn't harmed her much but Madam Pomfrey wanted to keep an eye on her for a couple of days, at least. Mrs. Crabbe had too much fun ordering her around to want to hurt her new maid. It hadn't even been hard work, just a bit demeaning. He was glad they had her with the Order again. Hopefully she would have the key to this warding business and they could finish rebuilding the castle before someone got past it now being unplottable. There had been talk of putting the Fidelius on it, but for such a large space, it would take more than one wizard working together. He wasn't sure that was likely to happen.

For now, Remus needed to find Kingsley immediately and suggest a raid on a base they hadn't known about before. They were supposed to be holding quite a few muggleborns there. There would be a number of Death Eaters, but they would be unlikely to expect attack in such a remote location.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

They had traveled to a remote woodland to the West. It was dense enough to be almost dark despite the sunny day. They had flown in - Ron, Harry, Angelina, Michael, Finian, George, Cho, the Patil twins, and three Aurors - Robards, Smith, and their ward specialist Coleton. Ron believed a dozen was a good number even if it turned out to be more than necessary. 

The encampment, when they came to it, didn't look like an encampment at all. It was in a clearing by itself. It looked like a ramshackle shed. Yet walking around the ward perimeter actually took the better part of an hour. It was unnerving how large whatever the wards were hiding must be. Their informant hadn't been certain how many Death Eaters would be there, only that it existed and there were a number of captives there. 

""Do you think they have guards watching us?"" Ron asked Robards.

""It would be the intelligent thing to do. Even if it just appears as a shack in the middle of a clearing, they should at least have people on watch to attack us,"" he answered gruffly. They were hiding outside the clearing and all were dressed to blend in. 

""Unless they were hoping we would come. I wish I knew whose information we're working from,"" Ron whispered. He was frustrated with how little planning could happen before the heat of the moment on this raid. Their goal was to find prisoners and break free as many as possible. 

""General Weasley, sir,"" snarked a familiar voice. Ron rolled his eyes at his brother and indicated he should continue. ""The troops are wondering about the plans, sir."" He threw in a sharp salute to punctuate his sentence. As much as it annoyed Ron, this was also the most like himself he had seen George since the battle. Practically the only time he left his room was to go on raids.

""The plans, Underling George, aren't ready until we see what's in there. Please tell the troops to stand by."" Ron quipped.

""Ah. By the seat of your pants we fly then, General."" George saluted and walked back to the rest of the crowd. There was a wicked light in his eyes that told Ron he was out for blood once they made it in. Harry and Kingsley, as de facto leaders of the Order, had made it clear that lethal force was only to be used in life or death circumstances. George and the Aurors found that most situations could be perceived as life or death.

Very suddenly, with Coleton still in the clearing working the wards, the actual encampment appeared out of nowhere, the wards lifting completely. They didn't have much time to observe all the tents behind as a surge of Death Eaters raced at them. Coleton was down with blood gushing from every orifice in seconds.

Ron barked out orders, ""Michael, Harry, Angelina to the left. Padma, Parvati, Robards to the right. Smith and I take the middle. Fin and Cho, try to get past and find the prisoners. Give them cover."" 

Everyone but Fin and Cho surged forward to meet the oncoming spells. Ron noticed that the majority of the robes were standard issue. Only one seemed to be the individualized robes and mask of an inner circle member. Ron nodded at Smith and they coordinated their movements to work toward the Death Eater. 

Spells were flying everywhere. Ron started the battle hurling impedimentas over and over to give them all time. Once slowed, he could either stun or incarcerous before they got too close. Still, he found himself dodging more often than he was comfortable with. It seemed like an endless number of fighters coming at him. He could see that Smith was breaking a sweat, a feat rarely accomplished.

Padma and Parvati fought back to back against a circle of the robed men. Padma specialized in stunners while Parvati was working them over with jinxes - jelly legs, unstoppable dances, tickling charms, anything to distract them for Padma to stun them when they didn't expect it. They had a circle of bodies piling around them.

Suddenly, a Death Eater with long black hair gave a scream and Avada at Padma. He was cut off with a gurgle when his neck was hit with Robards' Sectumsempra. He hit the next guard with an avada of his own and began slinging deadly curses right and left.

Cho had disappeared. Ron hoped that meant she made it past the fight and was finding the muggleborns who were supposed to be there. Fin was fighting some of the Death Eaters still pouring out of the tents further in. Perhaps he was drawing them off so Cho could do her work.

Michael was shielding for all he was worth. He wasn't the best bloke in an all out battle and Ron realized he shouldn't have brought him when he didn't know what might happen. Still, every now and then the young man managed to hit someone with a petrificus totalus, his specialty.

George was chasing the Death Eaters trying to avoid him and go for one of the others. He was ruthless and Ron had a feeling his spells weren't just stunning. He had never seen his brother so vicious. There wasn't time to dwell on it.

Angelina had jumped back on her broom to dive bomb with spells and sometimes just her body slamming into as many Death Eaters as she could. She distracted a fair number of them as well, as she made what seemed an excellent target - only she was unmatched at dodging. 

Harry was struggling. He had a pile of wands next to him from all the times he had cast expelliarmus so far, but they kept coming. More and more, it seemed like they were specifically after him. 

Ron wanted to yell at him when he saw the blue light of an expulso shooting toward the ground next to Harry, but it was already too late. One moment Harry was standing there deflecting a stunning spell and the next he was on the ground, glasses askew, with three Death Eaters running toward him. Ron was relieved to see he had somehow managed to keep hold of his wand in the blast. He himself was too busy with two new Death Eaters attacking him. 

By the time Ron had taken them down, he was distraught to see that Harry was about to be taken out by a stunner. A savior swooped down in the form of Angelina. She slammed into the Death Eater and tossed Harry his broom. ""They're targeting you, Harry!"" she cried. ""Get out of here!""

Harry's eyes darted around until they made contact with his. Ron wanted to shout at his reckless friend to be careful, but he was just going to have to trust him. He nodded his agreement with Angelina and watched as Harry slipped onto his broom and set off. Angelina covered for him, taking out as many of the enemy as she could so they couldn't follow the Chosen One.

Ron continued to fight against the tide of Death Eaters. The situation felt a little desperate as there was no end in sight. No matter how many they got rid of, it seemed like there were still more coming. At least they weren't hard to take out. This had to be some sort of training camp.

In the distance, Ron finally saw a jet of pink lights go up over the camp. Cho's signal that she had completed her mission. With Harry flying out ahead of them, a collection of Death Eaters pulling out brooms to follow, Ron called a retreat. 

""To Harry! Keep him safe!"" Ron cried, grabbing his own broomstick and heading out.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooO

Harry moved branches out of his way before they could hit him in the face. To avoid being an easier target, he had taken off at a low enough level to move through the forest. It also allowed him to hear his pursuers. Because, somehow, two people had made it past Angelina. 

A green light flew past his shoulder and he turned to shoot a stupefy behind him. It went wide of his target, but Harry put on a burst of speed and tried to get away instead of trying again. They weren't as good of flyers as he was, but they seemed determined. More and more spells were flying his way. He was already halfway back to Hogwarts. He had to lose them.

Seeing a particularly dense tree up ahead, he ducked behind it and hovered, taking careful aim. Within a moment, one of his pursuers fell from their broom. He hated that this might kill them, but it was only his intent to stop them. The second, he hit with an arresto momentum. There was no sign of anyone else.

He began to race along again, moving above the treeline as he worried about the rest of the group and wondered if anyone had found the prisoners. He considered going back, but it seemed like he only made things worse. The others had their battles, but it seemed like far more of them were after him personally. Of course Voldemort was still out to kill him, but he was surprised that such low level Death Eaters were authorized to avada him. One thing the Order had always been able to count on was that Lord Voldemort wanted to do Harry in personally. He wondered what he could do about it as he crossed the wards onto the ground of Hogwarts.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

A cold room.....pain like ice blades everywhere.....

This wasn't her. But where did she end and they begin?

Looking down at her hand, their hand.....skin like frost. Cold, crisp, icy white. Can this hold life within? I feel a heartbeat. Two heartbeats - mine and theirs, but too slow.

A low, rolling voice nearby. Familiar.....their heart whispers family.....

""So much blood lost,"" the voice says.

Something at their lips. Liquid poured between....tastes like metal....feels like warmth, spreading out, bringing them back.

Irritation bubbling up.....despair.....

""You were supposed to let me die,"" their voice is one she knows but can not place. It's out of focus, like the room spinning around them.

Her heart - singular - stutters at the thought. Her hope wavers between them but they need it more. 

Eyes full of ice see her. She feels them separating, flinging her out. Did they not feel her before? Did they not know that two were one?

 

Hermione sat up in bed, gasping. She idly wondered if draining her magic could also bring on hallucinations. That dream had been so real, the feelings so intense. It seemed like something else entirely. 

A few minutes passed before she could get her breathing under control and her heart calmed. She wasn't feeling pain. This was her mind just filling in blanks of what might be happening at the other end of the bond. An emptiness sliced through her. She had given them her hope. What was left for her now?

She shook her head to brush away those thoughts. Of course she still had hope for herself. Her situation was nothing like the one in her dream. She could only hope that whoever she was bonded to was also not in a situation like that. Her stomach did an uncomfortable flip at the thought. 

Hermione considered getting out of bed. The slant of the shadows on the side of the tent told her it was sometime in the afternoon. Her mind felt sluggish after the sharp images, though, and the exhaustion that thrummed through her where her magic should have been was quickly pulling her back under.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Harry trudged up toward the castle, trying not to look up at the half-ruined building he loved as his first real home. He was frustrated. He should have been able to do more during the raid. He knew he had neutralized quite a few of them, but the camp had so many more people than they had expected. Though he wasn't sure about the comment Angelina had made, he had to admit it seemed likely they were targeting him. So now even more people would have to die for him.

McGonagall's voice suddenly rang out across the grounds. ""All available hands to the hospital wing, please!""
Harry broke into a run.

 

There was chaos everywhere. McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey were with the worst cases, but many more were in need of care. Harry was useless for that, but he found a job with Fleur. She was well enough to do some smaller healing spells, but she needed someone like him to lift people and move them around so she could conserve her magic for the important parts. 

""Is this everyone who was out?"" he heard Remus ask. 

""No,"" replied an exhausted Cho. ""I found these prisoners and was able to apparate them out before the guards remembered to check on them rather than just fight the Order. There were others...it was..."" She slid onto her knees sobbing. 

Harry thought about going to her. Someone should. The thought of her wet tears from fifth year came back, though, and he shook his head. Someone being there for her didn't mean he should be. Relief swept over him when he saw Neville sink down beside her and pull Cho into his arms. 

When things finally slowed down, Harry counted nine muggleborns and two muggles. Cho had been given a Calming Drought before reporting that there were probably 20 more at least, mostly muggles, but they were so far gone already that she wasn't sure they would survive apparition. Cho felt terrible about leaving the rest of the prisoners and her team behind. But it had been most important to get her survivors to the castle.

Finian walked into the hospital wing with Parvati in his arms and the chaos began all over again. When it was all sorted, they had lost the ward specialist, Coleton but beyond him, five of the team members had some kind of minor injury, though only Parvati would be in the hospital overnight. 

 

Ron came to him as they were exiting the hospital wing. ""You okay?"" Ron asked.

""Yeah, no one got me,"" Harry told him. ""Just frustrated I was more of a distraction than a help,"" he said.

His friend nodded, then pulled the two of them into an empty classroom. ""Harry, we've got to talk."" Ron pulled a handful of wands out of his robes. He took a deep breath. ""We're at war. You keep us well stocked with extra wands, mate, but.... Harry, in a situation like we were just in, disarming them isn't enough.""

Harry blinked at Ron. ""We're the good side, Ron. We can't just go around killing people.""

""If we don't take prisoners and we don't kill people, Harry, we're going to lose this war. We need to be doing both. In chess, you don't just move your opponent's pieces out of the way and then put them back on the board.""

""You know chess references go right over my head,"" Harry responded uncomfortably, sidestepping the real issue. He couldn't believe what Ron was saying. He had seen the kinds of spells the Aurors and George were throwing, but he had decided it was prudent to turn a blind eye in the moment. This was a topic he wanted discussed at the next meeting, but he was shocked that Ron was on the other side of it.

There was something hard in Ron's blue eyes when he said, ""Just think about it, Harry. How long do we want this war to go on? Who do we want to win?""

Harry didn't say anything. He didn't know what to say. After a minute, Ron squeezed his shoulder and headed out the door.

I don't think we have any trigger warnings this time. 

Thank you for the feedback, for those who gave it last time. Feel free to read, review, and tell me what you think of the story overall and the direction its headed if you wish.

My alpha, omnenomnom, is still awesome!

JK Rowling still unfortunately owns all this.

Monday, May 19, 1998; morning

Sunshine was streaming in the tent and Hermione was determined to get up and out into it. Three days and she still felt fatigued. At least her magic was working properly again. Almost two days without it had frayed her nerves to the point of a near breakdown. She was thankful that Mimsy and her calming teas and soup had been there through it all. She had managed to keep some soup down a few times now. She just never knew when she would suddenly feel queasy again. 

With great effort, she made her way up from the bed and stumbled into the loo. At least if they were stuck camping, they were in a tent with plumbing. The wizarding world was really amazing sometimes, she had to reflect. It was good to remember, too, lest she decide to run away into the muggle world and forget all of this. As if she would be allowed to, Hermione scoffed at herself.

She had to have help from Mimsy, but she did make it out into the sun. She doubted the elf would have helped her if she hadn't approved of the idea that the sunshine might make her feel well again. No matter how much better she got, Hermione couldn't shake the dull ache in her heart and abdomen when she thought about the person on the other end of that thread. She almost wished that she had another of those vivid dreams. Silly as it sounded, it had made the ache more bearable, as though she had actually been with the person. She thought the intense feelings of loneliness she was having must be an effect of being far from whomever she was bonded with.

After she had rested a little longer and Mimsy had brought her more tea, a book, and a blanket, Hermione pulled out her wand. Well, the wand she had. It was beautiful, with ivy carved all up and down it. The wood seemed to be some kind of willow, very flexible. She didn't know who it had originally belonged to, but she knew it wasn't really hers. She was very fortunate that it responded so sweetly to her. 

Raising the wand, she cast the spells she had performed daily for almost three weeks now. Well, daily until the last few days. She tried not to dwell on it, not to let the panic that she might have missed someone hearing her message settle into her heart.

 

************************************

 

Bill was making a big breakfast for his wife, even though he knew she wouldn't eat most of it - bacon, sausage, eggs, toast. Fleur watched as he cooked. ""Oh Beel, you make ze best food.""

""Only the best for my perfect lady,"" he replied. 

She laughed, the sound like bells, sending a happy shiver down Bill's spine. He very much enjoyed his wife's Veela heritage.

As he delivered her breakfast to their kitchen table at Shell Cottage, he leaned down and captured her lips. He was so glad they had decided to leave Hogwarts and come home for the rest of her recovery. Perhaps she was feeling well enough today that they could begin practicing for the baby they both wanted. He knew neither of them were ready to try for another pregnancy yet, but there was no harm in practicing.

He poured his love into the kiss, taking it from a brief brush of lips into a flash of passion. Fleur's laughter returned, but this time throaty and a little bit dark. They were approaching the full moon within the week. That near-growl she could do was enough to roll Bill right over the edge. He moved his hands down, stroking along her beautiful body.

Suddenly, there was a brilliant flash in the middle of the room. Bill's hand was off of his wife, on his wand, with his body thrown between her and the light before he had any idea what it was. A patronus was flying around the living room - a dragon, he realized. Suddenly it looked straight at him and said in a voice they had all feared they wouldn't hear again, ""This is Hermione. I don't know why my patronus changed, but it's me. If anyone is there to hear this, please send someone to meet me at the Nags Head Inn in Lydney at 6pm. I won't be immediately obvious, but I will be watching for you. I hope this finds someone."" The little dragon looked momentarily sad, but then whipped around Bill and Fleur happily and disappeared.

Fleur had gasped when Hermione began speaking. ""Beel, we must go to her!""

He looked at his wife in shock. ""Absolutely not!""

""What? You weel not help her!?""

""Of course I will, but you're staying here.""

His wife gave him the look. Under other circumstances he would have given in to it. He hated having her angry with him. There was no way, however, that he was going to let his wife leave this house anytime soon. 

""I'll get someone to come with me,"" he assured her, while mentally adding, ""and someone else to be with you."" 

He bid her to eat her breakfast while he contacted the Order and began making arrangements. Before long, it had been decided that George and Angelina would come. Fleur had always liked Angelina and would enjoy her company while he and George went to see if this was really Hermione. He had asked that Ron and Harry be left in the dark for now. No one needed them doing anything stupid.

Bill wasn't entirely certain what stupidity the two of them might get up to in this situation, but he agreed it was better not to know. With those things out of the way, there was nothing left to do but wait. He wished the time had been sooner, but he supposed she might be doing something during the day. A little research showed him that the Nags Head Inn was a muggle establishment. If she had been hiding in the muggle world, she would have needed some way to afford her things. She had been missing since the battle....over 2 weeks. Anything could have happened to her in that time.

Bill had never been close to the girl. She was too young for him to know well, plus she was his baby brother's best friend...and perhaps something more. Ron could be ridiculously jealous sometimes and had never appreciated any of his brothers having much to do with her. Still, she was a close friend of the entire family and he had felt extra protective of her since the incident after Malfoy Manor only a few weeks ago. She was also the only thing that kept Harry and Ron going for the last year, the brain behind the things they had done. Bill had a lot of respect for her from all of the things he had heard about her. 

More important at the moment, when they had called George to the planning room and informed him of his next ""mission"" it was the first time he had seen George happy since their mum had woken. Anyone who could bring that response out in his brother was someone Bill had to hold in high esteem. Waiting until the evening was going to be exhausting. Perhaps Fleur would be willing to provide a distraction.

 

***********************************************

 

A major change had occurred between the last meeting and this one. Kingsley was no longer in charge. Presiding at the front of the hall was Headmistress McGonagall. Everyone smiled as they filtered in and saw her. Not everyone had gotten a chance to talk to her since her rescue, so a number of people meandered up to the front desk before the meeting could commence. 

Even with the late start, Harry and Ginny came skidding in late, their robes slightly askew. McGonagall looked over her glasses at them and said, ""How nice of you to join us."" Ron looked over at him and rolled his eyes, but grinned conspiratorially. There had been so many instances of the two of them running into classes late like that. Harry just hoped Ron wouldn't think about what had made the two of them specifically late together.

Harry was in good spirits even though he knew this was going to be a tough meeting. Protecting the castle was important but hard with so few of them. The Order was recruiting more people, but they were having a difficult time deciding what to do with them until they were certain each person could be trusted. There were the wards to discuss. And he was very hopeful about his plans to discuss the kinds of spells they were using.

""Today we must discuss battle plans in case the castle comes under attack,"" Headmistress McGonagall began. ""We are working on how to put the Fidelius on the whole property, but something of this size has never been attempted before. In the meantime, we will be breaking into smaller groups to discuss everyone's part in protecting the castle as it is.""

The Order members, young and old, looked grim. The idea of Hogwarts coming under attack again with it only half rebuilt was daunting. Everyone began receiving their assignments, some guarding the outer perimeters, a guard contingent watching from the astronomy tower at all times, some building additional safeguards and traps at the edges of the inhabited parts of the castle. They began to separate into groups according to their assignments. Everyone except him. There had been no group that included Harry.

""Excuse me,"" he said. People stopped talking and looked at him. He wished they wouldn't. ""Headmistress McGonagall, where should I be? I think you've forgotten me.""

She stared at him for a moment, a pitying look in her eyes. ""I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, but you won't have an assignment here at the castle.""

""What!? You can't make me stay in the common room or something while fighting is going on!""

""That's not...""

""I know I can be a bit reckless, but you need every fighter you can get!"" He stood, his anger getting the best of him.

""Be that as it may, Mr. Potter, we...""

""I can't believe you would take away my duties and make a decision like this to force me....""

""Mr. Potter, "" McGonagall snapped as she stood to her full and formidable height, ""You have not been relieved of any duties. You have been removed to fulfill your duties at an alternative location. We will brief you on the changes after the main meeting.""

She sat down in the stunned silence. Harry had no idea what to say. Ginny reached for him, threading her hand through his and tugging him down beside her. Harry sat in a daze, unable to even think, much less argue. This was not at all how he had expected the meeting to go. He forgot everything he had been looking forward to discussing.

When the meeting drew to a close, Ginny softly said, ""They just want to talk to you right now. And the Slytherins. I don't understand, but... I love you, Harry. You haven't done anything wrong.""

He got up and gloomily made his way toward the Headmistress. As he did, he saw the flash of red hair and remembered that his very best friend was in charge of the battle tactics. Ron would get him out of this mess.

 

""Ah, Mr. Potter,"" McGonagall looked at him a little severely. ""Are you ready to listen?""

""Yes, ma'am,"" he replied sullenly. He would hear the plan first, then argue against it. That's what Hermione would tell him to do.

""You are leaving tonight for a safe house. You will be taking Theodore and Gregory with you. Some new recruits will join you in a few days as well. Dean Thomas is coming, too. He has already been informed. The two of you will be the senior Order members at this location.""

Harry's jaw was hanging open. ""You're just...sending me away with people you can't trust? Is Dean my guardian?"" Harry was furious.

""He is there to help you remain in control of the house. We may send someone with more experience after a while as well, but for now we can't spare anyone else.""

""Someone with more experience? That's an interesting way to say you want a real grown-up heading up the place."" 

""Perhaps you could prove to us that it is unnecessary.""

""It's unnecessary to send me away when you need me here helping!""

Ron spoke up then, ""Harry. I know you don't like this, mate, but you're the most important of all of us. We're not ready for a final battle, so you can't face Voldy yet. You have to be somewhere safe. That you can look out for those we can't trust yet is killing two stones with a bird - isn't that what Hermione always says?""

Harry glared at him. ""I can't believe you would do this to me!""

""I'm in charge of tactics here now, Harry. You don't send your King to take out pawns. If this were all a big chess game, you know that you and Voldy are the opposing Kings.""

""This isn't a bloody chess game!"" Harry cried.

""No, Mr. Potter,"" Headmistress McGonagall spoke softly, ""it's the fate of the wizarding world.""

He deflated. He was still angry, but he couldn't say they weren't right. Harry didn't have to like it, but he knew he had been targeted lately. If there was going to be a battle that wasn't the battle, he needed to be out of it. He turned on his heel and stormed out of the room. Theo and Goyle watched him go then nodded politely to the Headmistress and left to gather their things.

 

**********************************

 

Hermione was sitting with a good view of the door. She liked the way the booth obscured her, even if any wizards who came in wouldn't immediately recognize her anyway. Part of her wanted to give up on this. She had thought longingly of sending a patronus to Harry and Ron directly and being done with it. But what would she do - truly - if it went to them at a crucial and distracting moment? She still hadn't gathered enough information to make sure that wasn't a possibility. This just felt so hopeless. Every single time the door opened, her breath caught, but it was never anyone she knew.

The door opened again, but a group was going out as two figures came in wearing ball caps. She couldn't get a good look at them for a moment. When she finally saw them, her heart stopped for a moment. A long red ponytail went down the back of one tall figure, an earring hanging from one ear. His slightly shorter counterpart showed just a tiny bit of red hair coming out from under his cap. They were facing away from her, ordering from the bar, but she knew them at once - Bill and one of the twins! 

Hermione couldn't breathe for a moment. She had been so sure no one would show that her plan of how to talk to them had grown fuzzy in her mind. Taking a deep breath, she slid from the booth, taking a moment to let her exhausted body adjust to moving. Then she headed to the bar. 

She walked up next to them, smiling at the bartender and asking him for another. As she waited, she looked the brothers up and down. With a flirty smile she asked George if the two were brothers. Bill responded absently that they were, though his eyes were far away as he looked around the bar. 

""How many brothers do you have?"" she asked. 

Bill was still paying no attention to her, but George was suddenly staring at her, something in his eyes expressing a depth of emotion - grief, and perhaps recognition. ""There are five of us now - we hope,"" he said.

Hermione's mouth dropped open, suddenly remembering the upstairs corridor and the wall falling. ""Oh George, no!"" she cried, flinging herself into his arms. Bill spun around, surprised to see his brother with his arms full of the woman who had been standing next to them at the bar. She touched Bill's hand and whispered a quick notice-me-not and then dropped her glamour. 

 

""Come with me,"" she said, and drug them both out the door. 

Bill looked like he was going to say something, but Hermione grabbed each of their hands in one of her own and spun them into apparition before he could speak. Seconds later, they were in the forest with her tent in front of them. 

""Who's they, Mistress Hermione?"" Mimsy demanded, hands on her hips. 

George looked stunned by the words the little creature said. ""Mistress Hermione?"" he repeated, and then he began guffawing, laughing so hard he couldn't stand.Hermione shot him an irritated look, but couldn't hold it, laughing herself after a moment. 

Mimsy rolled her eyes, tapped her foot, and finally demanded, ""Well? Who they be?""

Hermione cleared her throat. ""I'm sorry, Mimsy. These are my friends. Some of the friends I've been looking for.""

The little elf suddenly beamed at Bill and George. ""Yous must be coming in. Mimsy cook. Yous must eat.""

""Oh, we don't need..."" Bill started, but the look the house elf gave him made it clear that hadn't been a suggestion. 

Hermione shook her head then. ""No, Mimsy. That's an order. You haven't cooked yet, have you?""

""No, Mistress Hermione,"" Mimsy replied, her tone petulant.

""Perfect. We need to pack up and go with them to an Order safehouse. I am sure there is a kitchen wherever we're going."" she wheedled. Mimsy's eyes lit up and she smiled at Hermione. 

""Of course, Mistress. Yous take care of yous books and I's be packing the rest.""

As Hermione packed her books quickly into her beaded bag, everything else that made the tent homey flew past their heads into a pillowcase.          

George ducked under a lamp and asked, ""So you own a house elf?""

Hermione looked up at him with a worried look. ""I'm....I'm not really sure if I own her or not. But she's coming with me.""

George smiled, ""I can't wait to hear this story!""

""There's so much to tell,"" Hermione said. ""And so much I want to know! How's Ron? And Harry! I thought he was dead until I saw them both in the Undesireables list in the paper.""

""They're both doing fine, Hermione. Harry was out for a few days after the battle, but he's okay now,"" Bill said.

""I've been so worried about them! About everyone. Can you take us home now? I can't wait to see Fleur! Is the baby growing well? I know it's a big secret, or was, but she told me when we were at Shell Cottage after the Manor.""

Bill's face fell. George quickly turned Hermione away from his brother to give Bill a private moment. ""There's a lot for you to catch up on, love. Not all of it is good.""

No trigger warnings this time. But perhaps I should warn you that there is quite a bit of talk about Fred's death and how George is coping.

I realize (only because I went back and read that bit to see) that in canon, Hermione is actually there when Fred dies. So, I am using my author's magic wand to go back and say it is canon right up until mid-Battle....except when Fred is dying, at which point Hermione is somewhere else. Oh, and the Room of Requirement is still around. Which doesn't matter right now, but probably will in the somewhat distant future. Otherwise totally canon. Unless something becomes inconvenient later.... 

My alpha, @omnenomnom, is the greatest. The chapter didn't get beta-ed this week because I was too late finishing my edits. All mistakes are mine. 

I still don't own Harry Potter.

Monday, May 18, 1998; evening

As soon as George quietly explained what happened to Fleur, Hermione whirled around him. ""Bill, I'm sor....""

George caught her shoulder and pulled back as Bill stalked away in the other direction. Tears streaked down Hermione's cheeks as she looked between the brothers in bewilderment. ""He can't handle sympathy right now. Some things are just too close."" He knew his own voice was shaking when he said the last.

Hermione looked at him for a moment then threw her arms around him for a hug, the second in one day. Somehow, despite shaking off every other person who tried to comfort him these days, George found himself allowing her embrace. Maybe it was because she clearly needed comfort, too, and would need so much more before she finished hearing everything. Maybe it was just that Hermione couldn't know, for sure, that it was Fred he had lost. Someone would tell her soon, but for now, it was just one of the brothers. It could have been someone less important, Percy or Ron or Charlie. He sucked in a tight breath. Charlie might very well be dead by now, too.

George shuddered at that thought. He knew it was wrong to wish it had been one of the others, knew he would have been upset to lose any of them. But not like this. Not like half of his soul had been ripped out. How was he supposed to go on like this? 

Everyone was worried about him. He knew. He just didn't have the energy to stay in the world of the living and make other people happy at the same time. Even the people he loved. He knew part of him didn't even want to see them or anyone else happy. How could there be happiness without Fred? The two of them had dedicated their lives to making people laugh, making them feel joy and happiness. Now it was like that was all sucked away, like maybe all those good intentions were in the part of their soul that had been Fred. 

George was an empty, angry shell without his twin. He only felt alive when he could hunt and kill Death Eaters, go after them as ruthlessly as they had come after the people he and Fred loved. Well, and now. He was far too alive, drowning in it, at this moment.

A small, indignant throat clearing made George jump, then filled him with relief as he moved away from Hermione. The house elf was eyeing them closely. ""Mistress Hermione, I can'ts be putting away the tent when yous still in it.""

Hermione sniffled as she pulled away from him. ""I'm sorry, Mimsy. We'll get out."" Looking around, she added in a worried tone, ""Where's Bill?""

""Him is pretending to check yous wards, Mistress. You calls him back. I be packing the tent.""

George helped her out of the tent and started toward his brother. He was surprised when Hermione's hand grabbed his and pulled back. ""Is there anything else I need to know?"" she asked, ""Before we go back to Bill or before we see Fleur at the cottage?""

His mouth opened. This would be the moment to share so they didn't have to talk about it more later, but if he put it off, he could hope someone else would tell her when he wasn't around. Their Gryffindor courage had gone with Fred, too, apparently. He answered gruffly, ""Nothing else they can't handle telling. Her ordeal included most of the prisoners. Oh. And a death eater from your class. Nott, Jr. He's supposedly on our side now, but Fleur gets upset sometimes when people talk about him.""

""Only sometimes?"" Hermione questioned. 

""It's a bit of a mystery how much he helped them or didn't. They were obliviated before they got to his manor. So he seemed as kind to them as he could get away with in front of a bunch of death eater guards, but then she wonders if he could have stepped in and saved them before she lost the baby. How she reacts just depends on her mood and the day."" He could see Hermione processing and noting all of that in her mind. 

""I was obliviated, too. It's terrifying to know that things happened and you don't remember them. And for something so awful to be a part of that...."" she started, but then they were at Bill's side. 

""We're ready to get out of here."" George said with a nudge to his brother. 

Bill nodded, though his eyes were still far away. He didn't ask what they had talked about. George knew he trusted him to have handled it. Their family had gotten adept at saving each other from the stories they each couldn't tell. 

""Let's get us all home,"" Bill said, offering his arm to Hermione while George held Mimsy's. 

 

They were met at the floo by Angelina's wand and a plethora of identifying questions, as agreed upon. Once they had proven themselves, the girls were all squealing and embracing. George noticed that Hermione was careful what she said to Fleur. 

""I know there's a lot I need to tell you all, but please - is the Order still operating? You said Harry and Ron are alive. Did...did most people make it out?"" Hermione seemed timid about the things she needed to know. 

Bill raised his eyebrows. None of them had realized how little information she had. Stopping her tumble of words, he told her, ""Most did. And most of the ones who didn't have been....recovered one way or another. Professor Flitwick is still unaccounted for."" Bill swallowed hard before continuing. ""Charlie and Tonks are prisoners in Malfoy Manor.""

Hermione gasped at that. ""I hope they find their way to whoever helped me.""

George cleared his throat. He had been looking for the right time to ask. ""How did you make it out?""

Hermione slowly began her tale, what she remembered of it. George couldn't imagine being mentally thrown from the battle into the situation she had been in, mid-escape. As they listened, the house-elf-that-might-be-Hermione's had taken over the kitchen from Angelina and, by the smells, was creating a delectable feast. He couldn't help his Weasley stomach; George loved house elves.

""I have so many questions about what has happened to me, but the biggest mystery is the bond."" Hermione stated uncertainly.

""What bond?"" George asked.

""It's like a magical thread,"" she explained. Gesturing to the west, she continued, ""It goes off that way somewhere. I think I could follow it if I wanted to. My magic...wants to follow it.""

Bill was leaning forward all of a sudden, ""What does it look like?"" he asked.

Hermione was contemplative for a moment. ""Sometimes, when something is happening, I can feel it shimmering golden. But the rest...""

""You feel it shimmering gold? Shouldn't that be something you see?"" Angelina questioned.

""Yes,"" Hermione agreed hesitantly, ""I know it doesn't really make sense. But I can't see it with my eyes, only feel it there. And sometimes it shimmers. The rest of the time it's just a plain white thread that I don't even notice unless I'm thinking about it.""

""You said it shimmers when something happens,"" Bill led the conversation. George wondered what his brother was thinking. He knew that look. Bill was trying to pin down the sort of magic they were talking about.

""Yes. Sometimes it's just a little bit. I feel an empty, aching feeling and it shimmers a bit. There have been a couple of times that there was pain that wasn't mine. Just this week, I've had a rough few days because whoever is on the other end needed my magic.""

""What do you mean, they needed your magic?"" George demanded. Something about this worried him.

At the same time, Bill asked, ""Are you sure it's a person on the other end of the thread?""

""Yes,"" Hermione replied. It was obvious she was quite certain. ""The emotions I get sometimes. They belong to someone who is in a dangerous and desperate situation. I don't know who it is, but I have to assume it's someone who had been captured.""

""You're sure it's a prisoner?"" Bill asked. 

She gave him a frustrated look. ""No, I can't be sure. But it makes the most sense. I suppose it might be one of the people who helped me escape. I imagine the Death Eaters would be more than willing to exact their revenge on them.""

Bill looked concerned. ""Do you think you could track the connection to the other person if you wanted?"" She nodded and his face paled. ""I need to consult,"" he rushed to say, then turned quickly and headed for the floo. 

""Oi! What are you doing!?"" George started to follow him. 

""No!"" his brother's tone was panicked. ""George, you have to stay here and protect them. I'll be back soon."" With that, he said, ""Headmaster's office, Hogwarts,"" and was gone.

Hermione looked worried. She had, of course, followed Bill's line of questioning. ""Oh Merlin! I didn't consider.... Even now I may be putting everyone in danger.""

""How?"" Angelina asked.

""If I can follow the thread to that person, they can follow their end to me. I shouldn't be here!""

""Don't you dare disappear again!"" George found himself shouting. Hermione looked completely taken aback. He took a shaky breath. ""You haven't seen Harry and Ron yet. They didn't know we were coming to get you tonight. They don't even know for sure that you're alive. Bill will be back soon and he'll have a plan.""

George felt awful. When he mentioned Harry and Ron, her composure had slipped and tears begun spilling down her cheeks. He was such a git, he berated himself. ""Why don't we tell you everything that has been happening with us while we wait? You won't believe how Harry and Mum....""

""Oh, your Mum! I forgot to even ask about her. I saw her go down. Bellatrix..."" Hermione began to cry harder. 

""Bellatrix didn't kill her, just knocked her out. Ginny and Snape brought her and Harry out of their comas...with pie.""

""Snape's alive? Wait...pie?""

""Kitchen witchery,"" George explained. Like Mum does, only more precise thanks to the Dungeon Bat.""

""And now it time for Mimsy kitchen witchies. Eats yous food,"" Mimsy interrupted. She was levitating in a number of trays, each one filled to the brim with delicious-smelling food.

""Yes, ma'am!"" George exclaimed, tucking into the plate he had filled. He leaned over to Hermione and loud-whispered, ""I like her."" She laughed through the last of her tears and began nibbling at her food as the others filled her in between bites.

Mimsy was happily refilling trays as soon as anyone took something off of one. Hermione was taking a small bite each time the little elf glared at her, while sipping her minty tea between exclamations at the things her friends had to say. 

It was Fleur who finally mentioned Fred. George had been dreading it, bracing for it. But he still felt her words like a punch to the gut. ""It eez so good to 'ave you here, George. You 'aven't come out of your room seence Fred died...."" 

Hermione gasped. ""Fred?"" Her voice held disbelief. When she turned to him, her eyes were filled with a distress that echoed in George's heart, in his lungs as he tried to pull in air. Hermione continued, ""How? Fred... I should have asked who.... I just...wanted to forget, I suppose. That someone was gone. But, George....how could...""

""How could I have let Freddie die and stayed here without him?"" George knew his tone was bitter, angry. He knew what he was saying would just upset her more. But it was better than pity. It was better than them all seeing that he was just half a man, less than half, with the loss of his twin.

""I would never say something like that, George!"" Hermione cried. ""I would never think that. Fred would be glad you're still here, no matter what happened. I was intending to beg your forgiveness for not asking.""

""I wasn't there! A bloody wall fell on him and I wasn't there to help him. I would have shielded him. I would have...""

""You just would have died, too."" Angelina tried to reason.

""No. I could have died instead. Fred should still be here!"" George shouted at her. 

""It eez time to calm down, George. There eez no need to be so angry. It won't bring him back."" Fleur was looking at him with the pity he couldn't stand.

""Well I'm angry whether there's a need to be or not."" he growled. George felt the anger spiking. He felt his magic pulsing, looking for something to explode. A release of all this pain and sadness and anger was what he fucking needed. He leapt to his feet and started toward the front door.

Angelina stepped into his path. ""Did you forget that you're supposed to be helping me protect Fleur and Hermione?""

George took a step back. His body was shaking with pent up energy. He wished a troop of Death Eaters would appear so he could attack, fighting blindly until every last one of them were dead. Maybe if he protected enough other people, killed enough Death Eaters, he would someday feel like he had done enough. He knew it was bullshit. Nothing would ever be enough to make up for him losing Fred, for not being there when it mattered. But what else could he do?

""You 'ave to put all this behind you,"" Fleur told him. ""We are all 'urting, but it eez not helping to act like this.""

The windows exploded along the walls nearest them. All three girls screamed, but George just laughed. It didn't sound like his laugh. It sounded like splintered glass. He couldn't seem to stop it either. He felt like he was going to explode next, just shatter into a million pieces.

He jerked as a small hand touched his arm. ""George?"" Hermione's voice was tentative. The crazed laughter finally stopped and he felt himself vibrating instead. ""It's okay to feel the things you're feeling. You have every right to be angry. They took half of you away. It's okay to make them want to pay for it.""

George stared at her. No one had said that before. The room was quiet, Fleur and Angelina just watching them. The energy coursing through his veins suddenly began to spill out his eyes, tears streaming.

Hermione gently touched his wet cheek. ""George.... is it too much or may I hug you?"" She asked softly. 

At first, he shook his head, pulling away. He wrapped his arms around himself for a second, thinking about hidden moments his twin would hug him and let him cry when things seemed bad. Merlin, he hadn't known what bad was back then. They always had each other to take care of and lean on. How dare Fred leave him here alone? How fucking dare he!? With that thought, that horrible thought, George sank to his knees and reached for Hermione. ""Please?"" 

Before he could blink, she was on the ground next to him, arms snaked around him, allowing his head to rest on her shoulder, hidden in the wild tumble of her hair. He didn't know how long they sat there. George couldn't hear anything except his own sobs and the soothing tone of Hermione's voice. He had no idea what she was saying, but she had already given him what he needed most - permission to feel it all.

George eventually realized all his excess energy was gone. He felt empty, but in a better way than he had been. He sat there listening to the steady beat of her heart, his head having slipped down by her chest. She was petting his hair and still whispering soothing words. She had the patience of a saint, he decided. Slowly, he began to notice the world around them again. Fleur had repaired the windows. Angelina was talking with the French witch, who looked more than a little upset.

The floo suddenly whooshed to life. George sprung up, wand drawn, and jumped in front of the fireplace as the rest of them drew their wands. Bill stepped out with Headmistress McGonagall coming through behind him. Fleur ran to her husband and began speaking rapid French. George decided he would ignore the potential confrontation for now. There were more important things to discuss than his breakdown.

""Professor!"" Hermione cried, and practically ran Bill over to get to the older woman. 

""Call me Minerva, child. You're no longer just a student,"" McGonagall said as she fiercely hugged Hermione back. ""What you've been through...I wish I knew exactly what happened to us from the battle on, but what bits I heard and the story Bill told me - your courage is as Gryffindor as I could ever hope. You've made me proud.""

Hermione glowed under her praise. ""I'm so glad you were able to escape, too!""

After a quick glare George's way, Bill cleared his throat. ""I think there were a number of things we must discuss tonight.""

""Yes, well,"" McGonagall said, ""There is the matter of this magical bond. I need to do some tests on you, Hermione.""

She began waving her wand and bits of sparkling magic appeared around Hermione. Suddenly, everyone could see the tiny cord of magic stretching out to the west. ""It looks just how it feels,"" Hermione said with a tone of wonder. George found himself almost smiling at the fact she could still see magic as something amazing even after all the bad parts of it she had encountered. It reminded him there was hope.

After a few minutes, she nodded abruptly and canceled the spells. ""May I see your hand?"" she asked. Hermione of course held both hands out for her, palm up. McGonagall ran her finger over a scar there. ""This was done with a cursed blade,"" she muttered.

""It feels just like the cuts on my arm,"" Hermione said, a sadness in her voice, with steel beneath.

McGonagall nodded thoughtfully then said, ""I believe we're in luck. Bill and I were discussing the situation with Dumbledore's portrait. Though the tool used for whatever binding ritual was done to you must have been dark, it doesn't seem like the bond itself is. We are sure, too, that even if the person is capable of following you, they will not be able to follow you to any place concealed by the Fidelius Charm.""

""So Shell Cottage is safe?"" Hermione asked for confirmation. She looked relieved.

""Yes, my dear,"" McGonagall said fondly. ""I don't know that this will be the place we leave you, but it's safer than Hogwarts for you until we can figure out how to Fidelius the place.""

""Put all of Hogwarts under a Fidelius Charm!? That would take a tremendous amount of power!"" She looked intrigued. George had seen that look before. As much as she had gotten on to Fred and himself, there had also been a look of admiration over some of their most inspired inventions. 

""It's not the only defense we'll have, but it's one Professor Snape and I are working on.""

""You and SNAPE?"" George heard himself burst out. ""How can we trust him with something so important!?""

Headmistress McGonagall looked down her nose at him. ""Kindly remember that he has been my friend and colleague for almost a decade. I have watched his memories and am certain they were not tampered with. I trust him impeccably."" She sniffed. ""To satisfy the fools who do not, he won't be involved when the spell is actually cast. His help in research, however, is priceless.""

Turning back to her lost student, she continued, ""There is actually a separate project I need you to begin working on, Hermione."" The girl nodded with enthusiasm. George shook his head at how much she loved an assignment. McGonagall continued, ""We have been working to rebuild Hogwarts but stopped when we realized that ancient wards were worked into the building itself."" 

Bill stepped in, ""If we don't find a way to rework them, the structure of the very building as well as its value as a fortress will be compromised. Hogwarts should be the safest place in Britain. Right now it is vulnerable to practically any attack.""

""We've lost the Auror's best ward specialist, but Bill is better than he was anyway. He will be helping you,"" McGonagall beamed at Bill as though she were a proud parent. ""I have high hopes that the two of you together will find our solution.""

Hermione happily accepted the challenge. 

""Now, there is also the matter of this...house elf,"" McGonagall's voice faltered questioningly as she eyed Hermione's suddenly red cheeks. ""You felt it safe to bring her here?""

""She...I...Honestly, Minerva, I don't know what to think about her. Has Bill told you what he knows about her?""

""Yes. I find it highly suspicious that someone would give you a house elf in such a manner.""

""Dids the Madam be talking about Mimsy?"" a small voice piped up indignantly. She had walked right up on the Headmistress' other side without anyone noticing. 

McGonagall looked taken aback by the little creature's daring. ""I am, in fact,"" she finally managed.

""Mistress Hermione is Mimsy's family. Mimsy nots ever betray hers family."" Her fists were balled up on her hips and her face looked pinched. George wanted to laugh, watching these two fierce personalities face off.

""Why would your Master give you away to her?""

The elf pulled down on her ears, opening and closing her mouth like she wanted to say something but couldn't. She finally settled on, ""Hims knew Mistress Hermione is mines family now.""

""How are we to know that he didn't tell you to say that while spying for him? If Hermione is your family, you must understand we want her to be kept safe.""

Mimsy glared and repeated, ""Mistress Hermione is mys family."" With no hesitation, she added, ""If Master woulds ask me to spys, I woulds say hims a bad boy and punish him like whens he was a little boy if hes not be good. Hims know Mimsy mean business."" She shook her finger at all of them and it was impossible not to believe that she meant it. 

No one said anything to that. The headmistress seemed unsure of how to argue further. 

Mimsy rolled her eyes and said, ""Theys be a spell yous wizards can do on Mimsy. To knows my family. The bad man checked all the elfses to know who belongs to whos.""

McGonagall and Bill exchanged looks. Bill stepped forward. ""I am familiar with a similar spell, but not one that would identify a family by name. It shows the connection to the people they are bound to. If some are far away, it will show a connection beaming off toward them.""

""Yous good wizard,"" Mimsy said as she presented herself willingly. Bill quickly said the incantation and waved his wand quickly around the elf and the rest of the room. She spun with the strength of the magic wrapping around her, then a line of orange light ran directly from her to Hermione. The line was made of two parts, a darker segment and a lighter, intertwined and then wrapped around Hermione, sheathing from her heart to her abdomen, the darker part focused on her heart area and going lighter toward the bottom.

George saw the puzzled look on his brother's face. He wondered what that meant. Bill glanced around the room. There were no other beams of light heading off into the distance. 

""It appears I owe you a sincere apology, Mimsy,"" Headmistress McGonagall addressed the little elf.

Mimsy nodded once and then bowed, ""Yous must keeps our Mistress safe. Mimsy appreciates yous.""

""I believe that's all for tonight, then. I will take my leave. The school often needs my guidance even with so few children,"" McGonagall said. She gave Hermione another hug and then went back through the floo.

 

*******************************

 

Hermione woke early the next morning, indulgently stretching in the comfy bed. Shell Cottage always seemed luxurious to her, no matter how frightening the circumstances that brought her there. She really must visit here when something terrible wasn't happening. Someday. When the war is over, she thought.

There was so much to do to get to that point, though. The first order of business would be to plan her research tactics. Humming happily, she rummaged through her beaded bag for a notebook. Though there was a lovely little writing desk in her guest room, Hermione decided she would go sit in the kitchen with a cup of tea. The sun was still low enough that she might have beaten Mimsy out of bed, so she wouldn't have the mint tea she had become accustomed to, but a warm cup of regular tea would feel nice as well.

Down in the kitchen, she found a mug that fit her hands perfectly. She sat down, sighed, and began her list. It took her only a moment to dive in and get lost in her own world. An hour later, she was so busy scrawling across her notebook that it took her a moment to even realize someone else had entered the kitchen.

Bill was quiet, so perhaps that wasn't such a surprise. When he spoke, she nearly knocked her teacup over. ""How are you feeling, Hermione?"" 

She squealed, probably waking the whole house. Her cheeks immediately tinged pink. ""You scared me, Bill,"" she said, when her heart began to slow. ""Before that I felt fine,"" she laughed.

He smiled, but seemed to have something more to say as he prepared his own tea and began making some eggs and toast. Hermione waited, not wanting to lose herself in her notes again when he clearly intended to talk some more. 

""You said you can only remember things from the time you arrived in Paris? Other than the battle itself, that is.""

""Yes,"" she answered. ""It's frustrating. Anything could have happened. All I know is that Mimsy says it was Blaise Zabini who brought me to the house before obliviating me and apparating away. Why would he do that?""

""Is he someone you knew before the war?"" Bill queried.

""Only vaguely. He is a Slytherin. He didn't harass us like Malfoy always did. He seemed well-liked both among the Slytherins and the Hufflepuffs, I think. I can believe he's a decent human being. But...."" Hermione wasn't sure she wanted to share the one detail she had held back so far. 

""What is it?"" Bill asked, leaning forward.

She blushed. ""When I woke up, I had no clothes. Mimsy had to take me upstairs in the villa to grab robes. It was part of why everything felt like such a terrifying rush to get out.""

Bill's jaw had dropped, his face had turned red, and then his eyes went hard and angry. It was an expression she had seen countless times, though not often on this particular Weasley.

""Do you think Zabini...hurt you before letting you go?""

Hermione didn't answer for a moment. She didn't know what to say. Of course he could have. Or some other Death Eater could have before he got her away. There was no way to know and it made her feel crazy.

""I just don't know, Bill,"" she finally replied. ""I don't want to think he would have - or anyone else - but we're dealing with Death Eaters. There is no way to tell what they would or wouldn't have done.""

""Who might have done what?"" Angelina asked with a yawn.

""Oh just talking about the twins and a joke one of them may have pulled,"" Bill lied smoothly. He blinked hard to shake the anger away from his expression and make his wolfish grin look more real. Angelina had frozen at the first look on his face. 

""Oh no!"" Hermione broke the tension with a sudden realization, ""Last night, I didn't ask Professor McGonagall when I could see Harry and Ron! We still have a bit of our task to do, I think."" Her brows scrunched as she tried to remember whether the snake had been killed. As far as she knew, it had not. So one more horcrux and the creature Voldemort himself. She grimaced to herself, but then shook the darker thoughts away. ""Um...does anyone know if.... Riddle's snake made it through the battle?""

""That nasty giant thing?"" George groaned as he stumbled in. He started to prep some tea, but as he knocked his cup over, Mimsy shooed him away, bringing a full cup to him once he was sitting. Hermione wasn't entirely sure when the little elf had arrived in the kitchen, but she was quickly creating the biggest breakfast Hermione had seen in some time. 

""Her name is Nagini. She is definitely giant and nasty,"" she agreed. 

""As far as I know, she wasn't at the battle at all. She obviously had taken out Snape earlier in the evening,"" George paused at how vigorously Hermione nodded to that, ""but he was the only person she seemed to have attacked. None of the dead had been bitten. And only a potions master who had been prepared for her could have survived.""

Hermione contemplated that. One way to keep his pet safe was definitely to keep her away from the fight. And he had known by the time the battle started that his other horcruxes were compromised. She needed to get to Harry and Ron and find out what they were planning to do about that snake. She added it to one of her lists.

No trigger warnings for this one either! Is that two chapters in a row? What am I even doing with this story these days? 

I really can't think of anything I need to say about this one. If anyone is reading this one as well as Less Than Pure, I *swear* I'm working on an update for that one, too. The holidays have taken more of my writing time than I had anticipated.

As always, I don't own Harry Potter.

Tuesday, May 19, 1998; morning

They had arrived so late the night before that none of them had gotten a good look around the place. It was large - not quite a manor, but Harry decided he would describe it as a mansion. He had no idea how many bedrooms there were, but enough that he, Dean, Theo, and Goyle each had their own rooms and there were still more than they could count available. 

Wandering out from his room, Harry followed his nose down the long hallway to the stairs, headed down to the first floor, and quickly found the kitchen. To his surprise, Theo was standing in his pajama pants cooking breakfast. There was water boiling for tea and, to Harry's delight, a pot of coffee already brewed. 

He barely managed to acknowledge the other boy in his rush to get to the life-giving elixir. Pausing just before he began to chug it down, Harry stared dubiously into the cup he had just poured.

""It's not poisoned,"" Theo responded without even looking back. ""I put that in the pancakes.""

Harry laughed before he could stop himself, then took a tentative sip of the coffee. It tasted perfect and he found himself draining the rest of the cup and pouring another.

""I hope you're hungry, too,"" the curly-haired boy said with a chuckle, ""I learned to cook from house elves and they cook in large quantities.""

Harry gaped at him for a moment. ""You learned to cook from house elves?"" He had assumed the Nott heir was another spoiled pureblood brat. 

Theo's sapphire eyes sparked for a second, and his lips pinched together. Then he sighed and nodded, ""Hard to believe, I know."" He didn't offer any further explanation, just gave Harry a winning grin as he set a plate piled high with food in front of him and took the nearest chair for himself. 

""Should I wait for you to finish eating so I know what the poison does?"" Harry said, smiling so that Theo would know he wasn't serious. 

""Not on the first day,"" Theo scoffed. ""I have to wait until you trust me."" He took a big bite of his food and chewed contemplatively. ""And for the new recruits to arrive so I can pin it on one of them,"" he deadpanned. Harry blinked, wondering if the other boy could be serious. But then Theo was grinning again and Harry found himself smiling a bit, too.

Both boys busied themselves eating. Harry cherished his coffee and looked around. The kitchen was very functional. It wasn't a space meant for entertaining. This table seemed like it was there more to sit and prep food than for eating. He supposed there was a formal dining room somewhere nearby. 

Goyle lumbered in, with Dean coming in behind him. Goyle looked especially pleased to see the huge spread Theo had created. Shocking the two Gryffindors, as they had never heard him speak before, Goyle mumbled, ""You've outdone yourself this time, Nott.""

""Thanks, Greg,"" he replied, grimacing slightly at being referred to by his last name. 

They were all quiet as they finished eating. Harry's thoughts as he poured himself another cup of coffee were dreary. People were going to die because of him and he had been pulled from the fight. The whole castle could go down in flames and he wouldn't even know until it was too late. Something could happen to Ginny. Or Remus, the last of the Marauders. He still hadn't properly mourned Hagrid or Fred or the little Creevey boy. Neville was still in the hospital wing. What if something happened to another of the Weasley's? They still didn't have Charlie back. Or any idea where Hermione was. Who was going to go after them if he was being sidelined?

His ""mission"" was to sit here with two Slytherins and Dean - who was undoubtedly there as much to keep him in line as the other two - and...he didn't even know what. Just exist. He stared glumly into the cup of coffee. Staying busy had been easy in the castle, rebuilding to do, the excitement of real missions to go out on, Ginny to distract him when everything else was calm. He wasn't sure he could hold himself together without all that. He suddenly had an even deeper understanding of how Sirius had felt when he was trapped hiding at Grimmauld Place. Harry was angered to think that, though prettier, he had essentially just been welcomed into a prison himself. McGonagall had been very clear that this was where he was ""needed"" for the foreseeable future, Harry thought bitterly.

Theo stood and began putting away the leftovers that would keep, setting the dishes to clean themselves as he went. He spoke as he worked, ""What's the plan for us here, Lions? I assume you two are in charge."" 

His voice was friendly, with no hint of anger, just a statement of fact. Harry wondered if this was some kind of Slytherin plot or if the other boy was genuinely fine being commanded by Dean and himself. Harry exchanged a glance with Dean. He knew he hadn't been given any instructions, but maybe they had told Dean more?

Dean cleared his throat and tried to speak. Harry realized as he watched the other boy that he might not have been the best choice to keep them all in line. Finally, Dean managed, ""Well, I believe we're supposed to get to know the two of you a bit better. And some new recruits will be joining us soon. Harry and I's job is to keep people here until we are sure they're trustworthy.""

Harry groaned, ""Dean, I don't think we're supposed to tell the people who aren't trusted that we're the ones deciding if they're trustworthy.""

""Why not?"" Dean asked earnestly. All Harry could do was shake his head. Even he wasn't naive enough to think that was a good idea. He was thrown off by Theo's laughter. Goyle was chuckling, too.

""Because you can't trust us not to fake our trustworthiness if we know that's what you're doing,"" Theo explained through tears of laughter. 

""I thought we already knew that was what they were doing and what we were doing,"" Goyle said with his forehead scrunched up.

Theo clapped him on the back. ""Indeed, Greg. But we are also not supposed to let them know that we know that. I can see the Lions are going to rub off on you quickly."" He dodged backward as he said it, knowing Goyle would come after him. The other boy didn't disappoint, though his boisterous ""attack"" was playful. 

Harry watched in something like awe. He had never seen Goyle act playful. He had never dreamed that Slytherins were capable of a good laugh that wasn't based on someone else getting hurt or put down. He had already felt a pull toward Theo. Perhaps getting to know both boys would be an interesting way to pass the time. 

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

Ginny sat sadly at the Gryffindor table. She was pushing her food around the plate listlessly. She really couldn't believe that Harry had been sent away, and with almost no warning. She understood why he had to be safe, of course. She was glad he was. But she wanted to be there with him. Most of her friends had been up and gone before she got up. The whole castle was a hive of activity, but Ginny just didn't feel like throwing herself into the work that needed doing today.

""Are you moping, dear?"" her Mum asked, tone somewhere between sympathetic and exasperated.

Ginny mumbled an answer. Of course her mother knew she was moping. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw her mum roll her eyes at her, smiling at her friend Miss Eliza Turnbuckle. 

""Now listen here, girl,"" the ancient witch said. Miss Eliza was pushing 200. She was well respected since she was such a dear, sweet thing. Well, she was sweet until she was angry. Then she would rise up to her full height, almost 6 ft, and pull out the twisted branch that was her wand. At that point, she was well respected out of terror. 

""I know there are many who think I'm just your typical witch from the woods, living alone with my cats and kitchen garden. But I'll tell you - you don't get as old as I am letting pretty boys into your life."" Miss Eliza was punctuating every word by poking her fork into the air. 

Despite herself, Ginny had to smother a laugh. ""I believe you Miss Eliza. Mine is already taking years off of mine,"" she said. She did not say that she would rather die earlier and keep her pretty boy if she had anything to say about it. But she certainly thought it.

And that thought put her mind back where it should be. She was here to ensure that the war kept moving toward Harry's win against Voldy. She wasn't going to sit around and whine about being lonely. She still had so many people standing by her here. And maybe she should emulate Miss Eliza and get a cat or ten. Ginny giggled to herself. She was suddenly in a much better mood and ready to get back to work.

She was just pushing back from the table when George walked in. Not only did he walk into the Great Hall, but he was half smiling. He was also heading straight for her. Ginny gaped at him. Her brother hadn't been out of his room in almost a month except to go out on raids. He was reckless and ferocious during battles. Otherwise, he might as well have died with Fred for all they saw him. 

He caught her shoulders in his hands and pulled her into a rough hug. ""Ginny, love,"" he whispered in her ear, ""Come with me out to the lake. I have some news."" Over his shoulder as he headed back out, he called, ""Love you, Mum!""

Ginny's eyes widened fractionally at him and then rushed to follow him out. His long legs were striding out of the hall, out through the entrance, and across the grounds almost as fast as they could carry him. Ginny had to run to keep up. Just when she was considering Accioing her broom, he came to an abrupt halt, turned and grabbed her around the waist, swinging her up into the air like he used to when she was little. She squealed much like she used to as well. 

""She's alive!"" he cried out. ""She's alive and well and at Shell Cottage!"" 

His excitement was contagious, but Ginny was a bit confused. ""Who?"" she laughed. 

George looked momentarily gobsmacked before laughing and telling her, ""Hermione! She's okay. She's BACK!""

""Thank Merlin!"" Ginny exclaimed. She couldn't even say how much she had missed that witch. Harry and Ron had been beside themselves without her.

George laughed again before confiding, ""And she's got herself a house elf.""

A surge of anger blew through Ginny and her eyes welled up. She hadn't thought he was up to acting happy over a joke yet. Outraged, she punched her brother in the gut. ""How DARE you?""

""How dare I what?"" George wheezed.

""How dare you joke about something like this! How could you make up something so cruel? I was about to owl Harry and Ron. I should know better than to trust you.""

""No, no! I swear it's not a joke, Gin."" George backed away, looking seriously frightened. He actually knew quite well how dangerous Ginny could be when she wanted to be. ""Please don't tell me you've been practicing your Bat Bogey even more lately,"" he begged.

She gave him an evil glare. ""Of course I have, you git. Just for arseholes who think they can make fun of me for worrying about my missing friends."" Near the end, her words started to dissolve into tears.

George looked more upset than she had expected as he pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to her. ""I'm not making fun of you, Gin. I wouldn't joke about this.""

Ginny didn't believe him, but said, ""So you're telling me your mission yesterday was to...what? Find Hermione?""

""It was to retrieve her. And we did - Bill and I! She's safe.""

Ginny stared at him hard for a moment before nodding. ""We've got to tell Ron!"" she said abruptly, and took off at a run, George following behind.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

As always, Ron was in the Headmistress' office, plotting the next moves of their ragtag ""army."" The latest intelligence warned of an attack on muggle London coming up soon. They didn't know exactly when, just that it was imminent. He couldn't believe it, but he was wishing for a source like Snape, at least someone as reliable as he had been. Still, at least they had someone. Even though their knowledge was often vague, it hadn't proved incorrect thus far. 

Staring hard at all the papers and maps before him, he pulled a quill and parchment nearer, jotting off notes for several people. He would brief a group soon and have them ready to apparate to London at a moment's notice. It would be tricky, but hopefully they could stop too much damage from occurring. He had just sent the last note flying when the Headmistress walked in. 

""Weasley,"" she said with a nod at him.

""McGonagall,"" he said with a nod back. Ron couldn't get over his own amusement that he was no longer required to call her by a title. 

""I have something important to discuss with you if it's not an interruption.""

He gave her a quizzical look. ""If it's important, then it's not an interruption.""

She nodded, but explained, ""It's of a more personal nature at the moment. Not that she isn't an important addition to our arsenal, but...I think you will want to know this before I announce it at dinner this evening.""

Ron was intrigued now. Seeing she had his attention, McGonagall continued, ""Miss Granger has returned to us.""

Ron leapt up so fast that his chair fell back. ""Hermione is here!?!"" He started to rush for the door.

""Slow down, Mr. Weasley,"" she rushed, ""She is not here at the castle, but she is no longer lost to us.""

""What?"" He skidded to a halt. His heart was beating frantically, every fiber of his being focused on Hermione. ""What do you mean?""

""Due to circumstances, she will be unable to come to the castle until we have figured out the Fidelius Charm.""

""Fine. Let's go!"" He started heading to the floo. ""Which house is she at?""

McGonagall caught his arm, pulling him lightly back. ""We will not be going anywhere, Mr. Weasley.""

His face contorted with sudden rage. ""She's my best mate! My...I love her. I need to see her!""

The older woman lifted an eyebrow at him. ""I am aware that your relationship with Miss Granger makes you want to see her, but it would be unwise to allow our primary tactician, the General of our army, off the premises, and quite dangerous for her to come here.""

""What's wrong with her? Why does she have to stay under the Fidelius?"" he demanded.

McGonagall sniffed as she replied, ""It is not something I am at liberty to share as it's rather personal in nature.""

Ron was grinding his teeth. How dare anyone keep him from Hermione? If Harry were here, he would demand to see her and it would just happen. Sometimes Ron despised the way people treated him so differently than Harry. Even as the supposed General of their army, he wasn't accorded the same respect Harry had just from surviving Voldemort as a baby. 	

His mind whirring with plans, Ron decided to go find Kingsley. He knew the man was fond of the complete trio. Perhaps together they could override McGonagall, gather Harry, and get to wherever Hermione was now. 

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

""Ron, "" Kingsley said with a grin as Ron walked in. Remus immediately felt his hackles raise. Kingsley might be oblivious to the redhead's mood, but he was not. Something had the young Weasley in one of his rages.

""Do you know what she's done!?"" Ron stormed.

Kingsley was immediately taken aback. ""What who has done?""

""McGonagall, the old harpy,"" he said, eliciting a gasp from the man. Remus pushed back from the table to simply watch. Ron's temper was legendary. Without Harry and Hermione to keep him in line, he could be very intense and out of control.

Before either of them could process and ask what indeed the headmistress had done, Ron was barging on, ""She told me I can't go get Mione! They've found her. And they won't let me see her!""

Remus felt his jaw drop. Maybe he agreed with Ron for once, though for a different reason. What was McGonagall thinking, holding this information from them? Hermione was back! Thank Merlin. They needed her. But why couldn't Ron see her? Was she not at the castle yet? Surely she would be soon enough. That was probably it. He was just too impatient to wait for her to arrive.

Some of the same questions were tumbling out of Kingsley's mouth and Ron launched into another explanation, pacing back and forth in front of them as he gestured wildly with emphasis. ""She says Hermione can't come to the castle until it's under a Fidelius. So they're keeping her at a safe house somewhere. But she won't tell me why - says it's a personal matter - and she won't let me go to her, some nonsense about the General not leaving the premises.""

""Ahem..."" Kingsley interrupted, ""We've been meaning to have a word with you about that, Ron. You understand why we had to send Harry away.""

""Of course. It was partially my suggestion. This isn't about Harry right now!"" He stomped to emphasize his point.

""No, but Ron, you are just as much a danger out on the field, just as much a target, as Harry himself. You need to see reason; staying in the castle and using your strategic mind is what we need from you."" Kingsley seemed unphased that the boy's face was practically turning purple with rage. 

Remus felt that it was troublesome, but...he had a hard time relating to the boy's problem. Yes, of course he would want to go to Tonks the moment she was found. But if it were somehow unsafe for her for him to see her, he would wait. At least he would know she was safe. That was so much more than he had right now. Watching the boy yell and pace and throw his fit was making Remus' blood pressure rise. He was ready to take the child down a few notches, as he already had once before. Perhaps, especially this close to the full moon, it was just best if the two of them were not near one another. 

Ron was surprised when Remus suddenly stood and started walking toward the door. ""Come on, Remus! You're with me on this, right? What if it were Tonks being kept from you?"" he shouted at the werewolf's back. 

Remus turned slowly, a growl already sounding deep in his throat. ""You know where she is and that she is safe. Be grateful."" With that, he stormed from the room.

 

OooOooOooOooOooOooOooOooO

 

Ron blinked and stared at Kingsley for a moment. Some of the fire had drained out of his argument. So he was able to sidle over to the table where Kingsley sat and say in a reasonable tone, ""Don't you think it would raise morale for everyone to see Harry, Hermione, and I together again. We wouldn't really have to lead anything, just be the figureheads. The three of us belong together.""

Kingsley looked at him with a slightly bewildered expression. He finally said, ""I understand your feelings, General Weasley, but surely you understand how you are needed here. We will work to bring the three of you here together, but I will have to discuss the timeline and circumstances with Professor McGonagall before I can make any promises of when that will be.""

Ron turned without another word and barrelled out of the room.

 

He hadn't gone ten feet outside the door when he ran straight into Ginny and George, both with huge smiles spread on their faces. Ron hadn't seen George smile like there was something actually good in the world since the battle. Ginny ran forward and threw her arms around him. ""Ron, It's so wonderful! Hermione's been found!""

Ron stiffened in his sister's embrace. ""How do you know that already?""

""George told me. His mission yesterday was to retrieve her."" George was nodding behind her. Both clearly expected him to be thrilled.

He felt the rage rushing through him again, zeroing in on his brother. ""They sent you on a mission to get her?"" he asked, almost too calm.

""Indeed they did, wittle brother,"" George said happily, ""I've held her in these very arms. It's really her. She's been through...""

""Why would they send you?"" Ron demanded, holding back the anger he felt when he thought about his brother holding her in any capacity.

George crinkled his brow. ""I was the first redhead Bill saw? McGonagall rolled some dice and it picked me? I don't know. Why does it matter? We found her! Well, she found us, really, but we have her back now.""

""I can't believe she's really okay!"" Ginny gushed. ""I was so afraid she..."" Ginny sniffled and Ron understood exactly what she had feared. The constant worry about Hermione had been eating at him as well. It had been worse for him, of course, considering his feelings for Hermione and all.

""Did she ask about me?"" Ron queried.

""Of course she did! You and Harry were the first people she asked about,"" George assured him.

""Yes, she would need to know about Harry, wouldn't she?"" Ron muttered, the familiar jealousy roaring to life, ""Of course.""

George nodded, ""Poor girl had been going daft trying to figure out if the Order made it out and where we all were and how to contact us safely.""

We. Us. The Order. Ron fumed at the words his brother was saying. Did George really believe that the rest of the people were just as important to her as he was? He inwardly scoffed and prepared to tell his brother just what he thought about that.

Before he could say anything, Ginny looked over at George worriedly. ""Does she know about....those we lost?""

""Yeah, I told her about...him."" George's voice was sad, but not despairing as it had been. ""I...she helped me. Helped me a lot. That girl...she's amazing. I love....""

Ron grabbed the front of his brother's shirt. ""You what? You think you have any right to love her?"" Ron hissed, no longer hiding his fury. 

George blinked at him as Ginny tried to pull him off. ""She's my other little sister. And a damn good friend, you git. What is wrong with you?""

When Ron didn't answer right away or back away from their older brother, Ginny stepped up, wand in hand. ""Unless you want to see how I'm developing the bat bogey hex, you better let him go, Ron."" Reluctantly, with a murderous look still on his face, Ron backed away from George.

""How did you even know already?"" Ginny asked calmly. She had grown up with six brothers, after all. Murderous rages just happened in the Weasley household sometimes.

Ron pressed his lips together grimly. ""McGonagall told me. Said I would want to know before the general announcement. Then the old witch said I can't see her.""

""What? Why?"" Ginny demanded. George, however, was nodding. 

""It wouldn't be safe right now,"" he agreed.

Ron wanted to hurt George again. ""Why would you agree with her!?"" 

George looked uncomfortable suddenly. ""I don't think it's my place to explain, Ron. Some things about her have changed,"" he said slowly. Then his face split into a grin. ""For instance, dear brother, you'll never believe it, but she got herself a house elf!""

""What? There's no way!"" Ron was jarred out of his furious mood by such a ludicrous suggestion. The brothers argued about it all the way down to the Great Hall for dinner and to hear everyone else's reactions to the news.

I don't believe there are any trigger warnings this week either.

Thursday, May 21, 1998; afternoon

Draco was propped up in an infirmary bed at the end of the room. He could stay awake for an hour or two at a time now, a huge improvement from the first few times he had woken since the warding debacle, when he could barely manage a few minutes before he was out again. Blaise told him it was wonderful progress considering. Draco had been furious when he woke there the first time. They were supposed to stop saving him. What the fuck did he have to live for? 

His mother wasn't allowed near him, and even if she were, Draco wasn't sure she would speak to him. The one time he had seen her between the night he killed his father and the day of her wedding, she had told him he was no longer her son and she wanted nothing to do with him. He had thought he would find some way to keep the wedding from happening, some way to make her understand how he thought what he did was the only way for things to get better for them. He should have realized it would only get worse, but he truly hadn't at the time. 

His father. Lucius was the only person Draco had ever killed, despite being stuck in this house of horrors for over 3 years now. Even when he hadn't been home himself, once the Dark Lord began living there, the pressure had been constant. Draco nearly stopped breathing, thinking of the way he had been manipulated into taking his own father's life. He hated Lucius for the path he had set their family on, but...he didn't want to watch him die. He certainly didn't want it to be at the end of his own wand. He couldn't think about this. His breathing became erratic every time, the black stain inside him expanding like oily sludge choking through his body. 

Closing his eyes, Draco reached helplessly for the tiny magical thread that he knew was there. He didn't bother to pull on it since there was never any response, just....focused. There had been a moment the night he first woke, he had felt her. He was sure of it. But there had been nothing since he slammed his mental doors in panic that night. So, Draco occasionally just needed to know the thread was still there, even though that very need was ludicrous. Of course it was still there. The bond was at least partially responsible for his intense melancholy, he thought. 

He felt so....empty. There was so much longing, so much desire still burning in him. Sometimes when he woke, his body was ready for her. He would find himself reaching out for her. But she wasn't there. He didn't know where she was, and it was terrifying. More than the physical, he craved knowing how she was. He was more afraid for her than he was for himself or for Blaise, more than for his mother even. He shouldn't have felt that way. He should, for his own sake, be relieved she escaped this place and that should have been the end of it. He had tried to research bonds, but the book Mimsy had found for Granger, the one she took with her, must have been the only one in their extensive library worth reading on the subject. 

Draco sighed. He had only been awake for an hour so far and he already felt exhausted again. He would have to....

His thoughts cut off abruptly as the door to the infirmary opened and closed. He heard nothing, not even footsteps. He felt his heart hammering. Draco was at the very back of the infirmary with the curtains drawn around his bed and then disillusioned. No one would know he was there unless they went actively looking. Strictly speaking everyone knew he was here. But as long as no one was seeing him, it seemed he was mostly forgotten. He and Blaise had agreed to keep it that way as long as possible. 

Straining his ears, Draco realized he could hear panicked breathing. He wondered if someone was hurt. Should he risk himself to check? Would he know what to do or have the stamina to do it if they *did* need help? No. So he didn't move, focusing on listening and nothing else. After a few minutes a low, hoarse voice managed, ""It's just me, Drake. I made it back.""

As soon as Draco opened his eyes, they bulged. A very disheveled Blaise had sunk to the floor barely inside the door. Even from the back of the room, Draco could see his eyes squeezed closed and his arms pulled around himself, perhaps to hide the obvious shaking. He could tell his friend's breath was catching every few moments as though he was too traumatized to remember to keep breathing. He looked like he was overwhelmed with panic.

Despite how tired he felt, Draco drug himself off the bed and moved toward the front of the room, sliding down the wall next to his friend. ""What happened, Blaise?"" he asked, worried. His friend was pale and twitching. Up close, it was clear he had been crucioed recently. 

With a shaky breath, Blaise began to talk. ""I was making my rounds. You know there are people I have to check on daily. Either they want me to check their 'pets' or they prefer to be tended to in their rooms. Some want favors from me. Not as many since there have been more pets lately."" Draco put a steadying hand on his friend's shoulder. He was repulsed that their supposed own side would put him through that, but he couldn't say he was surprised. Fury burned in his gut, but Draco didn't have the energy to let it out. Besides, as much as he wanted to rage, that didn't seem to be what was needed at this moment.

Blaise took a deep shuddering breath and his voice dropped even lower. ""I haven't told you about this, Draco. I couldn't. I know you don't agree with the blood purity nonsense and all that, but sometimes you still hate them - the mudbloods or the blood traitors or just people who cross you. I'm sorry.""

Draco felt confused and he wasn't sure if it was the fuzziness in his head as his body begged for sleep again or if he had reason to be unsure. ""You didn't think you could tell me about the favors they make you do?"" He knew better than to think there was anything voluntary involved.

Blaise shook his head, though his eyes looked a little glassy at that. ""No. I'm not explaining very well. I mean, there was that, too, but the part I wasn't sure I could tell you is about helping the pets and the prisoners. I slip potions to those who need them. I give healing when I'm not supposed to. Take letters and send them to loved ones sometimes. Other....anyway. I help them. As much as I can without getting caught. I got caught today.""

Draco's eyes went wide. Fear coursed through his veins. ""What happened?"" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper he was so horrified. 

""Tonks. That Auror woman. I've been taking her a potion every day to keep her from getting pregnant. She's with Rowle. I think he's been pretty gentle with her for him, but he could change his mind any time. Probably will after today."" Blaise shuddered. ""He didn't want her on one. I take it he had some kind of crush on her back when they were in school. In his mind he wants to make her a proper wife - she's Black blood, you know?""

Draco felt startled for a moment before nodding, ""I know. I...she's my cousin.""

Blaise's eyes went wide. ""I had forgotten that. Andromeda.""

""Yeah. Blood traitors, though. So I've never met her or anything.""

Blaise nodded, ""If you survive this, by some miracle both of you, I think you should try meeting her. She's wicked."" 

Draco was relieved to see a smile on his friend's face for the first time since he made it back. It slipped fairly quickly, but it was important that it had been there. ""She has a baby back home somewhere. She doesn't need one here. He crucioed me a few times for it. But I would do it again. I will do it again. I don't even care if he catches me again. Every day I can get her that potion is another chance she might get out of here without another permanent reminder."" Blaise looked grim but determined. 

Draco opened his mouth to argue, but then he realized how unfair it would be considering how much he benefited from Blaise's devotion. Who else would have followed him into the pit of Death Eaters when he didn't have to? Of course the bastards had marked Blaise as soon as they could get their hands on him, but when it came out that he had been volunteering with Madame Pomfrey over the last few years, he had been set on this different path. Somehow, when Draco wasn't looking, the silent, angry Slytherin boy he had grown up with had become this soft-spoken vigilante healer. A younger Draco would have had something to say about how much his friend belonged in Hufflepuff these days. 

The Draco that was here today closed his mouth and put a hand on his friend's shoulder. ""If there is ever a way I can help, let me know."" They were both bloody Hufflepuffs these days. Maybe Gryffindors, actually, Draco thought of what he did to make sure Hermione got out. And there was the dull throb of emptiness again. ""I will,"" Blaise replied gravely. Then he pulled himself up off the ground, every movement slow, and offered a hand to Draco as well. ""You've been awake for almost two hours now. You're going to need to rest."" His voice was back in healer mode. 

""First, you need to take a potion for those tremors. I know this healer guy who makes just the thing for it,"" Draco quipped. His friend rolled his eyes, but grinned. When they reached the back of the room, Blaise split off to the potions cabinet while Draco dropped gratefully back into the infirmary bed. As he pulled the curtain back into place and turned to his patient, Blaise was swigging the potion he needed, but had another in his hand. It wasn't one Draco recognized offhand. He was too tired to comment.

""Hey, don't go under on me yet,"" Blaise said as Draco's eyes began to flutter. ""There's something important you need to take."" 

Draco focused his bleary too-tired eyes. Then he snapped them open when he realized what the potion was. Flicking his eyes up to Blaise's, he asked, ""Why do I need to take Draught of Living Death? Blaise?""

His old friend sighed and looked at the potion. ""I have to give a report to Lord Voldemort tonight on your health. I'm telling him you've slipped into a coma.""Draco sucked in a breath. ""How often am I going to need to take it?"" He tried to school his voice to sound brave. The thought of being practically dead for who knows how many weeks or months made him feel sick.

Thankfully, Blaise shook his head. ""It's just for tonight. Just in case the Dark Lord doesn't believe me and wants to come see for himself.""

Draco steeled himself and drank, collapsing immediately.

 

**************************************

 

The castle was mostly empty. The attack had come on the muggles, right in the middle of Piccadilly Circus, teeming with people. They had been lucky. Three Death Eaters had been sighted in the area before it started, so a quick Patronus back to Hogwarts and Remus had been able to dispatch enough people to be a few minutes ahead of the worst damage. The Ministry's obliviators were going to be very busy later today. If Voldemort even still cared about that.

What mattered to the Order was that they were saving countless lives, according to the Patronus reports regularly coming in. Ron had, of course, insisted on going along, but at least he was staying in touch as promised. So far.

Remus was tired of trying to make that boy see reason. Then again, he didn't feel much like listening to reason these days either. Not allowing Voldemort to take over the muggles was important work, but Remus had to wonder when his wife would be considered important enough work for a mission. 

He knew he shouldn't be thinking like that. Yet, as he headed for the hospital wing to assist with the first casualties coming in, Remus couldn't help but feel that his family deserved at least as much help as the Order was giving the muggles.

 

************************************

 

Blaise ducked into his suite and tried to calm his breathing as he felt the wards click into place and took a few moments to reinforce them. Lying to the Dark Lord was one of the most terrifying things he had ever done. If he weren't living in Malfoy Manor right now, with the constant threats and never-ending terror, he would have been able to say it was the most terrifying. He swore his brain was too jumbled to discern what specific thing was the most terrifying these days.

Lord Voldemort had laughed when Blaise told him that Draco was in a coma he might never come out of. ""That's the best way to keep his blood around for the wards,"" he had said. Greyback asked if he could have his way with the body. Blaise was so relieved when their Lord said no. Less relieved when he explained that he wanted the young Malfoy lord to be awake and aware when such things were happening to him, but at least they didn't believe that time was now. 

He was relieved Voldemort had not insisted on coming back with him. Blaise hated the rare times the snake man had ever come into his infirmary or lab. He would hate it even more with his best friend so vulnerable - and not just from the Draught of Living Death. 

Draco's magical core wouldn't heal. Blaise didn't know why, though his guess was the bond. He needed contact with Hermione to recover at anything faster than a snail's pace. He was making progress day by day, but so minimal it was hardly noticeable. He had overextended himself and stayed alive on magic alone, presumably hers. Blaise wondered if it was as hard a recovery for her. He knew Draco was trying desperately to hide how much the bond was affecting him. Between it and what happened with his parents, Blaise was concerned for his friend's mental well-being. Maybe under the Draught of Living Death wasn't a bad place for him to be right now.

Blaise almost wished he could take it himself. Rowle had been there tonight, Tonks firmly in place beside him. Her face had bruises and a split lip. She was fully dressed so he suspected there was a lot more damage he couldn't see. He knew he should have worried that Rowle would tattle on him to Voldy, but all he could really think about was what Rowle may have done to her and how long it might be before he was allowed to fix it. Maybe he would be able to tomorrow when he slipped her the potion.

Disgust filled him as he thought about how many ""pets"" had been on display tonight. The most prominent, of course, had been Bellatrix's toy. Charlie. She loved parading him around nude, rubbing it in the women's (and some of the men's) faces that she had such a gorgeous piece of manhood at her command. Watching the little touches she and the others forced on him had made Blaise's blood boil. Every casual brush of Charlie's body was a violation. Blaise's mind was working overtime to figure out some way to stop it, but he still couldn't come up with anything. 

He tried not to look at the man. He flushed with shame every time he did, his memories of helping that bitch degrade Charlie still fresh in his mind. Merlin, he couldn't stop thinking about it. He knew he had done what little he could to make it as pleasant as possible, but...he had still done it. Blaise was trying to clear his thoughts when he realized that he was looking again, only this time, the intense fire of Charlie's blue eyes met his from across the room. It was the look of a fighter, a survivor. Whatever happened, that man was going to fight free of this. Admiration washed through him and he gave the tiniest inclination of his head. Blaise doubted the tiny movement communicated anything useful, but he knew as he held that fiery gaze that he would do anything he could to help.

Blaise looked away. He needed to stay focused on the people he could help now. He had potions to brew and a couple of spells to research to perhaps help with the bond.

 

*************************************

 

Friday, May 22, 1998

Remus looked up from his desk as a tall figure entered the room. At first glance, she was similar to Bellatrix Lestrange. She had the same regal bearing, her high cheekbones, perfect posture, the curve of her nose. But this woman's hair was braided, showing the laugh lines on her tired face. In her arms, gurgling happily, was her grandson, Remus' baby boy. He was out of his seat in a moment, cooing at his son as he took the tiny little being into his arms. Andromeda smiled, but also gave a sigh of relief.

""He's two months old soon, you know. He hasn't seen his mother in weeks,"" the woman said. ""When are you going after her again, Remus?""

He looked up from his tiny son, whose hair had suddenly morphed pink as though he knew exactly who they were talking about. Remus knew the joy at seeing his son had slid from his face as he took in Andromeda's look. She was still smiling fondly at the baby, but there was a hard anger in her eyes. This wasn't fair and they both knew it. 

""It's a hard raid to plan, Andy. We've broken in there once. They're on guard for us even more now. It's not fair. I know. I feel like I'm giving them everything and getting nothing in return, but...what else can we do?""

""Remus, I am a patient woman. But I want my daughter back. I know you want your wife. Most important, this little guy needs his mummy. He's been sick the last couple of nights. It's the need for her, I think. Some babies just can't thrive without their parents. Please bring her home.""

He felt his heart breaking all over again. Remus looked down at his son, at his future. He would get her back. He would talk to Ron now. He nodded at Andromeda, too upset in that moment to speak. He handed his son back and said, ""I need to speak with the General. I hope you'll stay in the castle tonight. I need to spend time with Teddy.""

""Of course,"" she said. 

 

Remus threw open the doors of the meeting room, where Kingsley and Ron were chatting today. They had undoubtedly been going over what went right and wrong yesterday and what to do better next time. The two of them were thick as thieves these days. Both of them looked up at him and raised their eyebrows.

""Ron, Kingsley. I need my wife. Teddy has been sick. Andy says it's because he needs her. We've rescued the other prisoners, rescued muggles in broad daylight. I know it's hard to get back into Malfoy Manor, but it has to happen."" He slammed his fist down on the table.

Their eyes widened as he did. Ron particularly looked intimidated. ""Right,"" he said, ""I've been working on a plan, there's just always so much else to do.""

Remus growled and Ron hurried on, ""I mean...it's not that she's not important, too. But she's not going anywhere, you know?"" Realizing he had said the wrong thing, Ron put up both hands in surrender. Kingsley stood, trying to intimidate Remus back. 

""The boy misspoke,"" the tall man said. ""We've been working on a plan.""

""It's inspired by Dobby!"" Ron jumped back in. ""Kreacher used to go see Bellatrix sometimes, so I figure he should be able to pop a team in the way Dobby popped us out. Well, 2 teams of 4. One for Tonks and one for Charlie. He's not a huge fan of mine, but he will listen to Harry if he won't do it for me.""

The room suddenly became a flurry of activity as they decided to put the plan into action immediately. Within the hour, Remus and his team were ready, as was the team for Charlie. Standing here, knowing he was finally going to have Tonks back in his arms, he couldn't believe he had let them wait so long. 

Kreacher came when Ron called, but he was soon shaking his head. ""Would you do it for Harry if we get him?""

""No, sir. Kreacher cannot. The way to Mistress Bellatrix is closed. Kreacher's cousin came to stay. He was locked out, too.""

Every face was still. Everyone carefully did not turn toward Remus, whose breathing was becoming erratic. He tried to hold onto his temper. His wolf was too close, though. It was only a few days until the full moon. How could he be expected to hold on? Remus screamed, suddenly, a sound like a howl of rage. Before he could hurt anyone, he took off running to one of the unused classrooms - a place he could destroy without hurting anyone else. What else could he do in this moment? Malfoy Manor was a veritable fortress.

TRIGGER WARNING: Torture, references to rape/sexual slave situation

The second segment of this chapter is with Blaise, Charlie, and Bellatrix. There is no sex, but she's still cruel and batshit crazy. I'll summarize it at the end.

Saturday, May 23rd; evening


 


It came as a Howler, to his private chambers. It made sense, really. Did Greyback even know how to write? Besides, Remus couldn't quite imagine sitting down to a letter and reading the vitriol his sire had been spewing. He would have ripped it to shreds. He wanted to rip the whole world to shreds. 


 


... your bitch loves being with a real alpha... 


 


... the sweet sounds she makes while he ruts her... 


 


... kill the pup and she'll forget you ever existed... 


 


... taking her as his mate at the full moon... 


 


The phrases he had caught raced through his mind, through his wolf's mind. Some of it he just hadn't been able to process once the wolf was snarling so loudly. It didn't matter, really. It was all the same vein. Greyback had Dora and there was no way to get her back, no way to protect his mate.


 


It was so close to the full moon. Remus was shaking as he tried to figure out what he could do. The Order was useless to him. They had tried. And he knew they genuinely wanted to help. But there was no way into Malfoy Manor. 


 


Unless she wasn't in the Manor. If Greyback had her, if this was true... she might be with the pack instead. She might be where he could get to her. 


 


He should tell Kingsley and Ron. McGonagall. They would help him, wouldn't they? His chances of getting to her would be better with help. 


 


His wolf growled. They couldn't be trusted. No one could be trusted with his mate. 


 


Remus fought with the wolf. He should be able to make the choices here. But tomorrow was the full moon, and the wolf was looming large. 


 


Still, he left the room to seek out the other leaders. He was still a man and he would behave like one. Until he had that mongrel in his grasp and could rip his throat out with his teeth and claws.








OooOooOooOooOooOooO








Blaise was stunned when he stepped inside the LeStrange suite. It certainly wasn't the first time he had walked in on her torturing Charlie, but this was different. She didn't even notice him coming in, the first indication that something had changed. Bellatrix was ever-vigilant, well known for it. Part of him wanted to slide back into the servant's hall before she realized she had missed his entrance.


 


He couldn't do that, though, not when his help would so obviously be needed. And maybe... maybe he could intervene. 


 


For a few minutes, he just watched. The man was stretched between the end posts of the four poster bed, hanging by his rope-tied wrists. His back was torn, but nowhere near as badly as he had seen it in the past. Between each crack of her whip, Bellatrix was rubbing him fondly, not in a sexual way, just on his arm or side or face. She was saying something, but Blaise was too far away to hear what it was. Her tone indicated it was a question. 


 


Stubborn idiot. Blaise knew enough about the red-haired Gryffindor to know that what was going on undoubtedly had to do with a wrong answer to whatever that question was. He wasn't screaming either, which was likely causing Bellatrix to snap the whip harder. She hated it when her victims didn't scream. 


 


Charlie couldn't hold back a groan when the whip missed it's mark and slipped around to hit his cheek, nearly hitting his eye. Blaise was surprised that Bellatrix had lost that much control, but he could tell by the way she was fussing at his face, trying to dab the blood away with a cloth, that she had not done it intentionally. Her voice was frantic. As he approached, Blaise heard her words and nearly stopped in shock. 


 


""You know I don't have to punish you, pet. Please just tell me you're happy and I can stop. I want you to be happy, darling. Can't you see that?""


 


What the bloody fuck was this? Blaise was amazed she still hadn't noticed him. Charlie was too wrapped in his physical torment as she wrenched his head back by the hair to notice much of anything, but Bellatrix should have. He cleared his throat and both heads turned to him. Charlie looked startled, but then relief shone bright in his eyes when he registered it was him. 


 


Bellatrix was clearly furious... until she wasn't. Her face transformed as she smiled at him like he was her favorite person. ""Healer Zabini!"" she simpered. ""I think you can help me. Do fetch some happiness potion for me, lovely boy.""


 


""A calming draught? Yes, of course. I have one right...""


 


""No!"" Bellatrix snarled at him. ""A happiness potion. He's sick and can't be happy. Give him something that will fix him! I want him fixed!"" 


 


""Sick? What are his symptoms?"" Blaise snapped into full healer mode.


 


""I told you already!"" she screeched. Her next words were slow, like she was speaking to someone daft. ""He isn't 

happy

. Give him a potion to make him truly happy.""


 


Blaise stopped his careful approach and raised both hands in front of him in a calming motion. ""I'm afraid I don't know of any potions like that, Madame Lestrange. That isn't really how happiness works unfortunately.""


 


She blinked at him. ""What do you mean?"" 


 


She seemed honestly confused. Blaise swallowed hard, trying to figure out how to navigate this conversation without making the situation worse. ""Happiness isn't something that can be created for someone. We can do things for other people that may influence them, but happiness comes from inside.""


 


Bellatrix narrowed her eyes. ""So he could be happy and chooses not to be?"" Her tone was dangerous and Blaise could see her hand twitching on the whip. 


 


""No!"" he almost shouted. ""It isn't exactly something we decide. It's more... something that happens to us when the conditions are right. Like... like it would be very hard to be happy while someone is hurting you the way you're hurting your pet.""


 


Incomprehension was obvious on Bellatrix's face. ""But I love it when Rodolphus whips me.""


 


Blaise licked his lips nervously, trying to figure out how to get through to her while she seemed receptive. ""Well, different people do enjoy different things, so it is good that brings you happiness. But I think, for your pet, it just brings pain and unhappiness.""


 


""I'm... I'm making him unhappy?"" Bellatrix questioned, her voice breathy with shock.


 


""Yes, I'm afraid so,"" Blaise said, using his most calming voice.


 


She stormed over to Charlie and Blaise's heart dropped. Bellatrix grabbed the man's chin and pulled his head around so that he had to look at her. ""Is this true? Am I making you unhappy?""


 


When he didn't answer immediately, she jerked on his hair. An anguished sound rumbled out of him and he finally answered through gritted teeth. ""Yes, you are making me unhappy.""


 


Tears slid down Bellatrix's cheeks. ""I just want you to be happy, pet. You know you have to be punished when you aren't good.""


 


Charlie's chest heaved as he tried to breathe with his head pulled at such an odd angle. ""I can't tell you I'm happy.""


 


""Because you're not?"" she asked, sounding both astounded and desperately sad.


 


""I'm not,"" he repeated, his eyes closing. Blaise wondered if it was the pain getting to him or if he was just too emotionally drained for this bizarre conversation.


 


Blaise stepped closer, almost between them. ""Madame Lestrange, I think it would make him happier if you let me take him down and heal him now.""


 


""And then he'll be truly happy?"" she asked, like a small child. ""He needs to be happy.""


 


At a loss, Blaise asked, ""It would be a start. What kinds of things make you happy?"" he asked her. Then, thinking better of that, he rushed out, ""What made you happy as a child?"" 


 


Bellatrix looked puzzled for a moment. Blaise didn't dare move, though he was worried about Charlie. From this close, he could hear a tiny almost hysterical chuckle coming from the man. If he started laughing, there was no telling how Bellatrix might react and Blaise was hoping they were almost at a breakthrough. 


 


""Biscuits!"" Bellatrix suddenly squealed. ""Biscuits always made me happy!"" She was smiling like she had come up with Lord Voldemort's next evil plot.


 


Blaise put a steadying hand on Charlie's side as he heard the chuckles increase just that little bit more. When it didn't help, he brushed a finger against one of the wounds, making the man groan instead. He felt bad, but... it was all he could do to save him from himself. 


 


""Biscuits are delicious. They make lots of people happy,"" Blaise acknowledged. 


 


Bellatrix was radiant. ""Would you like some biscuits, pet?""


 


For a moment, Blaise feared Charlie wasn't going to answer. ""Yes. I like biscuits,"" he finally said. 


 


""They make you happy?"" she asked. 


 


There was a pause again before Charlie said, ""If they're my favorites they make me happy.""


 


Blaise froze. What was he playing at? Blue eyes met his brown, some desperate message he couldn't grasp pleading from their depths. 


 


Bellatrix looked irritated. ""Well which kind is your favorite?"" 


 


""My mum used to make these special pumpkin chocolate biscuits. They're a little tricky to make. You have to put in the chocolate right before they go in the oven or they aren't quite right. I'm not sure house elves would do it right,"" he explained gruffly. 


 


That was it. Blaise caught where they were going with this now. ""Madame Lestrange, perhaps it would be best if you supervise the house elves in preparing these special biscuits so they won't get it wrong. I'll take care of this mess while you're gone."" He gestured vaguely at the bed. 


 


""And when I come back he'll be happy?""


 


Blaise didn't dare look at Charlie. He just nodded and said, ""Of course, Madame.""


 


A dazzling smile crossed her face. ""What a splendid idea! I'll be back in a bit!""


 


With that, she flounced out the door and Blaise held his breath until he heard the lock click and the wards snap into place. 


 


""Fuck, she's crazy,"" Blaise swore. 


 


Charlie snorted, ""You have no idea.""


 


A few words of magic and Blaise had the other man laying on his stomach on the bed. Before he did anything else, he cancelled all the spells Bellatrix had on him. Charlie moaned in relief as his body practically melted into the mattress. 


 


""You bloody moron,"" Blaise muttered angrily as he began healing Charlie's back. Some of the lashes were going to scar, but it wasn't as though anyone would know the new ones from the numerous others. Between his former career and his far more dangerous situation here, the man was covered in them. ""Why the fuck didn't you just tell her you were happy?""


 


""I couldn't stand it,"" Charlie mumbled into the mattress. ""I already told her she was a good mistress. She made me say the words. I just... I couldn't...""


 


""Alright. Hush,"" Blaise said, his voice harsh. Seeing the damage these people did to their prisoners always bothered him, but it was doubly true with the burly dragon tamer, and so much worse when he truly could have stopped it himself with a single word. But when Charlie cringed at the tone of his voice, Blaise felt like he had beaten him, too.


 


""I'm just worried about you,"" he said softly. ""And angry that I can't stop it from happening."" He was done with his back, all the way down his legs. ""Turn over, Charlie. Let's see what else she's done to you."" He was concerned when Charlie whimpered a bit before slowly following his directions. 


 


Blaise looked down at him on the bed, scanning over him and noting the places he needed to work on. He was decisively trying not to linger where he most wanted to look but it was hard to ignore. ""I'm sorry. I thought I cancelled all her spells."" He started to whisper another 

finite incantatem

 but Charlie lightly touched his wrist before he could.


 


The redhead's whole body had flushed red. It made Blaise feel things he knew he shouldn't. Charlie's husky tone didn't help. ""You already did."" He wasn't meeting Blaise's eyes and his teeth were gritted together. 


 


It was suddenly hard to catch his breath through the tension in the room. Blaise closed his eyes and centered himself. ""That's a natural reaction to the healing. It doesn't mean anything.""


 


If anything, Charlie's blush intensified. His cock twitched but Blaise was trying very hard not to notice. ""Yeah,"" he replied, but it didn't seem true to either of them. Charlie was staring hard at the wall.


 


He busied himself with the healing he needed to do, mind whirring about how he should state his next question. It was standard for him when he was alone with any of the prisoners, but no matter how he phrased it right now, with the tension between them, Blaise was afraid it would come out wrong. As he checked the bandage around Charlie's neck and put a little more salve on the still-ugly wounds, he knew he had stalled long enough. 


 


""Is there... anything else that hurts?"" he stumbled over the words. 


 


Charlie gave a laugh that was entirely devoid of humor. 


 


""Shite! Not that,"" Blaise burst out. ""I really want to know if there's anything else I can do to help you but no matter how I say it's going to sound like a come on right now.""


 


Charlie was laughing for real now. He looked up and their eyes held for a moment before he blushed again and looked away. 


 


Blaise sighed. ""I... I don't mean that I wouldn't. If that's what you need... but I'm not... I would never try to make you... I... bollocks why is this all so fucked up?"" 


 


For a moment they were both quiet. The tension was still there, but it wasn't quite as intense. Charlie finally spoke. 


 


""I don't... need that. It's... she's already used me thrice today. And she's been letting me get off every time lately. That's what started all this today."" He sat up, shifting so that he could somewhat curl in on himself and hide his body. Blaise sat down a couple of feet closer to the top of the bed, handing over a pillow as he did. 


 


Charlie nodded his thanks, using it to cover himself, and continued, ""I was doing okay pretending. Merlin, I don't even have to pretend the pleasure anymore. She has me trained - I can't stop it."" His fists clenched. Blaise wanted to reach out for his hand but feared his touch wouldn't be welcome. ""But it's different the last few days. She wants it slow and... well, if she were anyone else I would say it's making love she wants instead of sex.""


 


Blaise couldn't hold back his sound of shock. Charlie didn't even look at him, just continued on with his story. ""So I managed, but the third time, I just. I couldn't fake wanting her again. She got angry. She hasn't been angry with me in days, not really. And it wasn't like her anger used to be. She... it's like she's obsessed. She doesn't seem to enjoy hurting me like she did at first. Obviously she still does it, but now it's like she does it because she thinks that's just what you're supposed to do. And, well, you heard her. She thinks that's what I want.""


 


Blaise wasn't sure how to respond. As far as he was aware, Bellatrix had never shown any inclination to care about anyone before this. She worshipped the Dark Lord. She obeyed her husband when it suited her. She enjoyed torturing as many people as possible and as far past their capability to cope as possible. That's as far as her emotions toward others went. She had never cared about something as mundane as basic happiness.


 


Charlie's voice was quiet. ""Blaise, I don't know how to deal with her now. I've worked so fucking hard to make her comfortable with me. Its working, but... she's so crazy, so unpredictable. If I say the wrong thing...""


 


Without thinking, Blaise did reach out now, their hands clasping without a second thought. 


 


""Well I can bloody well tell you that when she asks you the same question over and over because she doesn't like the answer, change to the one she wants to hear at some point before you get yourself killed.""


 


""I can't sometimes,"" Charlie said, his jaw tightening. 


 


""Hang your pride. Just get out of this alive.""


 


""Can I make it out alive if everything that is me dies?"" His hand clung to Blaise's as he asked the question, as much to himself as to Blaise. 


 


""You..."" Blaise started but then there was a sound in the hall. Bellatrix was yelling at someone. She sounded far more like her normal self. ""Shite!"" Blaise swore. He began quickly casting the spells she kept on the man. ""Do you want me to bind you or let her decide how she wants you?"" 


 


Charlie shuddered. ""Can you just tie my hands together, please?"" 


 


Blaise doubted she would let him stay that way, but he nodded and did it anyway, pulling his hand out of Charlie's as he finished. 


 


The other man tried to meet his eyes but had to look away. There were tears threatening if the glassy look in them meant anything. So softly he almost didn't hear it, Charlie whispered, ""I don't know how much longer I can keep on like this.""


 


Dropping into a crouch for just a moment so that their eyes were close, Blaise said, ""You can do this. Don't give up.""


 


The door sprung open and Blaise was standing with a bored look on his face as Bellatrix excitedly announced that she had the biscuits. Blaise tried not to bite his tongue cleanly off as he watched Charlie put on a perfect performance of loving them. 


 


""So you're happy now?"" Bellatrix asked gleefully. 


 


Blaise could see Charlie's Adam's apple bob as he swallowed hard. ""Yes.""


 


There was a resounding crack as she slapped him hard. Sounding much more like her normal self, Bellatrix demanded, ""That's not how you address me, pet. Yes what?""


 


""Yes, mistress. You have made me very happy."" Charlie's voice was strong despite the bruise already blooming across his face. 


 


""Would you want someone else to take care of you?"" She asked. 


 


Without a moment's pause, Charlie said, ""No, Mistress. I am happy here. Being your pet makes me happy.""


 


Bellatrix was thrilled, petting him like a dog and entirely missing the looks of absolute hatred that crossed the man's face when she looked away. 


 


As soon as he could, seeing that Charlie was as close to safe as possible for now, Blaise claimed additional patients to see and left before he could be sick. 








OooOooOooOooOooOooO








It was a rose garden where she was walking. She wasn't sure where, though there was a giant building off in the distance - a manor, perhaps? The scent of the roses was pleasant. Everything about this place was calming. 


 


She walked until her legs were tired, enjoying the quiet restfulness. When she needed to sit, a fountain appeared before her, the edge wide enough to act as a bench. She sat down, splashing her hands delicately through the water.


 


There was a sound in front of her, so she turned to see. A small fox wove in and out of the greenery. As she watched, she felt a weight on her lap. It wasn't alarming. It felt right. She was idly running her hands through the softest hair as she watched the fox. 


 


Looking down, she saw a halo of white blond hair framing a pointed but well-crafted face. He was beautiful, almost angelic in his sleep. Of their own accord, her fingers traced his high cheekbones and caressed his full lips.


 


Silver eyes flickered open, meeting hers and making her shiver from their intensity. He blinked, once, twice. 


 


""Hermione?"" His voice was uncertain, but filled with a wonder and longing that matched something deep within herself. 


 


She couldn't seem to speak, but she nodded. She brushed her hand through his hair again, letting her fingers linger along the side of his face. A part of her wanted to lean down and feel his plump lips against her own. He was reaching for her, too. She knew he would pull her down to him and a feeling of completion swept through her just from his touch.


 


Hermione woke with a start. Was that... had she just had a dream featuring Draco Malfoy? A good dream, at that. She must have eaten something bad the night before or something. 


 


Sitting up, she was surprised by how very well rested she felt. For the first time in what felt like weeks, she wasn't empty and restless. Smiling, she decided she might as well get up even though it was the middle of the night. There was plenty of research to do after all.









Summary of triggering section:Bellatrix is being crazy in a different way. She is obsessed with Charlie being happy and doing out of character things like wanting slow almost ""making love"" sex and not enjoying hurting Charlie. They convince her to go supervise the elves making biscuits so that Blaise has time to do some healing and he and Charlie have a heart to heart (as well as some awkward sexual tension since Charlie can't hide his physical response) and Blaise encourages him not to give up.

No triggers. I'm so excited about this chapter!

Sunday, May 24, 1998; late evening


 


Hermione was absorbed in her work. She sat at the table in the kitchen, one hand scrawling notes while the other held her book open as she read feverishly. Her hair was a wild mess, with a quill tucked in to hold some of it out of her way. 


 


She had been going all day, surrounded by books and notes, scribbling here and there about her findings. Fleur was worried about her, she knew, but Hermione was terrified the castle full of her friends would be attacked without proper protection. 


 


""How can we be almost a month out from the battle and the walls haven't even been repaired!?"" Hermione kept thinking. She didn't mean to say it out loud, but sometimes she couldn't help it through her frustration. Poor Bill had looked quite sheepish at having been unable to figure out how to do the wards when she asked.


 


He didn't have to explain himself, though. Hermione understood he was one of the best curse breakers money could buy. He was good at wards, but his specialty was breaking through them, not creating new ones with unfamiliar, ancient magic. As far as Bill was aware, and even after consulting with others, it was no one's specialty. They had a letter out to a witch in Amsterdam who was known for her work repairing ancient wards. That was the closest they had found to someone who might know.


 


Frustration was getting to her now. Bill had given up and gone to bed already. She was determined not to do that, but there just wasn't enough information in the books she had. She needed the Hogwarts library. And to scour the Headmistress' library. She wondered if there was any way she could cloak her bond for a brief period. She would have to talk to Bill about it in the morning. Just a few hours of research would help. 


 


Hermione rubbed her tired eyes. She had felt so much better in the wee hours this morning, but it had been a very long and mentally taxing day. She knew she was still recovering from the last time she sent her magic along the bond and should rest more, but this was so important. She was happy that at least the ache in her body, that emptiness she often felt, was missing today. But food had been difficult throughout the day. Hermione struggled to keep anything down. Perhaps she actually had a bug of some sort on top of the magical drain recovery.


 


""Mistress Hermione needs hers bed.""


 


The girl in question squeaked at Mimsy's sudden appearance by her side. The problem with Mimsy was that, in such a small space as the cottage, she saw no point in apparating. It turned out house elves were very good at moving around silently when they didn't make a pop sound each time they did something. ""Mimsy,"" Hermione sighed, ""Please don't sneak up on me. You scared me!""


 


""Mimsy be sorry, Mistress,"" clearly not a bit sorry. ""Yous be up too long. Drinks yous tea I brings you then bed for yous!"" Mimsy spoke in her most commanding no-nonsense voice. Hermione internally giggled at how very commanding it really was. She couldn't quite imagine who must have owned this little elf before and let her boss them around so much. Whoever the mysterious Master was, he must be a decent fellow.


 


""Yes, Mimsy,"" she agreed wearily. She really was too tired to get much else done, even if there had been anything left to research here. Mimsy nodded her head once and then settled into a nearby chair to watch. Hermione smiled into her teacup as she worked on drinking it down. It was amazing how much it helped her stomach calm. With a smile at her mother hen, Hermione headed off to bed.








*******************************








Remus paced his room. The wolf had won out - he had told no one of the communication from Greyback. His human side was still trying to think sensibly, but it was hard to know the right path when he so badly needed his mate back. His Dora. Their cub needed his mother. Teddy, his human side reminded.


 


It was time to head to the Shrieking Shack, but it didn't feel right. This was his chance, the only one if Greyback was going to mark Dora as his mate tonight. Remus the man might not be strong and powerful enough to break her free alone, but Lupin the werewolf was very strong, very powerful. 


 


He stared at the wolfsbane potion sitting on his desk. He hadn't taken it when Snape brought it by. He had it earlier in the week. He wouldn't change at the first peek of the moon, and when he did change he might still be somewhat in command of his senses. That his goal and the wolf's were the same meant that it didn't entirely matter to him whether he was completely in control or not. There wasn't a Death Eater or dark werewolf he would feel remorse about attacking, and his wolf wouldn't harm Dora.


 


Opening a drawer of his desk, he pulled out a small box with the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes logo on the top. It was experimental, one of their line of Order products, but the twins, back when it was still both of them, had assured him it had been tested twice already and had yet to fail. He had been holding it back in case it was essential for a mission. 


 


It might be essential for his mission tonight. Yes, Greyback had implied that she was in the forest with him. He hoped it was true because it would make her far easier to find and rescue, but he needed to be prepared in case he still needed to get past the wards of the manor. He only hoped that if it was needed, there would be enough human in control to remember the little box.


 


Mind made up, Remus wrote a quick note and left it on his desk, in case anyone should come looking for him. Typically, one of the younger ones met him at the Whomping Willow to ensure he got to the Shack safely. It wouldn't be unprecedented, however, for him to have already gone there earlier in the day. If it weren't already so late, he would go leave a note saying as much. He was sure they would figure it out, though. Or come here and read this note. Perhaps it would even mean moving their hands on attacking the manor. Whatever happened, he was getting Dora back tonight.









He apparated to a point he remembered in the woods near the Manor. He could already hear howls. He would need to be very careful to avoid the wolves and the moon until he was ready to change. Well, avoid the wolves while also seeking them out. If Greyback stuck to his usual patterns, there would be a clearing somewhere that the pack used as a base. It would be where they went to change, where challenges happened. 


 


Remus did his best to be stealthy, but he was no match for the werewolves who lived here. He was only lucky that a pair of wolves who hadn't turned yet were the ones who captured him and hauled him straight to the clearing. 


 


It turned out that Greyback was waiting for him - and thoroughly anxious to turn himself, hence the impatience. The beast must want to talk and taunt first. As much as he feared the worst, Remus was encouraged that Greyback must not have taken her yet. His heart was hammering, but he was determined to triumph tonight.


 


The Alpha began to laugh when he saw Remus there at the edge of the clearing, still a man. ""I knew you would come tonight, pathetic excuse for a wolf.""


 


""Where is my mate?"" Remus growled.


 


""You're really stupid enough to think our Dark Lord would allow her out here in the woods when she's one of our favorite prisoners? I wouldn't take your leftovers as a mate, 'specially not now. The whore has been passed around too much.""


 


Remus felt his blood turn cold then boil. He had to get to her tonight. He knew now that there would never be another chance. He was going to break Dora free and then take down his sire. If he gained control of the pack in the process, all the better. His hand slipped into his pocket as Greyback continued telling him how much he and everyone else enjoyed using his wife. Avoiding the little box he would be using soon, Remus found the little packet of Peruvian Darkness. WIthout bothering to reply to Greyback, he threw the packet and dodged past his captors while they were lost in the dark.


 


Taking a deep breath, he now pulled out the little box and flipped the top open. Racing for the edge of the wood, he made it to the front gate of Malfoy Manor before the wolves howling behind him had managed to catch up. He wished there was a secondary gate somewhere, but no matter. He would take out the guards there with little trouble. That would be enough to call out some more of the Death Eaters as well. His wolf mind was excited as he pressed the button inside and hurled the little box at the wards and gate, stepping out into the moonlight at the same time. 


 


His transformation kept him from fully seeing the way the box hit the wards mid-air, shattering the gates beneath them and causing a jarring bright light to explode across the wards themselves. The guard who wasn't killed instantly by the blast leapt to his feet, finding himself facing the enraged werewolf Lupin. 



 



******************************************








Lord Voldemort laughed his high-pitched, eerie laugh as he crucioed his loyal servant Nott, again, for having still not located his son. 


 


""My Lord, please,"" the man begged. ""I'm certain the brat is dead.""


 


""Then why have you not recovered his body?"" the Dark Lord demanded.


 


""I... I believe the Order murdered him and hid it,"" Nott insisted.


 


""Why would they do that when they have done it to no other?""


 


The senior Nott paused too long and his body again began convulsing before he could answer. Charlie was grateful that, without the compulsions on his bandage turned collar, he was able to keep his eyes down and not actually watch the torture. Even when it was one of their own, someone who deserved it, he hated watching. Hearing it was bad enough.



Charlie was kneeling in place beside Bellatrix, up on the dais. His knees hurt, but he was happy she wasn't making him stand on display anymore. Her weird obsession now included a possessiveness she hadn't displayed before. She didn't want the other Death Eaters looking at him, much less touching him. 


 


She still brought him everywhere with her and paraded him around, but when people touched, she no longer laughed about it and taunted him. Sometimes she would ignore it. More often she glared them down. Just tonight for the first time, she had actively removed a man's hand from his body and told him not to touch her pet again. 


 


Of course he was relieved, but Charlie was also scared. What happened if Voldemort noticed that she was now 

too

 attached to him? Would he be reassigned to someone else? He couldn't survive it. He knew, deep down, that he would find a way to kill himself if he had to go through the whole process of building trust again. Death had to be better than this. 


 


His eyes met Tonks' across the room. Today's face was a blonde with boils all over her. He recognized it easily from school. She had used the boils more than once to skip out of classes. She was covered in bruises, but he could tell her spirit was still in there. More than his right now. Merlin, he wished he could talk to her for a few minutes. 


 


His attention was pulled back to the floor in front by the screeching of an angry woman. What was this? He had missed something. Nott was now off to the side glowering at a girl, probably about Ron or Ginny's age, who was actively screaming obscenities - at the men handling her, at Nott off to the side, and even at Voldemort himself. Charlie felt his heart clench.


 


But Lord Voldemort laughed. ""What a feisty little thing,"" he said, amusement pouring from his mouth. ""Bring her up. The marriage happens now.""


 


As the ceremony commenced, Charlie tried to pay attention. He felt like he owed anyone else in these positions at least the courtesy of bearing witness. The girl was apparently a Parkinson. Pureblood, not typically Blood Traitors. That explained why she was being married to someone instead of given away as a pet. He felt like there was something familiar about her, but he had no idea. The holes in his memory felt larger every day. Whether he knew her or not, he was silently begging they didn't have to watch Nott rape her. Bellatrix would no doubt insist they have a front row seat for it. Of course the Death Eaters considered that the best part of the marriages performed for Voldemort's amusement.


 


""Nott, this is another chance I'm giving you. Get her under control within 2 weeks, or I kill you,"" Lord Voldemort gave a sick smile. ""Now, it's time for the entertainment. Everyone make a circle around the happy couple.""


 


Charlie thought he might throw up as Bellatrix gathered his leash and prepared to stand, a wicked gleam in her eyes. Before she could, however, there was a blast, reverberating around the entire manor as wards went down. There were screams and angry shouts. 


 


Lord Voldemort rose from his throne, ""We are under attack. Kill them all, whoever they are. I do hate it when our entertainment is interrupted.""


 


Howls sounded. Something was going on with the werewolves, though how they could have breached the wards, Charlie had no idea. The collected Death Eaters ran for the door. Any who had brought pets or prisoners drug them along.


 


Bellatrix yanked on his leash, but then turned, her eyes large and round. Behind her, Charlie could see that the Dark Lord had begun gliding across the room to the front hall. There were sounds of shouted spells intermingled with snarls and howling.


 


There was a look of conflict on Bellatrix's face. Her voice was very small when she said, ""I want you to be safe. You could be hurt out there.""


 


Charlie swallowed hard. Could she be thinking... 


 


""Do I still make you happy, pet?""


 


""Yes, Mistress. You make me very happy."" Anything. He would agree with anything right now if she let him stay behind.


 


The crazed woman looked down at him with trusting eyes, ""Will you be a good pet and sit right here while I'm gone?""


 


""Yes, Mistress, of course,"" he said, trying to keep the elation out of his voice. 


 


She leaned down, petting his hair until she jerked his head back by a hunk of it and kissed him hard. Charlie whimpered, but bowed his head in submission when she finished. His heart was pounding as he heard her running from the room.


 


His chance had finally come.







I'm sorry. Just... really sorry, folks. 

WARNING: Character Death

 

The sandbox still belongs to Rowling, but I enjoy playing in it.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Sunday, May 24, 1998; late night








Looking over her shoulder as Rowle drug her from the ballroom, Tonks saw that Voldy was headed out behind them. As usual he was letting his Death Eaters take the brunt of whatever was happening, but she was surprised to see that Bellatrix was also lingering. Her normal place was gleefully on the front lines doing as much damage as possible. Instead, she was petting Charlie. 


 


Tonks wanted to watch, see what happened, but Rowle shoved her roughly through the door, his hand gripping her collar tightly. The compulsions were always stronger if he touched it.


 


""You will go back to my room. You will be waiting for me on the bed when I arrive, however long it may take. And you're going to look like yourself. Now, bitch. All of it.""


 


She hated that her face and hair instantly became her own. She hated it even more that she turned and started down the hallway as he had commanded. She was at least able to look behind her, seeing Rowle rushing out the front door, the Dark Lord following not far behind. Finally, Bellatrix came rushing out of the ballroom alone - she must have sent Charlie back to her bedroom - and started toward the front door. The sounds of shouted spells were louder now. Tonks found her feet moving faster to head up the staircase to the second floor bedrooms.


 


A howl sounded. She knew it must be from the woods beyond the gates, the wards. Logic said it was Greyback or one of his pack. But it wasn't. Tonks knew that howl, knew what it meant.


 



No.



 


Her thoughts were spinning. No compulsion in the world could keep her moving up those stairs with Remus out there. She turned and raced down the stairs toward the door.








OooOooOooOooOooO








Headmistress McGonagall looked up wearily as Luna Lovegood burst into the room. It was odd enough for that girl to be in a rush that Minerva pushed herself up from her chair to address her.


 


""Miss Lovegood? What is the matter?""


 


Luna's normal vague look was reduced, worry working its way in, ""Professor Lupin didn't come to the willow tonight, Professor. It's usually ok, of course. Sometimes he goes early. I thought about just going for a nice walk to see if the wempwillies were in bloom yet. You know how the pluffobies enjoy snacking on them on a full moon. But when I started that way there were so many nargles I just knew that wasn't what I should be doing. So I went up to knock on Professor Lupin's door. Of course, on the way, I ran into a nest of doluemberrs that were...""


 


""Miss Lovegood. What did you find in Lupin's room?"" Minerva had a bad feeling about this the longer the girl went on.


 


""Oh,"" looking stricken, she handed Minerva the note. 










I'm getting her out of there tonight, while I have the strength and power to do so. I will not give up my mate to Greyback. I've taken a product to take down the wards. Come join the fun if you find this before I'm back. Tell Teddy we love him and I'm bringing his Mummy back to him.



Remus 


 


Minerva felt herself beginning to shake. ""Thank you, Luna,"" she said as she ran from the room, racing for the planning room. 


 


She felt something akin to panic as she burst into the room, ""Ronald! Kingsley! That idiot went to Malfoy Manor to change!""


 


""What?"" They both looked up at her with identical confused but concerned expressions. Nothing flustered Minerva. She knew they couldn't imagine what had happened. She had read the note and she couldn't believe it. She thrust it into their waiting hands, letting both of them see it at once. 


 


""Surely he didn't,"" Kingsley said.


 


""No,"" Ron groaned, ""This is my fault. He did it because I hadn't come up with a way to get her out yet.""


 


Pulling herself together, Minerva said, ""Ronald, there's no sense in blaming yourself or anyone else right now. We need to get people on the ground there. Perhaps it's not yet too late.""








OooOooOooOooOooO








Legs shaking, Charlie stood up, stretching his body slowly to keep from letting his legs cramp. He might not ever have this chance again. Kneeling at his Mistress' side, there had been plenty of time to memorize the room in front of him. He knew, off to the right behind a tapestry, there was some sort of hidden hallway. He had seen house elves appear from behind it often enough to be sure. 


 


Quickly and quietly, he made his way to it, sliding behind the heavy material to see what he would be working with. The space behind was dimly lit but clearly did move away from the ballroom. If he had to guess, Charlie would assume it went to the kitchens at the back of the house. As much as he could, he had memorized the layout of the manor. Bellatrix was constantly visiting ""the lessers"" as she referred to all the rest of the Death Eaters. 


 


Despite losing Neville Longbottom, she had still somehow retained favor with the Dark Lord. Perhaps, he thought bitterly, it had something to do with how much they had all enjoyed watching her with himself. He shuddered and reminded himself that was the reason he had to get out of here. His eyes were quickly adjusting to the dark hallway. He realized that there were doors all along it, though some looked more used than others. That could be useful if it led him to an unused room he could hide in. 


 


Down the long hall, he heard a noise like someone running down stairs. He tried to press himself against the wall but realized the elf or person making that noise was moving fast enough that they must be able to see. His only chance would be to try one of the doors that looked unused and hope it went to a room that wasn't occupied. 


 


Choosing a door, Charlie turned the old knob and shoved as hard as he could, hearing footsteps coming ever closer. Two things suddenly happened at once. A body hit him hard, throwing him up against the wall next to the door. A slim, familiar hand was on his chest while the rest of the man's body stood away from him. At the same moment, the door Charlie had been pushing on flew open from the other side, an angry wizard leaning in.


 


""So sorry, sir,"" a smooth, low voice came from right beside him, Blaise's body blocked him from sight while he addressed the wizard in the outer room. Charlie swore he could feel the deep rumble of that soothing tone coming through the hand into his chest. Even though his heart was pounding with fear, he felt himself calming by the second. ""I tripped running through the servant's hall here. Our lord needs me immediately in the throne room. I suspect there will be a show soon. Perhaps you should head down as well."" 


 


There was an angry grumble from the other side, ""See that you don't bother my door again,"" before the wizard slammed it shut and they were alone.


 


The hand moved from Charlie's chest to tug at his hand, pulling him rapidly several doors down before shoving him onto the opposite wall. Blaise was suddenly flush against Charlie, the cloth of his robes pressing against Charlie's naked skin and making him shudder from the sudden warmth. With his mouth directly against Charlie's ear, Blaise whispered, ""Four doors then turn the corner to your right. Take the staircase on your left. Straight up it, then left, pass 4 doors, turn right and all the way to the end of the hall. The next to last door is the infirmary. You should be safe there. Find somewhere to hide inside, just in case.""


 


With that, the man was gone and Charlie was alone again, shivering from the chill.








OooOooOooOooOooO








Lupin made quick work of the guard, and was pleased to see that Death Eaters were coming out of the manor running toward him. The part of him that was still Remus reminded his wolf they weren't 

just

 there to fight - that they needed to head in through the broken wards and get through to their mate. 


 


Lupin gave his wolfish grin and loped toward the manor. When he hit the ward line, he felt a momentary zap of energy before he found himself flying backwards through the air. He heard laughter from the Death Eaters before him. Howling with rage, he tried again. It threw him back again, singeing his fur as he hit. 


 


The first of the Death Eaters reached Lupin, the brand on the man's arm glowing as he stepped across the ward. Like most of them, this weak man hadn't bothered to throw on robes, so Remus recognized him as MacNair. Of course. He was always ready to put down a beast. The wolf ripped out his throat at that thought, spinning to face the next to come. 


 


A spell hit his side as he did, blasting him backward as a gash opened up where it hit. Lupin howled, leaping to his feet and attacking Rookwood, the next to reach him. He felt bone crunch beneath flesh as he bit into the man's shoulder, his claws raking along him as well. 


 


Lupin yelped and let go as a wizard just behind the wards shot him with a slicing hex. Rookwood scrambled away as a man started laughing. The werewolf spun to face the sound. Thorfinn Rowle stood, laughing, with a wicked grin on his face. ""Remus Lupin? Looking for your wife? The bitch isn't yours now. I own her. I fuck her whenever I want and I make her scream 

my

 name. That cunt is mine.""








OooOooOooOooOooO


 


Ron landed at the edge of the woods with his forces. He had pulled out everyone available. They were to stay in groups of no less than four. Who knew how many werewolves were out in this forest tonight? 


 


The groups quickly began to spread out, but it was obvious where they all needed to go. Wild howls were coming from the same direction as angry shouts. Both sounds led directly toward flickering lights that could only be Malfoy Manor. The varying colors of those lights told Ron that the brightness ahead was a vast number of spells lighting the night.


 


Fearing for Remus, Ron wanted to rush forward as some of his troops were doing. Instead, he signaled to his partners - Finian, Cho, and Luna - to hold back, moving cautiously forward. He was glad they had as there were werewolves circling, drawn toward the howls even more intensely than the Order was. 


 


They took out a couple of them as they snuck along, but in the distance, Ron could hear shouts that he suspected were his brother, proclaiming a kill. It terrified him that George might be provoking the beasts, but there wasn't a thing he could do about it right now. Especially as they had just come to the end of the forest where it opened out in front of the gates. 


 


Well, what had been the gates. They were a gnarled mess at the moment. Ron wondered what could have reduced the imposing structure to melted pools of metal, but he didn't have to wonder very long.


 


Taking in the scene, his eyes were drawn to a werewolf he knew. Remus growled where he stood then made a wild leap toward a man on the other side of the line. For a moment it seemed he might be successful, but then there was a snapping sound and he was thrown back by the wards, letting out a yelp as he fell.


 


Rowle leaned down and picked something up. Ron couldn't tell exactly what the little box had been, but he recognized the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes logo on the side, even with half of it gone. 


 


""Hmmm. The Dark Lord will be interested to see this. It seems to have done a rather good job on most of the wards."" Rowle looked up at Remus. ""If you were going to get out of here alive, I would suggest you report back that they're useless against blood wards. Shame you won't get the chance."" 


 


Ron heard Fin's shout before he could stop him. ""He'll get out. Don't you worry about that!""


 


The hulking Viking of a man turned to their group, scanning the area. ""Maybe someone will survive to get the message through since your little friends are here now. Wouldn't count on it, but it could happen.""


 


Ron found that a collection of nasty spells were now aimed their way by the Death Eaters on the lawn. He was dodging and returning fire, but his attention, and thankfully theirs too, was really held by the scene unfolding before them.


 


There was a snarl to Remus's side, just as he was knocked off his feet by another huge wolf. His sire, his mortal enemy - Greyback. Remus was in a fight for his life and Ron was ashamed to admit he didn't believe his friend would be the one who lived. 


 


The two werewolves were interlocked. Both were snarling and biting. Greyback was so much larger, and working without the gashes Lupin had already taken to his back and sides. Remus did the only thing he could. He squirmed under his larger opponent and began biting under his belly and up toward his neck. Greyback attacked the smaller wolf's back, but couldn't get an easy hold. Remus was slipping repeatedly out of Greyback's grasp. 


 


Remus was covered in blood, but he finally got his jaws around Greyback's neck. Ron was shocked when Remus crushed his windpipe. He started to shake his prey, delivering the final kill, when a scream split the air. 


 


Ron gasped. He knew that voice. ""REMUS!"" Ron couldn't believe it was truly Tonks, right there,  running as fast as she could to get to her husband, just ahead of her. Remus began untangling himself from Greyback's mangled remains, his eyes glued to the sight of his wife. Ron noticed that the Death Eaters were letting her run without a single move to stop her and a sinking feeling settled in his stomach.


 


The Death Eaters began to laugh as Tonks ran straight into the ward. She screamed as it threw her back and the magical energy crackled with a fire of its own. Tonks was sobbing, Remus so close but untouchable. On the other side, he howled as he reached out for her.


 


Rowle was suddenly beside them, fisting her hair and yanking her to him. Staring straight into the werewolf's eyes, he kissed the struggling woman, then fondled along her body as he laughed at Remus's attempts to get inside. 


 


""Bellatrix?"" Rowle called, ""Do you want to play with this little whore tonight? Bet you and your pet would enjoy having her."" 


 


The woman in question gave a purely evil smile and put her hands on Tonks as well, effectively freeing up Rowle's wand hand. 


 


Remus was losing what little human part of his mind he had still possessed. Howling and surging forward, he never saw the shot of green light coming from Rowle's wand. 


 


It hit him in the center of his chest and Remus was gone. 


 

SO SORRY!

I fully expect some upset/angry comments on this one, but please remember I'm a real person and don't be *too* harsh.

Thank you everyone who stayed for not absolutely blasting me after that last chapter. I really enjoyed all the thoughtful, heartfelt reviews. I've not been in the best place mental healthwise the past few weeks, so your comments give me a big boost. Please keep 'em coming. I love knowing what you think, even if it's that you don't like what I'm doing. 

I don't think there are any specific trigger warnings for this chapter.

 

JK Rowling still owns the characters. So on and so forth.


Sunday May 24, 1998; late night


 


The door to the servant's hall began to slowly open only minutes after Blaise had left. Draco was surprised and almost called out, but something seemed off. Why would his friend be moving so slowly when he had been in such a rush only minutes before? The creak of the door silenced any reaction.


 


His first instinct was to hide. Draco had to remind himself that he was actually safer lying in bed than he would be if he moved, though he did grab his wand. The disillusionment would keep anyone from seeing him as long as he stayed put and they didn't actively run into him, even if they looked behind the curtain.


 


There was a shuffling sound as the door closed and the person came inside, but they didn't speak or settle anywhere to wait. It was like they hadn't expected to be here at all and were just trying not to touch anything. Suddenly, there was a loud clatter as a table of equipment and potion bottles fell sideways and crashed to the ground.


 


""Holy Mother-of-Merlin's Saggy Left Tit. I'll be the bloody fucking death of myself,"" a voice whisper-shouted. Draco couldn't help but sputter and laugh. Who 

was

 this guy? He didn't recognize the baritone voice. 


 


When the curtain was jerked back, it revealed a very muscular, very nude redhead with a deadly look on his face. ""Who's there? I heard you and I know you're here.""


 


Draco also didn't recognize the man himself, though the collar on his neck, the only thing he was wearing at all, indicated he was the pet his aunt had been keeping.


 


Draco drew back rapidly before he could stop himself, the movement breaking the disillusionment, and aimed his wand at the man. In the back of his mind, Draco knew it was stupid, but his mouth had taken over, ""Red hair? Never seen one so poor he didn't 

have

 any clothes, but are you a Weasley?"" He was immediately cursing himself and internally begging that the man's response was confusion rather than fury.


 


To his surprise, the redhead laughed quietly, though his face was still grim. ""I am, actually. And you're the Malfoy boy, aren't you?"" 


 


Though he clearly felt minimal embarrassment at his state, the man had moved the curtain so that it was between his lower half and Draco. He was less disconcerting to look at that way, Draco had to admit. Remembering finally that he had been spoken to, Draco nodded. 


 


His head spun a little when he did. He hated how weak he still felt. There had been a dream a few nights ago, one of the real ones. It had helped tremendously, but... he just needed that witch so damn badly. Merlin, he couldn't even focus on what was happening around him. He needed to know what was going on here and now.


 


""What's your name?"" Draco asked, ""Besides Weasley.""


 


""Charlie. The dragon tamer. Second oldest. Former Gryffindor Quidditch Captain. Most people your age have never heard of me since I'm the one that ran off to a foreign country."" 


 


Draco nodded. He actually had heard of him, but he wasn't going to say so. He raised his wand again. ""What are you doing here?""


 


""Hiding,"" the redhead said. ""You?"" He didn't seem phased by the wand in his face.


 


He couldn't help it. Draco rolled his eyes and said, ""Healing.""


 


The man stared at him for a moment, his lips quirking, before he nodded. ""Fair thing to do in an infirmary, I suppose. Do you... know the healer well?""


 


Draco's mind was spinning. Did Blaise know this was happening? Was he supposed to pretend they weren't close. Fuck. How was he supposed to know what was going on when he had been trapped here for so long? ""Everyone knows Zabini,"" he hedged. ""Are you here because... did he send you here?""


 


Charlie stared at Draco. His face was blank, but Draco could almost feel his nervousness rolling over him. Finally, the redhead said, ""I found my way here."" As he spoke, he looked around at the infirmary with purpose in his gaze. ""Don't suppose there are any clothes around here that I could borrow?""


 


After a moment of thought, Draco nodded. ""I can get you some of the healer's. I don't know how well any of it will fit. You're about the same height but you're... a bit more filled out than he is.""



 



Charlie snorted in a way that suggested he was familiar enough with Blaise to be aware of that. 



Draco wished again that he knew what the hell was going on and how Charlie had ended up specifically here in the infirmary. It was a long way from any of the areas Bellatrix tended to frequent. Draco had a feeling, but... if he was wrong, he was inviting a lot of danger into their lives and without Blaise's approval. On the other hand, if he was right, Blaise was inviting that danger in without consulting 

him

 so maybe he wouldn't need to feel so guilty.


 


""What was your name, by the way? You don't act much like any Malfoy I've ever heard of. I'd hate to call you after them.""


 


""Draco,"" he replied, feeling weirdly shy about it. 


 


""Dragon? Really? No wonder I like you."" Charlie gave a quiet laugh. Draco was confused. Surely he should be more terrified and frantic.


 


Slowly, Draco had made his way off the bed and toward Blaise's room. Charlie caught his arm once when it seemed like he might fall. 


 


""If you don't mind my asking,"" the redhead began, ""what happened to you?"" 


 


""The Dark Lord,"" Draco answered in a bitter tone. 


 


Charlie nodded. No further explanation was needed for anyone who had been living here any length of time.


 


Rubbing the back of his neck, Draco added, ""Should you get recaptured and anyone asks... I'm in a coma right now, yeah?""


 


Charlie's eyebrows rose at that, but he nodded again.


 


""I'm only alive at this point to hold the blood wards. We're hoping they've mostly forgotten I exist,"" Draco found himself explaining, though he owed this man nothing.


 


By this point, Draco had managed to rummage through all of Blaise's things, finally coming across a t-shirt and some sleep pants in a bottom drawer. Charlie squirmed his body into them. They were tight, but better than nothing. Draco wasn't sure where they came from. They weren't the sort of thing Blaise typically wore. But they were the closest to Charlie's size. He might burst out of them, Draco thought, but he already looked more relaxed now that he was dressed. 


 


""I can relate to that,"" the redhead commiserated in response. ""I can only hope I'll be forgotten quickly.""


 


***********************


 


Ron couldn't hear anything except Tonks' screams as she was dragged back to the Manor. Some part of him just couldn't accept that they weren't going to be able to free her when she had been so close to them. His logical side, though, knew it was fruitless. 


 


The wolves were howling, frantic and confused with their alpha dead. Ron heard cursing, his people and others, and the sounds of battle being engaged. He and Finian exchanged a glance and took off toward the nearest fight. The Death Eaters looked like they couldn't wait for this fight. That wasn't what he wanted.


 


""Fall back to the woods!"" he called out to his teams. If they were going up against any of the inner circle, it wasn't going to be with them shooting curses from behind impenetrable wards. As he expected, they grumbled angrily, but only sent the lower ranking guards into the woods after them.


 


Ron wasn't terribly worried about fighting them. They were hardly even trained. Near him, Hannah took one down with a well-placed jellylegs jinx and an 

incarcerous

. Angelina stunned another. Ron was grinning at them when Finian suddenly shouted, ""Move, Ron!""


 


It was too late. His wand arm felt like it had been hit by a boulder - completely crushed in and useless. Fin scooped up his wand and put it in his left hand, not that Ron was much good with it there, but better than being defenseless. His friend felled the robed figure before he could cast again, creatively using small slicing hexes to take out the tendons in the back of the legs that allowed him to stand. The man dropped and the two friends turned as they realized the werewolves' howling had become much louder. 


 


They had plenty of people between them and the werewolves, but Ron was still concerned. There were a 

lot

 of them and it sounded like they were regrouping. Cho came running up to him at that moment, the head of one of his teams. 


 


""Ron - I think Greyback's death is why all the wolves are so rabid. We killed two on our way here. Without an alpha, they may get more desperate.""


 


Ron was about to tell everyone to back off and apparate home, that the mission was over, when a werewolf pounced right in front of him. Ron backed away, trying to blast him with his left-handed wand and failing. Cho hit the creature square in the chest with a 

confringo

 but it got right back up and charged Ron again. 


 


Suddenly he stumbled backward over something on the ground - the Death Eater Fin had taken down a few minutes before. Above him, the fight raged on, the werewolf snarling and more vicious by the moment. Michael stepped in front of Ron to block and suddenly the wolf was on top of him. 


 


Ron called out the command for everyone to return home as soon as they safely could. He then rolled away from the fight. He turned back to shoot a spell and help Michael, but he realized that Fin had already stepped in for it. He had to. Michael was laying on the ground with no sign of life in his open eyes. 


 


""No,"" Ron whispered. Why did they have to lose someone else? The whole night suddenly caught up with him and he began shouting at people to get out of there. He was done with this for tonight. They had lost two good people. And his arm needed attention fast. He hoped no one had been bitten, but with their luck, there was bound to be someone. 


 


****************************


 


Tonks couldn't stop screaming. Even when Thorfinn hit her, when he bound her and silenced her, the screams were still coming. Though she couldn't make a sound, her own screams and sobs were all that her brain could acknowledge. Not Remus. Not him. What had he been thinking? Not tonight. Obviously he hadn't been thinking tonight. But why would he let his wolf take over? Why didn't he take wolfsbane this week so he would have known how futile an attack here would be. An attack alone. Who let him loose on a full moon? Was there no one else to stop him?


 


She couldn't catch a breath and for once she honestly didn't know if it was because Rowle was hurting her or if she was simply unable or unwilling to breathe. Where was Teddy? Was he still with her mother? She remembered leaving him there before each mission she went out on. Surely she had before the one she was caught. Why hadn't Remus stayed with their baby? Why had he come here?








 ****************************


 


""Why did it take you so bloody long to get here?"" Travers grabbed Blaise by the front of his shirt as soon as he emerged from the passage. He was glad to have no time to answer as the man drug him along and practically threw him at his friend bleeding on the floor. 


 


Rookwood had claw marks all over his body, from his face down to his ankles, most of them deep, long gouges. On his left shoulder, there was a bite. Blaise wasn't an expert on werewolves, but he knew at a glance that Rookwood would turn next month if he survived this. And if he survived, it was more likely to be from the lycanthropy surging into his veins and strengthening him than Blaise's healing skills. 


 


Still, the young man began chanting spells, looking at the diagnostics and healing what damage he could. He tried to ignore Travers as his continual demands were to get all the werewolf out, ""Don't you let Rookwood here be no stinkin werewolf.""


 


After over an hour of working on him while the Death Eaters swarmed around him, Blaise had the man as stable as he could get him. Rookwood wasn't young, so the change was going to be hard on him, especially considering how difficult the wounds had been to heal. He had scars all over his body. Werewolf claws tended to leave permanent marks.


 


Standing, he turned to Lord Voldemort and said, ""I'm afraid that is as much as I can do for him, my Lord. Perhaps it would be best if Greyback assigns someone to help him come to terms with his new condition.""


 


Blaise was on the ground screaming and thrashing before he had time to realize the 

crucio

s were coming. He wasn't even sure who it came from - who each of them came from, because the spell had hit him from multiple directions at once, throwing his body around like a puppet. The sensation was fire and ice and inside his bones and pummeling through every organ, every muscle. He screamed and screamed and still they did not let up. 


 


He was losing touch with reality when the Dark Lord called, ""Enough. We need our healer competent."" The sensation stopped on the outside, but Blaise still felt pain in every inch of his body and mind.


 


""If he were competent, he wouldn't be coming in here to just say Rookwood's one of them now,"" Travers shouted. There was a murmur of agreement. 


 


Lord Voldemort made a flippant gesture, ""The fool was doomed when he left the wards, just like MacNair. At least this one's alive. I needed a new werewolf to lead anyway, if he's alpha enough.""


 


Travers took a step forward, ""How can you act like his life don't even bloody matter!?""


 


Not a soul in the room dared breathe. Blaise willed his body to still enough to not make further noise. 


 


""The lives of my followers are dear to me. When they choose to no longer follow, however,"" The Dark Lord had stood from his throne and walked toward Travers, ""when they decide to start questioning me, then they are no longer a follower of mine."" 


 


There was suddenly a space around the man as no one wanted to share his penance. Lord Voldemort pointed his wand at Travers, who dropped suddenly to his knees and began begging. Blaise, now part of the crowd, slowly drug his body to his feet and sank back further into the crowd.


 


The Dark Lord listened to his former follower grovel for a few minutes before calling, ""Dolohov!""


 


""Yes, my Lord?"" the man answered eagerly.


 


""A traitor is annoying me. I think your personal talents will best entertain everyone this evening. Do have fun with him.""


 


""It will be my pleasure, my Lord,"" Dolohov replied with elation in his voice, ""If it's to your liking, my Lord, I'll have my wife hold him in place as I work on him."" He yanked Narcissa by the hair and shoved her at the doomed man. She was shaking like a leaf as her hands gingerly went to hold Travers by the arms. Of course Blaise knew he was really being held in place with magic. Narcissa was there for her own torture as Dolohov did Merlin knows what to the man and she would have to stand by.


 


""Healer!"" the Dark Lord suddenly called out. 


 


Blaise scrambled to be seen. ""Yes, my Lord?""


 


""The wretched witch over there - make her stop shrieking,"" Lord Voldemort commanded. 


 


Multiple times he had ordered the 

silencio

 removed from the woman in question only to find that she could not be brought under control. Apparently not even the Dark Lord wanted to listen to the kind of grief-stricken wail Tonks was emitting.


 


""I'll see to her, my Lord,"" Blaise assured him, ""Should I take her to the infirmary?""


 


""Don't waste your time. I'll just drag her up to my room and throw her in a corner,"" Rowle growled at him.


 


""Of course,"" Blaise said with a nod, ""I may send some potions along with you that will shut her up. I'll administer one now, but she won't be able to walk.""


 


""The bitch wouldn't walk anyway,"" Rowle said.


 


Blaise couldn't argue with that, so he said, ""As you say, sir."" Without further conversation, he administered a Dreamless Sleep potion to Tonks and watched as her whole body relaxed. If only he had something that could make things so easy for her heart in the morning. 


 


He was just packing up his bag and preparing to leave when the shrill voice of Bellatrix Lestrange rang through the expansive room, ""Who took him!? Which one of you dare take my pet?""


No trigger warnings, though Bellatrix is a little creepy.

 

Harry Potter isn't mine.


Charlie's search was frantic. He needed a place to hide. A good one. He couldn't go back to Bellatrix. He wouldn't. And he couldn't let his new friends take the fall for it if he was found here. He contemplated heading back into the servant's hall and trying to find somewhere to go, but he was too selfish. He didn't want to cause them trouble, but he knew they were his best chance. 


 


The Malfoy kid - Draco, he reminded himself - was back asleep. Charlie didn't understand exactly what was wrong with him, but it was clear the young man was vulnerable. Draco had collapsed on the bed in Blaise's room after finding these clothes. Charlie had carried him back to his bed in the infirmary. Draco hadn't even stirred. 


 


Clothes. Merlin, it felt amazing to be covered. It wasn't really that he was self conscious. It was just about being in control of it himself. About not being ogled and touched by everyone you passed. 


 


He shuddered, realizing his breathing was picking up. Merlin, he wanted to fall apart for a little while. Not now. He could 

not

 give in to the memories and the panic until he found somewhere safe. Charlie leaned against the doorframe to another room for a moment, concentrating hard on each breath in and out until he was calm again.


 


Looking around, he realized this was the potions lab for the healer. He would need to be careful in this room not to knock anything, but maybe there would be somewhere...


 


He looked in all the cabinets and things. They were too obvious, but he needed to know how things were arranged in case he just had to jump in somewhere. He felt the edges of desperation closing in on himself. 


 


Charlie looked underneath one of the tall cabinets - it sat well off the ground - he could probably wriggle under it if he needed to, but it wouldn't hide him well enough. Beyond it, though, was blackness. It was probably just the wall, wasn't it? But he could see the wall behind the other cabinet like this. 


 


Thinking quickly, he threw open the ingredients cabinet and searched for sparking tinder wings. Thank Merlin Blaise labeled everything meticulously. He reached in for one, slid to the ground, and tossed it under the cabinet. When the wing hit the floor, it sparked as expected and he was able to see beyond. There was a large space of some sort. 


 


Now he just had to get back there. Fast. When he had made it to the infirmary, he had been so relieved that he hadn't worried much. But with every passing minute, Bellatrix had to be searching for him and he was feeling more exposed by the moment. 


 


Charlie slid in between the two cabinets. It was a tight fit, but doable. Unfortunately, he was too big to squeeze behind the cabinet itself. He could see the space now. There would at least be enough room for him to stand - if he was lucky, perhaps it was even bigger. But he had to get back to it first. 


 


He heard the sound of the infirmary door bursting open. Panic shot through him. Charlie knew there was nowhere for him to go quickly enough that he wouldn't be caught. Fear threatened to overwhelm him, but he bit his lip and did the only thing he could think of. He had always been rubbish at wandless magic, but his desperation might cause it to work.  


 


Charlie whispered the disillusionment charm and looked down at himself. Did he look any less substantial? In the dark between the cabinets, he couldn't be sure. All he could do was stand there and wait. He strained his ears to hear who might have come in. 


 


*************************


 


Blaise burst into the long, plain room that was now his infirmary. It had once been a gallery of paintings. He had taken them all down while he was converting it and conveniently hadn't ever gotten around to putting them back up. Blaise had no desire to be watched by the Malfoy ancestors. 


 


He had given an excuse that he urgently needed to get some wolfsbane for Rookwood to take to ensure he didn't change this very night. That wasn't how such things worked, but no one had wanted to argue about it once the possibility was mentioned. Blaise knew he was working with very little time


 


Looking around, he knew things had changed. He could see Draco's curtains, meaning he had been out of bed since Blaise was last here. As he didn't want anyone questioning why he was trying to hide the Malfoy heir, it was nice that the spell was already gone, but what might have happened in his absence worried him. Peeking in the curtain, nothing was amiss. Draco was passed out, though he was on top of the covers. That was unlike his friend.


 


Blaise didn't have time to ponder it. Spinning around, he rushed to the lab and grabbed a Draught of Living Death. He didn't want his patient and friend waking in the middle of the search. He didn't have time to explain what was going on. Merlin, he wished he could ask him about Charlie. Fuck. He hadn't even thought about how Draco might react to a Weasley until after he had sent him along here. 


 


This was still the safest place for him. Blaise just needed to know where the hell he was so he could stop panicking about it. 


 


""Charlie!"" he hissed into the infirmary as he headed back to Draco. Blaise nearly screamed when he felt a tug on his shoulder. He spun and was staring into the man's clear blue eyes. He looked tense, but unharmed.


 


""Didn't mean to scare you. What's going on out there?"" Charlie whispered. 


 


Blaise noticed he was clothed in a lounge outfit an ex of his had once left. He didn't remember keeping it, but he was glad now that he had. Charlie deserved a bit of modesty after the past month. ""Bellatrix is livid, utterly convinced someone stole you. The Dark Lord has demanded whoever has you to bring you forward and be spared. Otherwise, when they find who has you, they plan to murder them slowly.""


 


""Tell me somewhere else to hide and I'll get out of here.""


 


""No way. You're safest here.""


 


""I'll make a run for it. There has to be somewhere else in this fucking palace to hide.""


 


Blaise rolled his eyes. ""You'll get caught. Then they'll check your memories and we're both fucked.""


 


The redhead nodded, though he still looked troubled. ""How soon before they get here?"" 


 


""Just a matter of time. We need to get you hidden. Hell, we need to get you out of this Manor.""


 


""I'm not leaving without Tonks,"" Charlie said stubbornly, his whole countenance changing at the idea of leaving his old friend behind. 


 


""Of course you won't. That would be too simple for a Gryffindor,"" Blaise muttered. ""Now where are we going to put you?""


 


""I have a good spot back here,"" Charlie said, ""but I couldn't get there in time. And I think it might be best if you disillusion me, too. Just in case.""


 


""Show me.""


 


Charlie showed him the niche in the wall behind one of the giant potions cabinets. ""Thank Merlin,"" Blaise breathed. ""I had no idea that was there, but it's perfect.""


 


""Almost perfect. I'm too big to scoot behind it.""


 


Blaise looked at it for a moment, then levitated the cabinet forward a few inches. ""Better?""


 


Charlie tried it and was relieved that he could just barely squeeze behind.


 


""Now get the fuck back there before she gets here. She's not getting you back.""


 


Their eyes met once more and Charlie grabbed his hand and squeezed it before getting in place. When he was in place, Blaise levitated the cabinet back in place and shot a disillusionment spell under the cabinet, then checked that he couldn't see him. He wasn't sure if it was the general darkness or his spell, but he couldn't see Charlie at all. 


 


""You might as well be invisible. Now stay there until I come get you. Please?"" 


 


""I'll wait for you,"" Charlie promised, his voice muffled by the cabinet between them.


 


Now that he was safely hidden, Blaise hustled back to the infirmary and roused Draco to make him swallow the potion down. 


 


""You owe me an explanation,"" Draco said through his drowsiness.


 


""You'll have it, mate, as soon as you wake from this. Now take it, quick,"" Blaise said.


 


He 

evanescoed

 the label away and then went to set the bottle down on his side table. He noticed the table looked fine, but there were several broken potions bottles on top of it. He wondered how much of a mess Charlie had made when he first came in. Draco had clearly met Charlie. He smiled wondering how 

that

 might have gone. If they all made it through this alive, he looked forward to hearing about it.


 


Blaise was just tucking a wollfsbane potion in his bag and preparing to head back down when the infirmary door burst open. 


 


""Are 

you

 hiding my pet, Healer Boy?"" Bellatrix demanded. She was looking around as though he might be standing there somewhere or laying on a bed. ""I remember how eagerly you devoured him with those pretty lips. How you kissed him like you wanted more. I could see it in your eyes, you know. Such lovely dark eyes."" She was walking around him, a finger under his chin so he couldn't look away. ""I think, if we can't find my ginger candy, I might ask our Lord for you. A change of flavor might be in order."" 


 


His eyes had gone wide. Bellatrix genuinely scared him. He knew he was valuable to the Dark Lord as a healer, but you never knew which of Bella's whims he would agree to from moment to moment. 


 


""I don't have him, madam,"" Blaise soothed. ""You are of course welcome to look around. I only have one patient at the moment.""


 


""Oh? Who is that?"" she asked, a predatory smile on her face.


 


He grit his teeth, knowing he couldn't hide his friend's identity. ""Draco Malfoy, madam.""


 


""Draco is here? I had forgotten. Why isn't he healed already?""


 


""He has fallen into a magical coma. He'll come out of it when his body is ready, I presume. I've done all I can do for the prat. Lord Voldemort seems rather pleased with him in this state.""


 


'Hmmm' was all she said in response and went along to his bedside. Blaise rushed to follow her. As much as he feared her, he didn't want her hands on his friend ever again, and certainly not when he had promised to protect him. 


 


She ran a hand down his face, his high cheekbones. ""He's such a pretty boy, such nice Black blood in his veins."" 


 


""Indeed,"" Blaise agreed smoothly. ""Did you want to check the potions lab and my room? Both spaces might offer ample places to hide.""


 


It took her a moment to stop stroking her nephew's face, but Bellatrix eventually spun and asked him to lead the way into his room. Right in front of him, she became a whirlwind of destruction, not just yanking everything out of his closet onto the ground, but pulling out and dumping every drawer in the room, flipping his desk upside down. It was such senseless chaos. It left Blaise shaking, as he was sure it was supposed to.


 


""Madam, if you are satisfied here, may I beg that you search more gently in the potions lab? Some of the potions and ingredients are volatile when mixed, not to mention many of the ingredients being quite expensive. I know our Lord's pockets are generous, but even he would prefer I spend no more than necessary.""


 


""Generous pockets of the Malfoy family, more like,"" she muttered. Blaise found it interesting that she had such strong feelings on the subject, but he just tucked the information away to look at later.


 


Bellatrix curled her lip at him and stormed into the potions lab, but she was far more careful there. She was thorough, but in a controlled way. Blaise could barely hold onto his poker face and breathe as she looked under the cabinet Charlie was hiding behind. The disillusionment held. She saw nothing and moved on.


 


When she had finished, she seemed to have forgotten Draco again. She had practically forgotten Blaise standing right in front of her. She looked worried and angry as she stormed out of the infirmary without another word. 


 


Blaise almost sank to the floor in relief. He needed a solid drink tonight. The problem of what to do with his fugitive weighed heavily on his mind, but he was going to do his best to push that problem until later. For now he needed to rush this potion down to Rookwood and hope no one else had a medical emergency.


 


************************


 


Draco wandered through the garden. He felt an overwhelming need to run, like the maze of roses was trying to close in on him, but he pushed it away. 


 


Well, he tried to. Panic welled up in him as the roses reached out to touch him, to stroke his face. He couldn't stand the feeling and running felt so much safer. 


 


He ran until he reached the fountain. He wished fervently that she were there. His witch. She had been there last time he was in the garden. Today he needed her. Today he wanted to be with her and he didn't give a single fuck about all the reasons he shouldn't want her.


 


Draco sucked in a breath when she suddenly 

was 

there, wandering out of another opening in the roses on the other side. He wasn't sure if she heard him or if she just sensed his presence, but they were suddenly staring at one another with the fountain between them. 


 


Finally, she stepped forward, taking her place on the fountain's edge. ""Well, come on then. Are you going to sit with me again?""


 


He hesitated, then mentally rolled his eyes at himself. He could do what he wanted here. Still, he didn't want to run her off. What if he dreamed her angry and leaving him? ""I...I would like that, but are you sure you're okay with it?""


 


Hermione looked at him, scrunching up her nose in puzzlement. Merlin, he loved it when she did that. ""Why wouldn't I be okay with it?"" she asked.


 


""I've only bullied you the entire time we've known each other,"" he scoffed. He felt the full weight, suddenly, of all the things he had said and done to her over the time they had known each other. He didn't deserve for her to be near him, even in his own head; even if his imagined skin burned with need for her touch.


 


She rolled her eyes at him. ""As if I could forget that. But this... it's not real. And somehow, comforting you comforts me.""


 


Draco stared at her, incredulous at her words. ""I...I know it's not real. There is no way, even in a dream, that you don't hate me.""


 


""Then I have clearly gone mental."" Her foot was tapping with impatience. ""Are you coming over here or not?""


 


""I am,"" he said, letting his feet finally move to her. He didn't deserve her touch, but he had always been selfish and he needed her. He was laying down, his head in her lap and her fingers sifting through the silky strands of his hair before Draco spoke again, his thoughts finally coalescing into something solid.


 


There was something he needed to do. And he could do it right now. He could apologize here, like this. It was much simpler when his mind was controlling how it would play out, when he just knew how genuine he was and he didn't have to prove it to her. Maybe it meant that one day he could apologize to her for real, if he could practice first and pretend that she would accept it. ""I watched you be tortured. Aunt Bella is crazy, and I just stood back and let it happen. I let so much happen. Merlin, Hermione,"" Her name felt strange on his lips. ""I am so sorry for the things that happened to you in my home. All of them.""


 


She stared down at him, her fingers tightened around a couple of locks of his hair, staring through him as though she couldn't even see him there. Then she shook her head and looked into his eyes. ""Thank you. I know it wasn't your fault."" When she saw the look on his face, she cried, ""It wasn't! But it helps to hear an apology from someone. Yes. I think I needed that.""


 


Draco took a deep breath, wondering if it would be silly to tell her about his day, about her boyfriend's brother showing up. He couldn't believe the reaction he had - physical as well as mental - to the idea of the Weasel as her boyfriend. It had just been what he always said to piss them off. Blast them with the truth before they're ready for it. 


 


""You're having a hard time tonight,"" she said, watching him.


 


""Real life is stressful right now,"" he admitted.


 


""A burden shared is a burden halved,"" she told him.


 


His grey eyes stared up into her earnest brown ones and he couldn't stand to tell her about the other things Bellatrix had done and would be happy to do. Hermione had been somewhat protected from her except for the one horrific incident. He was determined to keep it that way. 


 


Letting out the air he had been holding in, Draco noticeably deflated. ""Can we just be here? I just... you calm me down and I need it.""


 


Hermione looked at him and nodded. So that's what they did until she disappeared and he sat and watched the fountain alone, thinking about what it would be like when he returned to the real world. He could dream nonsense all he liked, but he doubted that she would ever really forgive him.


 

I don't believe there are any trigger warnings for this chapter.

Monday, May 25th, 1998; morning


 


Hermione was lost in thought as she quietly ate her breakfast. She had dreamt of Malfoy in that rose garden again. The weirdest thing, she reflected, was that he had seemed so real, so sincere. There were so many people who needed comfort. She wasn't at all surprised that she was dreaming of being there for someone when they needed her. If it had been Harry or Ron or even Ginny, Luna, Neville, George... lots of people would have made sense. But why Malfoy?


 


Her thoughts were interrupted as the floo suddenly sprang to life. She had her wand pointed at it by the time Professor McGonagall stepped out. Bill was in the room, wand out, before she had finished brushing herself off, with Fleur close behind him. The look on Professor McGonagall's face ensured that no one put their wand away.


 


""What's wrong?"" Hermione exclaimed.


 


It took a moment for the woman to gather herself. When the words came, it was clearly painful to say them at all. The entire telling took almost an hour as Professor McGonagall broke down trying to get the story out.


 


Halfway through, Bill had slid to the ground sobbing. Hermione hadn't realized they were close, but Remus had been his mentor through his own wolfish problems, so it made sense. Fleur was trying to calm him, but he seemed inconsolable.


 


Hermione's head was spinning. She hadn't even gotten to see Remus yet. And what about poor Teddy? How was Tonks? Did she know? Hermione was so wrapped in her thoughts, she almost missed the Headmistress preparing to leave.


 


""I must be going. There are others who need to know. I...I have to tell Harry. The last Marauder gone."" The last bit came out in a whisper.


 


""Minerva, wait!"" Hermione cried, throwing herself at the woman for a fierce hug. When she pulled back, she took a deep breath. ""I know this isn't the time, but I was planning to contact you this morning before...this."" She nearly sobbed again. How could Remus be gone when he had so much still to live for? ""I want this war over. I want Hogwarts protected,"" she choked out. ""I need the Hogwarts library, and to see some of the books in the Headmaster's office. Headmistress' office, rather. I have to get those wards figured out now."" 


 


Professor McGonagall nodded. ""I will see what I can do.""


 


""No, Minerva!"" Hermione didn't let her get away. ""No. You can't just brush me off. This is important.""


 


""We don't have the Fidelius in place yet. Severus is nearly there, he thinks, but it may be a week or more before we have it.""


 


Hermione was ready to cry again from sheer frustration. The castle needed more protection now. She needed those books. ""Perhaps Bill could go find what we need?"" she asked hopefully.


 


They both glanced over to the man on the floor. He was practically in a puddle of tears. ""If he is willing,"" Professor McGonagall agreed. 


 


""Or!"" Hermione didn't know why she hadn't thought of this before. ""Maybe he could break the bond! Then I wouldn't have to stay away if I just told Mimsy to stay here at the cottage while I was busy.""


 


McGonagall nodded slowly. ""We will need a few days to make arrangements. Use that time to try this if you think you want to break it and we'll keep working on the Fidelius. Please don't do anything rash, child. My heart can't take much more of this."" With that, the woman stepped back into the floo and was gone.


 


*********************************


 


Every dish in the house was broken. There were piles of broken glass throughout the kitchen except for the moments when his magic would lash out and fling bits of it around or hold some in midair before crashing it again. He was considering going after the furniture next, turning it all into kindling. 


 


Harry hadn't felt anger like this since just after Sirius died. It made sense, really. Remus had been the last of his father's friends. He had been more like an uncle than a father, but Harry loved him just the same. There was nothing he could have done, even if he had been at the castle. Harry knew that. But it somehow still felt like he hadn't done enough. Maybe when he was still there, he could have pushed Ron more to find a way in. 


 


There was no way into that Manor with everyone on guard. Even if they could get in, getting out with prisoners was so unlikely. Not to mention the state they might be in, Tonks and Charlie and any non-Phoenix prisoners they might find. Neville was still in the hospital wing, and his ordeal had been relatively brief. 


 


Dean had tried to calm Harry down at first, but gave up when the plate smashing began. He knew the other boy well enough to know that it was going to be a long while before he calmed down enough to talk reasonably.


 


Theo did 

not

 know Harry well enough to know that. Harry barely noticed as the tall, lanky boy strode up to him, gently pushing a shoulder against him as he walked past. He had to blink a few times before he could focus on what was happening in that very room. Theo was humming mildly to himself and opening various cabinets. 


 


""Did you leave any cups, mate? I was going to make some tea,"" he said nonchalantly.


 


Harry stared at him and then blinked around at the kitchen floor. And table. And counters. Every surface was covered in shattered glass. Theo huffed at him dramatically. With a wave of his wand and a few whispered words, he conjured two teacups from the mess. 


 


""Don't blame me if you take in a few bits of glass while we're drinking,"" he said as he puttered about making the tea. When it was finished, he suggested, ""Perhaps we should take our tea out on the porch."" He led the way and Harry followed in a slightly bewildered state. The whirlwind of dishes swooped up one last time and dropped as he left the room.


 


Theo was silent once they were sitting. Harry didn't know what to make of it and was mostly still wrapped in his own thoughts anyway. It was best not to say anything while his thoughts were this chaotic. 


 


""I'm bored,"" Theo said as he finished his tea. ""Fancy a duel, Potter?"" 


 


""What?"" Harry responded. No one was ever willing to duel him. He wasn't sure if he was that formidable or if people were just afraid they might hurt him, The Chosen One. Either way, he realized that a duel was exactly what he wanted right now. 


 


""A duel. No Unforgivables, nothing we can't heal. Down to the count of 3. Either of us can call it if it's too much.""


 


Harry nodded slowly, and then began to smile. He knew it wasn't his normal smile, but it was confirmed by the quick ripple of fear he saw from Theo before he hid it carefully behind his mask. 


 


The mansion had a reasonable sized garden, including, thankfully, some open space in the middle. There was a proper courtyard right next to the house, of course, that would have worked, but Theo led the way further out to the opening in the garden. Harry found he was glad. It would be better to damage the garden than the house. He expected damage to go flying. He wasn't sure how good Theo was, but he knew what to expect from himself. 


 


They bowed to one another and headed to their respective ends of the garden. As soon as he arrived, Harry spun and shouted, ""

Expulso

!"" aiming it at the ground in front of Theo. 


 


The weedy boy dodged to the side, falling from the impact of the ground exploding to his right, but avoiding being blasted backward himself. Coming out of a roll on the ground, he shouted ""

Mobilicorpus

"" and Harry was suddenly hanging upside down. 


 


Harry mumbled the countercurse, dropped and rolled, only to be hit with 

Impedimenta

 as he tried to get up. His movements slowed and he saw Theo grinning across the field. The other boy said something too quiet for Harry to hear, but he saw the light flying at him. Despite his slow movements, Harry was able to roll enough to avoid it. He had to admit that Theo was good, but he needed to work on not getting too cocky.


 


Theo looked irritated that he had missed, but turned around with a ""

Petrificus Totalus

"" while Harry cast his signature ""

Expelliarmus

."" The spells met, colored light splintering in all directions as the two fizzled out. Harry's surprise was evident enough that Theo took advantage and shouted another ""

Impedimenta

"" since the last had worn off. Harry lurched to the left to avoid it but was hit by the second spell he hadn't even realized Theo sent. A stinging hex made him jump. 


 


With a look of utmost concentration, Harry fired back, ""

Expecto Patronum

."" The silvery light flowed from his wand into a brilliant stag, running straight for Theo. The boy's eyes were huge as he fell back from the stampeding creature. Just before it reached him, he called out, ""I yield!"" The stag swung away from him, running back to Harry and nuzzling him on the chin before disappearing.


 


""What was that thing?"" Theo asked as he walked over to Harry. 


 


""Patronus. Have you never seen one before?"" Harry answered with a smile. He was sweaty and tired, but calm, almost happy in a way. He noticed that Theo seemed the same. 


 


""Maybe once,"" the boy replied. ""It's the spell you used on Malfoy and his gang at the Quidditch game third year, isn't it?""


 


""Yes!"" Harry laughed, ""I had nearly forgotten that."" His good mood suddenly fell again. ""Remus taught me that spell."" 


 


""Can you teach it to me?"" Theo asked as though he hadn't noticed Harry's dark mood swing.



 



Harry was quiet for a moment. He didn't want to teach the other boy anything right now. He wanted to wallow in the guilt and the anger he felt at the world. When he thought about Remus, though, he knew 

he

 would want Harry to teach the other boy. He certainly knew that he could. He had taught so many of the DA to successfully cast one. Curiosity began to take over, wondering what form Theo's patronus might take. 


 


""Yeah, I could teach you,"" he said. 


 


""Maybe you should teach Goyle, too,"" Dean said as he walked up. ""That was a great duel! I think you could both offer some pointers!""


 


Harry was surprised by his friend's enthusiasm. Dean wasn't usually one to get excited easily. ""Is this just to keep me from breaking more dishes? Because if that's...""


 


He was cut off by Theo's laughter. ""What dishes, mate? You already destroyed them all.""


 


Harry glared at him. He was about to say something he would probably regret when Dean put a hand on his shoulder.


 


""Come on, Harry. It'll be like the DA all over again!"" Dean bounced on the balls of his feet with excitement. Goyle looked dubious. Theo tried to seem aloof, but was having trouble not grinning.



 



""Am I not good enough to join the club?"" Theo asked, adding ""You know you want me,"" with a flutter of his eyelashes.


 


Harry barked a laugh, rolled his eyes, and said, ""Fine. But I'm not going easy on you.""


 


******************************


 


""Go again?"" Ron asked, trying to fight back the boredom and frustration.


 


""Do we have to? You know I'm rubbish at wizard's chess,"" Neville complained. The boredom wasn't as upsetting for him. Ron wanted action and plotting and adventure. Neville was content, especially after everything that had happened, to just be where he was comfortable and only show his Gryffindor nature when it was called to duty. It drove Ron mad.


 


Honestly, the hospital wing wasn't even that boring for his fellow patient. Everyone in the castle and some beyond had somehow sent him a plant. Madam Pomfrey didn't usually allow large gifts cluttering her wing, but she seemed to have a blind eye for the jungle now growing around one bed and the young man quietly tending it. She did 

not

 have a blind eye for Ron playing exploding snap to entertain himself. Nor did she have a blind eye for him cursing at Kingsley when the git showed up to complain about the way things had gone so poorly. Ron was utterly done with being in the hospital wing, but he knew she wouldn't let him out until tomorrow morning when his bones had fully regrown and she had observed him resting.


 


When he saw Kingsley and Professor McGonagall enter the wing, he wasn't sure if he wanted to groan at what they could possibly want 

now

 or cheer that their complaints would be a break from the monotony here. He fidgeted as they made their slow way to his bed.


 


""Mr. Weasley. Mr. Longbottom."" Professor McGonagall greeted each of them as though they were still mere students. It made Ron's blood boil. He was supposed to be the General, unless they decided that him taking a group of people to try to save one of their most important officers was grounds for dismissal from the position. 


 


Neville smiled and said, ""Hello Professor, Mr. Shacklebolt. What brings you here?""


 


""We wanted to check on you, of course,"" Kingsley said smoothly, his smile showing his perfect white teeth. 


 


It made Ron want to punch him. ""What are you really doing here?"" he growled. 


 


""That's quite enough of that, Ronald Weasley,"" McGonagall scolded. ""Shall I bring your mother in for this conversation or can you behave yourself?""


 


Ron felt his eyes grow wider, then narrowed them. ""I'll behave as long as you're not yelling at me.""


 


The Professor pursed her lips at him. Kingsley stepped in, ""We have a proposition for you that you will want to hear, Ron.""


 


This had to be something bad. They wouldn't be so solemn if it were about anything good. The two older adults looked at one another nervously when he didn't respond.


 


""Yes, well,"" Kingsley went on, ""you know we've said before that our primary strategist needs to stay in the castle instead of running out on raids and missions.""


 


Ron began glaring harder. ""I'm not staying behind safe walls while I send our people out into danger!"" he yelled passionately.


 


""That's quite enough, young man,"" Professor McGonagall interrupted him. ""Listen.""


 


He sucked in a breath to keep arguing when Kingsley said something that brought the air out of Ron's lungs.


 


""You're wanting to see Hermione, yes?""


 


The redhead stopped the tirade he had planned to launch into and nodded reluctantly. ""Course I do! She's..."" He wanted to say the love of his life, but he knew the older adults would think he was being overdramatic. ""She's my best friend. I love her and I have to see her.""


 


""That can be arranged,"" Kingsley said. ""But we will need assurance from you that you will no longer engage in fighting unless it comes to you.""


 


Ron was quiet for a moment. ""Yes. I'll do it, of course.""


 


""We will require a vow.""


 


""Really?"" Ron asked incredulously. ""You can't put your trust in me, your General?""


 


They both stared at him, McGonagall looking over her glasses at him. Ron flushed red. ""Okay, I'll take the vow."" McGonagall smiled at him and pulled out her wand.











I'm too excited about this chapter to wait a few more hours before posting it. I don't believe there are any major trigger warnings. Fleur's miscarriage and how they are coping is mentioned. 

 

My alpha, omnenomnom, and beta, highlyintelligentblonde, are both wonderful.

 

JK Rowling owns Harry Potter and the associated world and characters. I just like to play with them.


Tuesday, May 26, 1998; morning


 


Hermione didn't understand why Bill fought so hard against trying this. He had warned her it was unlikely to work. Without knowing what kind of bond they were working with, it could be dangerous to break it. However, Hermione was well informed and had made it clear that the risks were worth it for her. 


 


She couldn't afford to send her magic to someone she didn't know, no matter how desperate their need. That's what she kept telling herself. She didn't want her heart to ache at that kind of thought, her body to pulse and call out for someone else's body who she didn't even know. The entire situation of the bond was upsetting to her; it would be a relief to have it gone. Hermione hadn't told Bill how tightly bound she felt, so that he wouldn't use that as an excuse to refuse. 


 


As he moved a chair directly in front of her and sat down, staring into her eyes with his wand drawn, she felt his apprehension and it amplified her own. 


 


""Are you sure about this?"" he asked her quietly.


 


""Yes,"" she replied. She considered giving him, again, all the reasons she wanted to do this, but he already knew. 


 


She watched him take a deep breath, bite his lip, and raise his wand. ""Are you ready then?"" he asked. His voice had hardened somewhat now, resolve steeling his emotions.


 


Hermione nodded and they stared at each other for a few frozen moments. He took a deep breath in and began to chant, moving his wand in a complicated weaving motion. 


 


At first, Hermione felt nothing. A slow, peculiar feeling began in her belly, a feeling like her magic curling protectively into herself. She saw the thread next, tightly stretched away into the distance; it looked dull compared to the shimmering sparkle she sometimes felt from it. This was the first time she could say she truly saw the thread instead of just feeling it. 


 


Again, she found herself wondering who was on the other end, and if they were feeling and seeing this clearly now, too. What if they were in the middle of something? What if they were distracted at a crucial moment? Hermione took a deep breath. This was for Harry, for the Order, for the Wizarding World as it should be. She couldn't worry about the unknown person at the other end of that thread.


 


She felt a pull at her heart as the thread began to tug. She could see Bill's magic surrounding it, pulling gently on it, then a little harder. A web of his magic seemed to sink into the thread. There was the tiniest split as Bill's magic began cutting at the resistant thread. Her heart convulsed, her body following. Hermione was suddenly on the floor, crying and thrashing in pain. She felt like her heart was ripping out of her body, much like a 

Crucio

 but focused strictly on her heart. There was a pang in her abdomen as well, but her body curled around itself as though offering protection to that twinge.


 


Bill was next to her in a flash, his hair whipping wildly in the magic still surging around them. Fleur rushed to their side to help him hold the girl in place so she couldn't hurt herself. Hermione could vaguely hear them yelling her name and Fleur yelling at her husband.


 


Hermione's hands were grasping at her heart. She wasn't sure if she was trying to protect the thread binding her to a stranger or rip it out. She only knew that it hurt with a pain she had never felt before, like her heart was breaking in half and she wanted more than anything to make it whole again.


 


******************************


 


Tuesday, May 26, 1998; At the same time



""You can't stay in this hellhole. There has to be some way to get you out of here now,"" Blaise argued. Draco felt like all he ever heard now was arguing. Their red-headed fugitive was still holding strong against Blaise's insistence that he must make a full escape. 


 


""Well what is it then?"" Charlie fired back. His voice was confident. He knew there was no way out.


 


""Draco can get you through the wards,"" Blaise said. He had never pointed that out before. Draco felt himself stiffen. That was asking a 

lot

 to not have discussed it before presenting it as a possibility. 


 


""Are you trying to get him killed?"" Charlie scoffed.


 


""If you stay, they will find you and kill all three of us,"" Blaise argued back.


 


Even now, Charlie shook his head. ""Then I'll hide somewhere else,"" he said with a shrug, heading for the door. Blaise immediately had a hand on the other man's chest, their eyes locked in a battle Draco didn't understand and was fairly certain he didn't 

want

 to understand. For whatever reason, Blaise desperately wanted Charlie safe. The Gryffindor lion was determined to rescue his old friend before leaving. And somehow Draco felt certain that the man wasn't going to leave Blaise in danger without a fight either. Merlin knew their entire existence here was danger.


 


Draco wasn't sure what to make of it, but he had his own messes to worry about. He felt healed now, physically. It had been slightly less than two weeks. His magical core still wasn't completely recovered, though it had increased tremendously after his rose garden dream while he was under the Draught. He felt helpless without his magic at full strength. He had never known before how much he relied on his magic being at his call anytime he needed it. 


 


Merlin, he hated this bond. As it often did, his mind went to the mudblood on the other end of his magic. There was a longing throughout him to have her next to him. It made him feel sick to his stomach, due to his revulsion that it was her or his desperate need to be near her, he couldn't say.


 


Though he hated the slow healing and how rough the magical overextension was without her near, he knew he owed Hermione his life multiple times over. He wasn't sure if he should thank her for it or not, all things considered. Not that it mattered since he was unlikely to live long enough to see her again. Things were good right now, as long as the Dark Lord didn't figure out that he wasn't really in a coma. Draco shuddered to think what would happen to him if it 

was 

discovered.


 


Blaise urged him to leave before that could happen. They could all three leave, he had said. All four of them now, Draco amended. Five if you counted Charlie's friend. Part of Draco wanted to give in and go. His mother wanted nothing to do with him now, but her feelings toward him didn't change how much danger she was in. If anything, he knew she was in far more danger now than she had ever been with his father alive. He couldn't believe how stupid he had been in that moment, to think that the Dark Lord would allow them to continue their lives without Lucius around.


 


His mind skittered away from the thought of Lucius. Draco couldn't define how he felt about his father's death. He still remembered how much he had adored and looked up to his father. How could he have ever lifted a hand against that man? Then there was the person who had 

Crucio

ed him to toughen him up and threatened his mother when she tried to help him. There was the man who bowed down before that creature and called him Lord. He had bound his family to the Dark Lord and hadn't cared what might happen to them. 

That

 man had needed to die so that his family might escape.


 


Yet, they hadn't escaped. It had all gotten worse. He needed to get his mother out. If he could get her away from Dolohov, surely she would go now. Even if she hated him, she couldn't want to stay with the Death Eaters. He didn't care if she never spoke to him again as long as she was safe. 


 


Draco was jarred from his dreary thoughts by Blaise jostling him in frustration. ""I 

said

, back me up here, Drake.""


 


""With what?"" the blond asked. He was sure he could guess the gist of it, but he hadn't been paying enough attention to know specifics. 


 


Charlie laughed. Draco could not understand how the bloke managed to be so cheerful while his life was in such danger. Bloody crazy Gryffindors. 


 


Blaise grumbled, but couldn't keep his face straight with Charlie laughing. ""I was 

saying

, Draco, that if he's going to insist on staying, we need to find a safer place to hide him.""


 


""Where?"" Draco asked. It was his house and he couldn't really think of anywhere safe. The infirmary was about as good as you could get. ""There's a place he can hide here - that's better than most.""


 


""What happens if they come here when he's not in it?"" Blaise thundered, ""What if they walked in right now?""


 


""Keep bellowing like that and someone will,"" Charlie commented dryly, but he made no move to hide.


 


""Did you have somewhere in mind?"" Draco queried, deflecting the two of them from the glaring contest they were locked in. 


 


Blaise looked defeated, ""Not really. The attics, maybe. If we had Theo here, we could build wards around a room and just hide him in plain sight where no one could get in.""


 


""Well, we don't,"" Draco replied gruffly. He didn't like the reminder that something had happened to Theo. Still, the thought brought an idea to him, ""But maybe you've got something with hiding him in plain sight. We would need to get him a wand. You'd have to be glamoured constantly.""


 


""No way,"" Blaise said, ""One 

Finite

 and he'd be done.""


 


""Polyjuice potion, then, though that will make it harder because he would have to take over as someone.""


 


""Wait - no! You can't turn him into a Death Eater!"" Blaise spluttered, catching on to Draco's plan. 


 


""Not an important one,"" Draco agreed, ""but a guard, someone who doesn't get any real action.""


 


Blaise looked incensed. ""Absolutely not. He-""


 


""Can speak for himself, Blaise,"" Charlie interrupted. ""I can't get Tonks out while I'm trapped up here hiding. Tell me more about how this could work.""


 


Draco took a deep breath. It really was a mad idea. He wondered if the bond to Hermione was somehow turning his brain Gryffindor. ""For a glamour we would just sneak you in with the new recruits. If we have to use polyjuice, we would need to observe and find a loner, someone nobody else would notice acting differently.""


 


""What would we do with the person he was polyjuicing into?"" Blaise asked.


 


Draco faltered. He wasn't sure how they would make that work. They wouldn't want to just kill them, but how would they keep them? Oh! ""Draught of Living Death like you've been doing for me and a glamour on him. No one is going to use 

Finite

 in the infirmary.""


 


Charlie was nodding. ""I think it will work.""


 


""No!"" Blaise argued heatedly. ""I'm not letting you kill yourself.""


 


""With your help, this isn't a death sentence,"" Charlie coaxed. His large, rough hands were gripping Blaise, one at his shoulder, the other on his hip. The effect was intimate even with Draco staring at them. He stood to excuse himself. They didn't need him here for this part of the 'discussion.'


 


He had taken three steps toward the door when he gasped. The thread that connected his magic to Hermione's was suddenly vivid in his eyes. He could see it stretching thin from deep inside himself out of the room and far beyond. There was no sparkle to it. It looked and felt dull, somehow off from the way it should be. For a split second, he saw a burst of magic shooting along it, then he fell, writhing, to the floor. Draco heard screaming but couldn't connect it with the instant pain in his own throat. 


 


He vaguely heard Blaise tell someone to go hide and then felt his friend beside him. He was lifted into the air, cushioned by the wind of the spell as it moved him back to the bed. Even so, he couldn't stop his limbs from convulsing or his hand from grasping at his chest. He was screaming from the intensity of the pain. 


 


As suddenly as it had come, the attack stopped. His body still flailed on the bed, Blaise barely able to hold him down. His screams dropped to whimpers and crying. The door to the infirmary burst open and the Lestrange brothers rushed in with three lesser guards behind them. 


 


""What's this?"" Rodolphus sneered.


 


""Is the brat finally awake?"" Rabastan asked, a menacing grin on his face. 


 


Draco was still shaking uncontrollably and crying out. His heart felt like someone had tried to rip it literally in half. He couldn't see through the pain. He heard Blaise speaking in that low, rolling healer voice he had perfected. Draco wasn't sure if it was supposed to be soothing him or getting his uncles to back off. He felt a potion bottle at his lips and, as he drank, everything went blissfully black.


 


********************************************


 


Bill felt terrible as Fleur fussed over the girl. Hermione was another little sister as far as he was concerned; he should never have agreed to break that bond. Try to break it, that is. He could only imagine how much damage it would do to actually break it, if he even could. The tiny split he had made was patching itself before he even pulled away, though he suspected the bond would hurt for some time, especially with the two separated. He wished he knew what 

kind

 of bonding it had been.


 


Hermione was on the couch now, looking stunned and in pain. One hand was at her heart, making sense based on the location of the bond, but the other was wrapped protectively around her middle. She had thrown up a few minutes ago and Fleur had been shooting him even angrier looks since then. 


 


""Beel, go make ze girl some tea. The mint 'er 'ouse elf makes,'' his wife commanded. He didn't even think about arguing. It took only a moment with his wand to have a cup prepared. He wondered where Mimsy was, now that he was thinking about her. It was unlike the bossy little elf to not be in the middle of things. Then he remembered the sly look on Hermione's face that morning as she suggested Mimsy go shopping for a big meal she simply 

had

 to have. She had known well enough not to try breaking the bond with the elf around, he suspected. Mimsy still got quite defensive about her former Master, whoever he was.


 


As he walked back into the room, he saw that his wife was running healing diagnostics over Hermione. Whatever she was finding made her look very worried. Healing wasn't his specialty, but Bill took a peek up at the runes and numbers floating above the girl. His jaw dropped. Merlin, had he known...


 


Fleur looked up at him like she might murder him on the spot. He handed her the tea with a shaking hand. Pregnant. Hermione was 

pregnant

 and he had just tried to break a bond that could have rebound and killed her. At the very least, she now had this pain in her body. What if it compromised the pregnancy? 


 


Then his thoughts turned darker, to how she had gotten pregnant in the first place. She clearly didn't know about it yet, though he knew Fleur was moments from breaking the news. She had been on the run with two teenage boys for months, at least one of whom was head over heels in love with her. The baby 

could

 be Ron or Harry's. Bill had a feeling, though, that it was nothing as simple as that. Harry was back to dating Ginny, quite enthusiastically. Ron had been pining for Hermione, but in a way that still hovered between the deep love of friendship and a lovesick puppy. Bill didn't think they were lovers.


 


He heard the teacup shatter and a desperate, ""No!"" Looking at the scene, Hermione was sobbing in Fleur's arms, while Fleur cried with her. His wife still hadn't recovered from losing their baby. He hadn't either. And she seemed to think he blamed her for losing it. Nothing he said convinced her otherwise. Seeing another young mother had to be hard for her.


 


Before he could make a move towards the two women, a pop sounded in the room. Mimsy had returned from her shopping. They were all going to be in trouble now. The little elf had barely entered the cottage before she was rushing into the room, distressed. 


 


""Mistress Hermione! Whats is wrong!?"" Before the girl could answer, Mimsy spun to Bill, pinning Fleur with her eyes as well, ""Whats yous do to Mimsy's Mistress?""


 


Bill had only seen such a fierce looking house elf during the battle at Hogwarts. This little one looked like she was ready to go to war. 


 


""Mimsy, don't. It's not their fault,"" Hermione managed to say between sobs. A wrinkly old hand touched her shoulder. 


 


""Tell old Mimsy whats wrongs then, Mistress.""


 


Bill realized he had also never witnessed such gentle tending from a house elf. Mimsy was very dedicated to her family. Her 

family

. The elf, and whoever her mysterious Master had been, likely knew about the pregnancy, or at least the possibility of it. He almost gasped aloud with that understanding. 


 


Hermione sniffled, ""I'm pregnant. And I don't...I have no idea...I've never even had sex."" She ended her statement on a wail. 


 


Bill and Fleur's eyes met across the room. The poor girl, they were both thinking. It had to have happened between the battle and her escape with Mimsy. Rape, undoubtedly, and just as assuredly by a Death Eater. 


 


Mimsy patted her hand. ""Mistress has many months to get used to the New Master.""


 


""New Master?"" Hermione queried through her tears. Then something in her expression told Bill it had clicked with her, too. She was too smart for her own good sometimes. ""You knew,"" she whispered. ""You've known all along I was pregnant. It's your Master's isn't it? Zabini's? Is that who the father is?""


 


Mimsy cowered a bit under her Mistress' anger, ""No, its not be Mister Blaise. Hims be a good boy. Master was bad, but hims did not wants to be. Mimsy knows.""


 


""Well, I 

don't 

know, Mimsy!"" Hermione yelled, nearing hysterics. ""I don't know that your Master is a decent person. I don't know who Master is, but I have a feeling he's at the other end of this accursed bond and I want him gone."" She turned to Bill with a manic look in her eyes. ""Get that thread out of me, Bill. I don't care how much it hurts me, I want it gone.""


 


The elf's eyes were suddenly enormous and her whole demeanour changed. ""No, Mistress. Yous be hurting yous self and yous baby. Mimsy nots lets you gets hurt."" Turning to Bill, she said, ""Yous stay away from the Mistress. That bond can'ts be undone.""


 


""You know about the bond."" Hermione spoke in a hushed but angry tone. Bill could see all the conflicting emotions vibrating through her like she might explode at any moment. 


 


Setting a hand on the girl's shoulder to steady her, Bill said to the elf, ""What can you tell us about the bond?"" 


 


Mimsy shuffled. ""I is not being there when it happened. But I getteds Mistress a book from the library abouts them. She has it in hers beaded bag.""


 


Bill exchanged a look with his wife. He suspected Mimsy knew more about it than she was saying, but Hermione had clearly latched on to the idea of the book and practically forgotten the rest of them existed. 


 


She commanded Mimsy to bring her the bag. When she had it, she muttered, ""

Accio

 bond book,"" and had it in hand within a moment. She pulled out an ancient looking book. The title was emblazoned on the cover in gold, 

Marriage Bonding Rituals, Rites, and Wrongs

. Hermione almost dropped it. She looked up at Mimsy, ""A marriage bond?"" she whispered. ""I'm MARRIED?"" Her voice was growing shrill. 


 


Merlin. He had tried to break a marriage bond strong enough that they could pull magic from each other. If he had succeeded, there was no doubt in Bill's mind that it would have killed her.


 


Hermione stood up off the couch. ""I won't have Bill do anything tonight. Nothing until I've read this book. But you..."" she took a couple of deep breaths to calm herself, ""Bill, do you think you could show Mimsy to the Burrow?"" She didn't wait for him to answer before turning back to the elf. ""Mimsy, this is a direct order - you will go to a wizarding house called the Burrow. The Mistress there is Molly Weasley, though she may not be home right now. You will treat her as you treat me. You will not talk to Master or any of Master's friends, you must be loyal only to the Weasley family and myself. And Harry Potter. Tell Molly I have sent you to work for her until I am in need of you.""


 


The little elf began to cry. ""You do needs Mimsy now,"" she cried. 


 


Hermione held fast. ""I need help from those who are here for me, not for their old Master or a new Master that we're waiting on for the next few months. Get out of my sight. I can't believe I trusted you!""


 


Bill put his hand on the elf's arm and popped away with her, his last view Hermione collapsing in a sobbing heap and Fleur pulling her into her arms.


 


*************************************


 


Severus smiled as he looked over at Minerva. They had been working on the spell for days, but they had it now. She looked impossibly tired. He 

felt

 impossibly tired. It would take a couple of days to prepare everything, and they still had to select the Secret Keeper, but soon Hogwarts would be safe again. 


 


There had been several small skirmishes at the edge of the wards in the last few days. They seemed to be figuring out the weak points. Severus knew they needed to cast the Fidelius as immediately as possible. He only hoped that it would be enough, that it would adequately erase everyone's memories of where the ancient castle had been.







No trigger warnings on this one.

 

I don't own Harry Potter.


Hermione was walking through the woods, her mind whirling. She was a strong witch, magically and personally. But how was she supposed to cope with this? How could she be married to someone and not even know who? How could she carry a child without any clue who its father might be? What if they weren't even the same person - her husband and the father of her child? There was no assurance that they were, not with the Death Eaters. Anything could have happened in the days she didn't remember.


 


She missed the soft security of Fleur's arms around her, the protective big brother feeling of Bill picking her up and tucking her into bed. They couldn't fix the situation or understand quite how she was feeling, but they offered her comfort she badly needed.


 


Now she was alone, pushing branches out of her way and trying not to trip on the uneven ground. Hermione wasn't sure how long she had been walking, letting her thoughts chase around in circles. It felt like moments and days at once. She noticed it was starting to get dark and felt a sudden need to go home. Where was home? 


 


What was home? Was it Hogwarts? Shell Cottage? How did she get to these woods? Hermione was suddenly struck by an intense feeling of unease. She wasn't sure where she was or where she was supposed to be or even how she had gotten to this place. In the distance, she heard what sounded like a howl. That was disturbing. The last time she had heard a howl like that, she had been in the Forbidden Forest. Was that where she was?


 


The howl sounded again, but closer this time. Much closer. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up. Hermione felt the overwhelming need to run sweep over her. Turning, she began retracing her steps quickly. Wherever she had entered the woods from, she should return. That would be home, wouldn't it? Shell Cottage, she thought. Her mind was hazy on the subject, too many other things crowding out that information.


 


There was a sound behind her. Running. And the howl again, nearby. Hermione wanted to scream, but held it in, her feet moving ever faster. The trees and bushes held her back, scratching her and tearing at her clothes as she ran, the sound of the wolf behind her getting steadily closer. 


 


She was breathing hard. Her legs were on fire, as well as the skin of her cheeks and arms where they had been scratched. She could hear the wolf gaining on her, just behind her. She felt its hot breath on the back of her neck. 


 


With a scream, she slammed into something hard, sending herself and the solid mass sprawling. When she looked up, they were in a clearing, no sign of the wolf behind her. Across the ground was a sneering, pointed face beneath silver-blond hair. 


 


""What the fuck did you do?"" Malfoy demanded.


 


""It would be you, wouldn't it?"" she said, half to herself as she shook her head, finally realizing she was back in the dream world again.


 


""Of course it's me,"" he snarled. ""Who else would hate themselves enough to be here with you, Mudblood?""


 


Hermione closed her eyes, willing herself to wake and be done with this. Her brain's issues with Malfoy were the last thing she needed to be dealing with tonight. ""As if I would believe that the great Draco Malfoy hates himself,"" she huffed.


 


""I've done unspeakable things. You don't know the half of it."" 


 


""I'm sure I don't,"" Hermione grumbled to herself and wondered if there was a spell that would at least let her control her dreams. She hardly needed a guilt trip right now. 


 


""But even I don't deserve this.""


 


""And I do?"" she demanded. 


 


""Merlin Granger. You're so annoying!""


 


""Yeah well I'm pretty sure I'm having a nightmare since you're here, Malfoy."" 


 


Why, out of all the Death Eaters, did he have to be the stand-in for her bondmate? Sure, she didn't 

know

 many Death Eaters so otherwise it would be... Goyle, Crabbe, or his father. She scowled. Maybe Malfoy was the better option. At least he wasn't half bad to look at.


 


""Well?"" Malfoy snapped.


 


""Well what?"" Hermione couldn't understand what he was trying to demand from her. Why should she answer to him anyway? ""I don't want the fucking bond. I don't want to be married. I'm too young for all of this!"" she screamed at him. Of course 

Malfoy

 wasn't at fault for the things happening to her, but why not yell at him anyway? He was here and she was angry. So incredibly angry. 


 


""Of course you are. We're all just fucking children, but here we are,"" Malfoy spat out. His face twisted as though he were in pain. 


 


Her breath caught on a sob. ""Don't talk to me about children. It's not 

fair

,"" she whimpered, dissolving into tears. She would never bother to say it in the real world, but she could wallow in her grief here. 


 


They were both silent for long moments as she sobbed. Malfoy moved toward her a couple of times, but then pulled himself back. ""Why is it you?"" she finally managed. ""I guess... I don't remember well enough..."" Truly, she could barely envision Blaise, much less any of the other Slytherin boys like Nott or Flint. She supposed she was glad it was Draco's face her subconscious had given to the nameless Death Eater. At least he was familiar, and less awful than his father. What a pathetically low bar to be grateful for.


 


""Thank Merlin you don't have to remember,"" Malfoy said quietly. ""So... are you not going to tell me what you did?""


 


""What I did about what? I don't bloody know what I did. I can't remember.""


 


He rolled his eyes. ""What did you do to the bond, you daft bint?""


 


Hermione bit her lip. So this was what she was worrying over. Of all the things for her mind to focus on right now. ""I need to get rid of it.""


 


""And you actually tried?"" Malfoy stared at her incredulously.


 


""Don't you lecture me! I had no way of knowing and I can't be throwing my magic to some Death Eater when I need it myself. I have to help Harry and the Order,"" she defended.


 


""So you're trying to kill yourself instead of be bonded to me? You think you'll be more useful to them dead?"" His voice was rising as he went. ""You didn't think you might hurt me?""


 


""You aren't my responsibility! You're just some Death Eater who... who... married me for some awful reason!"" she cried. ""I don't even know who 

you

 really are!""


 


""Well it's not like we were ever given the chance to chat over tea and scones, were we?"" For a brief moment, a trace of sadness crossed Malfoy's face before the anger and frustration twisted it again. ""But it doesn't matter whether you really know me or not. I didn't think you would be so callous with anyone's life.""


 


""I can't... I just can't... Don't you think I have enough to take care of?""


 


""You're the bloody bleeding heart of Gryffindor. You care about everything! Why 

not

 me!?!"" he roared.


 


""I will care about the ones who deserve my love and protection. I'm done with you, Malfoy - whoever you really are. You're not welcome to come back here."" She waved her hand and he melted away, leaving her alone in the clearing. 









She woke to Fleur shaking her. """"Ave some water. You were screaming and then talking een your sleep. We couldn't wake you.""


 


Hermione gratefully drank. ""I'm sorry I woke you. Or kept you up.""


 


""Eet eez okay, 'Ermione. You 'ave 'ad a big shock."" Fleur looked behind her to Bill. He had his hands on her shoulders and was nodding along with her statement.


 


""I wish we could make this easier,"" he said, sighing. ""You've been through too much already."" Hermione could tell he was genuine in that feeling. 


 


""I just wish I knew who it is... on the other end of the bond. And if that person is my... my baby's father. I... Fleur, are you sure that no one who was with you remembers anything?"" She asked the question quietly. She knew she really shouldn't. Fleur had a very hard time with anything related to her time as a prisoner.


 


Bill shot her an angry look, the first he had ever given her. Before he could say anything, however, Fleur cleared her throat. ""I do not theenk you will 'ave any luck, but you could ask them when you are at 'Ogwarts. We were all obliviated like you.""


 


""But maybe someone overheard something, or they missed some memories,"" Hermione said, desperately hoping it might be true. Fleur nodded and pet her hair. ""Maybe it will just be a few more days until they figure out the Fidelius,"" Hermione mumbled, yawning.


 


Bill looked down at her, his eyes softer again now. ""I'm sure it will be done soon. Try to sleep, Hermione. We'll be near if you need us, but you need to rest.""








****************************








Leaning against a stone wall was not conducive to sleep, especially when he had gotten used to a fluffy bed. Charlie would rather be here trying to sleep standing up than in that bed, but it still made things difficult compared to his dragon keeping days. It hadn't really been that long, but it felt like a lifetime ago that he last saw the open sky of the Reserve and his beloved dragons. He wasn't sure he would ever make his way back to that life, so aside from hiding, perhaps he wouldn't need the skill of sleeping literally anywhere. 


 


Then again, it might be a very necessary thing to re-learn if he was going to be a soldier of evil. Charlie chuckled darkly to himself. He had a variety of reasons to follow Draco's plan. He needed to be out of here and 

doing

 something, first and foremost. He also needed a way to break Tonks free and no matter where his guard persona was stationed, he would have better chances than hiding would ever give him. He had one more thing he needed to do, though he wouldn't admit it to the others. He was going to make sure Bellatrix would never be able to hurt another soul, even if it meant staying past getting Tonks out.


 


""Charlie..."" he heard a low whisper, Blaise obviously trying to get his attention, but without waking him if he had managed to fall asleep. 


 


He grunted in reply and began shifting the cabinet with his magic. Blaise had come through for him - again - and provided a wand. It wasn't a great match, but it grudgingly worked for him. The man waited patiently for Charlie to get out in the open. 


 


""Have you been able to sleep?"" the Healer asked, worry obvious in his tone.


 


""No,"" Charlie admitted, ""but I'll be fine.""


 


Blaise pursed his lips and Charlie couldn't help but think they looked kissable that way. ""You're going to make yourself sick if you don't get some sleep.""


 


""What do you suggest, good Healer?"" Charlie asked with a false smile. He couldn't imagine any solution beyond his exhaustion finally taking over.


 


""You're going to sleep in my bed for a while. I'll stay out in the infirmary on guard. Draco should be waking up again sometime soon anyway and I'll need to check over him.""


 


It all sounded very logical. They were both worried about Draco and Blaise had only been able to give him a Dreamless Sleep in front of his Uncles rather than the Draught of Living Death. He had told Rabastan and Rodolphus that Draco woke that way sometimes, but would only scream and convulse until given a potion to go back down. It was unlikely to be a sign that the coma was over yet. After some grumbling, they told Blaise that next time they wanted to watch him flop around until he hurt himself for a while, but otherwise they seemed satisfied with the story. 


 


""Blaise... I can't ask you to give up your bed and your own sleep for me,"" Charlie said. His hand reached out automatically to run down Blaise's arm as he stared into the deep brown eyes of the other man. Fuck. He hadn't meant to do that. And there was the final reason he needed to get out of hiding.


 


He kept manipulating Blaise. It was like breathing now - using his body to get what he wanted, needed. It was wrong, so wrong, especially when it was so easy with him. Charlie knew how attracted the young Healer was to him. Blaise had admitted as much the day he apologized for what Bellatrix had made him do. He had taken all the responsibility for what happened, even though it had been forced on both of them. How much either of them were attracted really hadn't mattered. 


 


But now it did. The tension between them was unbearable sometimes, and his own behavior wasn't helping. Charlie just couldn't seem to make himself stop.


 


After a small back and forth, he allowed Blaise to win and headed for the bedroom, collapsing gratefully into the soft bed. He inhaled and nearly choked on his own rising desire. Fuck. Charlie wasn't sure he could sleep with the other man's scent all around him. 


 


The memories seared through his brain, replaying for the thousandth time - the feel of Blaise's lips on his cock, his tongue flicking around it, slim hands touching his hips and chest. The deep connection he felt every time their eyes met, the electric pull between them. And then the kiss. Oh Merlin he wanted to kiss him again. 


 


He screwed his eyes shut and fought the wave of panic that followed his desire. Yes, he wanted Blaise, but the thought of sex, of even being touched, also terrified Charlie. Maybe someday... but how could it be with him when they had met the way they had? There was something very fucking wrong with him that he still felt that connection, still wanted Blaise the way he did.


 


It didn't help any that the younger man was so fucking noble. For all that Blaise sometimes looked at him with longing, he never laid a finger on him unless he was checking the mostly healed wound on his neck. But it was more than that. He also knew from Draco about all the people Blaise was tending when he wasn't supposed to be. Of course he had known from his own experience that the Healer tended to do more than was approved, but knowing the extent he went to for some of them, and the danger he was in if he was caught... Charlie was impressed, and far more emotionally moved than he wanted to be.


 


He tried to relax and think about literally anything else. Sleep was precious and there wasn't much time before he would have to give up the bed. But his mind wouldn't stop focusing on Blaise, and his body was demanding release. With a groan he gave in, moving his hand down into his pants and letting the memories and his own dark fantasies wash over him as he pleasured himself. 


 


It took almost no time - his body was ready so fast now, and so desperate to get off before anyone could make him stop. He grabbed his wand and cleaned up, trying to fight down the wave of shame and self-hatred. Still, with his body sated, Charlie wrapped himself in the blankets that smelled like Blaise and imagined it was the man himself holding him safe as he fell into an exhausted slumber.








********************************








They had made scones this time. They weren't strictly necessary, but Ginny had felt they would need an influx of energy and something to help their magic stabilize when the spell was complete, so she had gone to him for help.


 


""We could just use Pepper Up,"" he drawled with a raised eyebrow.


 


Ginny rolled her eyes at him. ""Scones taste better.""


 


He didn't argue with her and instead gathered a few ingredients from his cabinets before following her to the kitchens. Salamander Blood to get the blood stirring. Fire seeds to bring back the spark of energy. Mandrake Root for fluidity. Powdered bicorn horn to appeal to the duality of forces. Dragon scale flecks for balance. 6 dandelion heads for grounding. A tabletop mushroom, sliced, for stability.


 


Ginny had added blueberries and cranberries for everyone's enjoyment. And love. She added love to everything.


 


They were both pleased with how they turned out, though Snape would never admit it. He stood next to her with his arms crossed, watching as the various casters took their places. Ginny could tell he was irritated that he couldn't be among them, but no one trusted him that much. 


 


Only enough to help create the spell himself. Internally, she shook her head at the thought. As far as she was concerned, he had proved himself multiple times over.


 


Headmistress McGonagall would be the focal point of the spell, but there was someone casting as well from each direction - Professor Sprout to the North, the auror Dawlish to the East, Kingsley to the South, and Andromeda Tonks to the West. Somewhere in the watching crowd, the Secret Keeper was present. Part of the reason a crowd was even allowed was to cover up who it might be. 


 


Ginny wasn't exactly sure how that worked, but Snape was adamant that it was the only way to ensure secrecy with this many people in the castle. There had been a small ritual earlier to prepare the Secret Keeper as a receptacle so that only they would receive the magic. 


 


The people inside the castle would not be able to find it again if they stepped outside of the grounds. Yes, a great many of them would learn the secret so that they could go out on raids and other missions, but Snape assured her that the Keeper would be kept very safe inside the castle. 


 


Ginny watched in awe as McGonagall finished her chanting and the witches and wizards at the cardinal points each chanted back to her. As they pointed their wands up and toward the center, magic crackled through the air above them all until a giant dome encased the entirety of their little world here. 


 


""It's putting Hogwarts in a bubble,"" she said without meaning to. 


 


Snape nodded, his own eyes wide with the wonder of such a large spell. ""10 points to Gryffindor,"" he said absentmindedly. ""It extends just like this under the ground as well, so that we are protected even if they tried to tunnel in or find the pipes in the Great Lake.""


 


Ginny let out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding. She had been to the Chamber. She knew how deep down Hogwarts went and it could have been a vulnerability. Of course Snape and McGonagall were too smart to leave it unprotected. 


 


For the first time since the Battle itself, she felt like they were truly safe. It would be even better when the walls were rebuilt and properly warded, but now they had the time and security to figure it out. And with Hermione back, she was confident it was only a matter of time. 









There are no trigger warnings for this chapter.

I *will* warn you that Ron does some backsliding here. He'll get better eventually - I'm not going full Ron bashing or anything, I promise. 

 

As always, I do not own Harry Potter.


Wednesday, May 27, 1998; wee hours of the morning


 


Draco woke with a start, feeling like he had been flung from his sleep. It was stupid, but he blamed his dream. 

She

 had thrown him out. How fucking pathetic do you have to be to get kicked out of your own dreams by your subconscious? He hadn't been this angry in weeks. He breathed in and out slowly, trying to calm himself. It was just a dream. Being angry with her wasn't logical.


 


Except that something actually had happened to the bond. Clearly, his subconscious was providing the obvious solution. 


 


She would have tried to break it. Of course she would. He knew Granger was the sort of fiercely independent witch that would try something stupid like that. Did she hate him that much? 


 



Probably, but she didn't know it was me

, he reminded himself. Could it be as simple as dream-Hermione had said? It was probably that she needed to not be drained, especially if it took her as long to recover as it took him. That was the logical answer. But 

surely

 she was smart enough to know she would hurt the other person and she was just soft-hearted enough to care... Except that she didn't. And didn't that sting like a bitch?


 


He blinked at the thought, but no, it was actually true.


 


He wanted her to care. Draco realized that part of his anger was to cover how fucking 

hurt

 he was that she didn't. It was sick. Why did he care what she thought? She didn't matter. She was just a mudblood. A vile, pathetic, poorly behaved mudblood... His mudblood. 

His

. He may not 

want

 Granger, but she undeniably belonged to him. She was his fucking wife. Merlin, he needed her here, wanted her to be here. His chest was caving in, crushed by the weight of her missing presence. He was desperate enough to have her invading his dreams. What would he do if she was 

actually 

here? How did he let it get this far?


 


Draco was perilously close to panicking. He was gasping for breath when the curtain was drawn back.


 


""Take this,"" Blaise said, his voice rolling in a way that let Draco know he was his Healer right now. Without even glancing at the vial, he drank it down. Calming Draught. He was entirely too familiar with its taste and texture. ""These too,"" Blaise said, handing several more potions over.


 


Draco looked at them. The last was more Draught of Living Death. Fuck - he didn't want it again. He stared into his friend's eyes, an unspoken plea passing between them. 


 


Blaise sighed. ""Drake, if your Uncles come back in here and catch you, you're dead. We're both dead. I need you to be unconscious for a while.""


 


""I hate this."" Draco's voice was barely more than a whisper and he hated how much like a child he sounded. He fucking hated his life right now. Something about the cut to the bond and then that dream to follow had made him feel very not-fucking-okay. Laying there all the time with nothing to do except worry and wait was making him crazy. 


 


All he wanted in the world was Hermione's arms around him. And a way out, but if Hermione were here, she would find one. She hadn't come up with anything when she was here before, but the circumstances were different now and they had time to think of something. But she 

wasn't 

here. And thank fuck for that. For better or worse, he was on his own. Draco took a deep breath in. He had to think of something. He and Blaise would die if they stayed here. 


 


""What happened? Do you know why you collapsed?"" Blaise asked, his voice soft.


 


Draco ran a hand down his face. ""Sort of. Something happened to the bond. Like someone was trying to cut it.""


 


Wide eyes stared back at him. ""I figured it was the bond,"" Blaise said, ""But I never imagined she would try to destroy it.""


 


""I... could only guess why,"" Draco said, his voice bitter. ""I assume she would think that she couldn't afford to send her magic and energy to some Death Eater all the time when fucking Potter and the Order need her.""


 


Blaise nodded as he watched Draco taking pain and nutrition potions. The scrutiny bothered Draco, but there was no escaping it.


 


""Mate,"" Blaise started. ""Are you okay?""


 


""Fine.""


 


""It's okay to feel like shit over this,"" Blaise said. ""It's old magic. I'm surprised you've beat off the compulsions this long.""


 


Draco felt sick at that thought. He couldn't speak, and wouldn't have if he could. He was not going to be fucking 

compelled

 to be with Hermi... the mudblood. He was stronger than this. 


 


""Drake..."" Blaise interrupted his thoughts. 


 


""I'm fine."" Draco hissed, but his voice was less than convincing, his usual control slipping in his exhaustion.


 


Blaise stared at him, waiting. Draco bit his lip until he tasted blood. He was not going to break down no matter how long that tosser fucking waited. But then a tear slipped out. And another. Fuck. 


 


""Just... why would she try to break it, Blaise? She had to know it would hurt me. Does she really hate me that much?"" Draco barely held his voice steady, the urge to wail or at least whimper nearly overwhelming him. 


 


""She has every reason to hate you,"" Blaise pointed out. ""And even more reason to hate being tied to someone when she doesn't know who it is. For all she knows it could be Dolohov or Voldemort himself.""


 


Draco shuddered. He knew there were good reasons for her not to want the bond. But the rejection he felt was like a knife stabbing into his heart and rooting around. 


 


""You miss her,"" Blaise said, still watching him. 


 


""More than anything,"" he whispered, feeling like the words were being dragged from him. ""And it's only getting worse every day."" 


 


Draco wanted to punch something. He had to stop talking about this. It wasn't helping and he was going to completely fall apart if he didn't distract himself somehow. ""What are you doing up, anyway?"" 


 


""I was waiting for you,"" Blaise explained. ""And letting Char sleep for a little while.""


 


""In a bed?"" Draco blinked. ""Your bed?"" When Blaise nodded without making eye contact, Draco let out a low whistle. ""You've got it bad.""


 


Blaise glared at him. ""He needs to rest and I needed to be here when you woke up. It made sense.""


 


""What are you going to do if they catch him?""


 


""They're all at tonight's entertainment right now,"" Blaise countered.


 


""I didn't just mean tonight,"" Draco said, watching his friend avoid answering. ""You have feelings for him, don't you?""


 


""Doesn't matter,"" Blaise responded dully. ""He's been through enough shite and I'm not adding to it. I would never want him doing something because he thinks he has to in exchange for my help. He doesn't deserve that.""


 


""Does he deserve to have his feelings returned?""


 


The only answer was a snort and Draco knew he would get no further on the subject tonight. ""The entertainment is pretty late, isn't it?""


 


Blaise nodded, but wouldn't meet his eyes. ""Who is it?"" he asked with a sudden sense of foreboding. It only got worse when Blaise still wouldn't look at him. He felt his heart hammering. ""It's my mother, isn't it?"" he finally asked. 


 


""And your Aunt,"" Blaise answered lowly. ""Bellatrix is finally being punished for losing Charlie. Dolohov suggested his wife might be to blame, too.""


 


Draco started to maneuver himself from the bed. 


 


""Not a chance,"" Blaise said, pushing him back down. It was lucky for that arsehole that Draco was still so weak. Draco struggled, but there was really nothing he could do. He was straining against his friend and trying to curse him when Blaise finally got the Draught of Living Death tipped down his throat. Draco was out again almost instantly.








*************************************








Friday, May 29, 1998; morning


 


Hermione was both excited and nervous as she stepped into the floo and headed to Hogwarts. She couldn't wait to be back in the castle. She couldn't wait to further her research or to just be back in a place she considered home. Most of all, she couldn't wait to see her friends. Yet, she was afraid, too. She wasn't sure how much she was going to be able to tell them. 


 


She was still trying to cope with the new information about her bond and about a child growing inside her. Hermione was determined to talk with the others who had been prisoners. Fleur said they had all been obliviated - that their memories skipped from the battle to being at Nott Manor, but perhaps someone had escaped that or overheard something. She knew it was a feeble hope, but she was so desperate to know more about her situation.


 


Tucking all those thoughts aside for the moment, she looked around the Headmistress's office, finding her way quickly to the bookshelves that housed the Head's books particular to Hogwarts. Here and there she would find one that looked useful and tuck it into her beaded bag. Hermione was trying to focus on her task, but her mind kept wandering.


 


She was surprised that no one was there to greet her, but not necessarily unhappy. She adored Minerva, but she was afraid to tell 

her

 what had happened, too. Would her favorite professor think less of her? Logically, whatever happened wasn't her fault. She should probably be thanking Merlin she 

didn't 

remember it. A teenage pregnancy was not, however, something she was raised to look on kindly. And the timing of this one couldn't be worse.


 


She was thinking about it again. Hermione huffed at herself. After days of thinking about little else, she still couldn't forget it for more than a few seconds at a time, sending her mind spinning again. With a deep breath, she descended the stairs and moved out into the hallway. It was just about lunchtime. She supposed that would be an easy way to see everyone at once, but she honestly didn't know how she would respond to such a crowd. 


 


Hermione felt relief then nervousness sweep over her when a gaggle of redheads turned the nearest corner and rushed to her. Of all the people she couldn't wait to see, they were some of her favorites, but also included the one she was most afraid to tell. They called her name and in moments, she was surrounded by Ginny, George, Ron, and Percy, everyone talking at once, and Hermione found herself laughing and crying at the same time. All of the stress just melted out of her in their arms. 


 


After the group attacked her as a whole, each of them hugged her in turn, ending with Ron. He held her for long moments. Hermione wished she could stay there safe in his arms forever. But then, slowly, he put his hands on her shoulders and pushed her just slightly away from him, forcing her chin to tip up to look at him. He took advantage of the moment and crashed his mouth onto hers. A small cheer went up around them. 


 


She tried to calm her wildly beating heart and tell the butterflies in her stomach to calm themselves. This was everything she had been wanting for years. It was a reprisal of the kiss they had shared during the battle, but this time without the threat of imminent death. This kiss existed just because he wanted to kiss her. 


 


Hermione needed to stop it. She couldn't do this to him, to the two of them. He had to know what had happened. Instead of giving in to the passion, she began to push against his chest. Ron made a small sound and encircled her closer, tight enough that she could barely squirm and couldn't push against him. When she moved her head to the side, he began trailing kisses across her face and onto her neck. Hermione shivered at the feel but knew she couldn't give into it.


 


""Ron, stop,"" she whispered, not wanting to embarrass him in front of his siblings. 


 


Between kisses to her neck, he said, ""No way, Mione. You disappeared on me for almost a month after that first kiss. I'm never letting you go again.""


 


She tried to laugh but knew it came out both breathless and annoyed. ""Ronald Weasley, let me go now. I have to...to tell you some things.""


 


Ron rolled his eyes, but stopped kissing her, released her arms, and stood to his full height, towering over her. ""Mione, can you stop being so bossy for a few minutes? I just want a proper snog from the love of my life.""


 


Hermione had no idea what to even say. Her mouth was open in a silent ""Oh"" of both girlish romance and incredulity that he had decided this while she was missing. He took advantage of it by slipping his tongue into her mouth and moving his lips over hers while she stood dumbstruck. 


 


""Snogging is better if you move your mouth and tongue a bit,"" Ron told her in an exasperated tone before diving back on her. The comment shook her out of her wide-eyed inaction. She began pushing at his chest again, her tongue trying to fight his off. ""Yeah, that's better,"" he said with a grin as she forced him out of her mouth. 


 


She had no idea what to say. She ducked her head away from him and kept pushing at his chest. Relief filled her when another hand appeared and pushed Ron back a step. 


 


""I think she's done snogging, Ron,"" George said. His hand was still firmly pressed to his little brother's chest.


 


""Tell him you were enjoying it just fine, Mione,"" Ron said, confused and irritated. Red was creeping up his cheeks and onto his ears. Ginny and Percy were watching with confused and apprehensive expressions. 


 


""I...it's not that I didn't enjoy it, Ron,"" though she had to admit it had been rather...wetter, sloppier than the kisses she had with Viktor years ago. ""It's...I have some things I have to tell you. I don't think...I don't know what happened, but..."" Hermione couldn't go on without tears starting down her cheeks.


 


Ron looked genuinely upset, ""I'm sorry, Mione. Tell me anything. Nothing you can say will bother me.""


 


She just began crying harder and ran back into his arms to be held. The two stayed like that for a long moment. Ron was gently rubbing her back and kissed the top of her head a couple of times. George stepped back with the other two, but his arms were crossed in front of his chest. 


 


""Now what do you need to tell me? Us? Or do you need them to go away?"" Ron's tone suggested that he would relish being the only one she told. 


 


She shook her head. She couldn't bear to tell them each individually. She would already have to repeat this all far too many times. ""Wait,"" she had just realized, ""Where's Harry?""


 


Ron practically growled, ""Gone to a safehouse. We'll talk about him later. Right now you have something to tell me."" Getting impatient, Ron cajoled, ""Come on, Mione. We know you were obliviated. The barmy arseholes seem to think it's fun to do to people on the regular. Even if you remember something, nothing that happened while you were there is your fault.""


 


Ginny was agreeing and placed a hand on Hermione's back in support. Hermione half-turned and clutched at the other girl's hand. 


 


""Maybe,"" she finally said, ""but, the things that happened are still going to affect my life. I have this...""


 


""Oh, is this about that bond?"" Ron interrupted with a laugh. ""Ol' McGonagall mentioned it. If Bill hasn't found a way to break it yet, he will. He's the best.""


 


""Ron, let her talk,"" Ginny admonished when she felt Hermione flinch at his words.


 


Hermione was so glad she was there. She didn't know if she would be able to make this conversation happen the way it needed to without support. With a deep breath, she explained, ""Bill won't be breaking the bond. He tried. It was...painful in ways I can't even explain."" 


 


Ron started to interrupt but halted when Hermione raised her hand to his lips to stall him. She continued, her voice breaking, ""We've found out more about it, and done some testing. It's...it's a marriage bond. It seems to be...""


 


""You got 

married

?"" Ron was suddenly turning a deep shade of red. Ginny gripped Hermione's hand harder as her brother pushed away from her.


 


""As far as we can tell, it...""


 


""Who?"" Ron demanded. His voice was quiet, but Hermione could hear his rage underneath the calm facade. ""Who did you get married to when we're supposed to be together?""


 


""I don't know,"" she said, barely louder than a whisper. Tears streamed down her face as the horror of that hit her again like a punch to the gut. The person on the other end of that bond could be anyone. ""The bond...the bond was there when I woke up. Bill believes it is a blood bond.""


 


""Bill can break blood bonds. He's talked about the ritual. It will be intense, but I'll be there for you. We can fix this. Everything will be okay again,"" Ron said. 


 


The look he was giving her was so certain that she almost believed it for a moment. Merlin, she wanted to. ""We... we can't break it, Ron.""


 


""Can't or won't?"" he growled.


 


""Please listen, Ron. There's more than that...""


 


""Will you die? If you try to get rid of it?"" He demanded, a triumphant look in his eyes.


 


""It is very likely I would. Ron, you don't understand. Bill says...""


 


""Fine. So Bill can't do it? We'll do it without him,"" Ron continued with barely a pause for breath. ""We can fix this ourselves. Poppy and McGonagall are the best! They'll know how to fix you.""


 


""Ron, they can't fix this,"" Hermione was feeling desperate.


 


""You can research it,"" he insisted. ""You're the Brightest Witch of Your Age, you can figure this out.""


 


""I really can't, Ron,"" she whispered, trying to stop the tears flowing down her cheeks. 


 


""So you're not even willing to try?"" He was watching her incredulously.


 


""It's permanent, Ron. There's no way around it."" She knew how defeated she sounded, but she couldn't help it. She needed him to understand. And the rest of it needed to come out. She couldn't keep feeling this tension and knowing she was hiding things from the people who mattered most.


 


""I need to go do something else before I say something I'll regret,"" Ron said, his eyes cold as he stared at her like she was a piece of trash beneath him.


 


""No, please Ron. I need to tell you the rest,"" Hermione begged. She couldn't go through this multiple times. She caught his arm and pulled back.


 


Ron stood silently staring at the wall behind her before his face slowly swung to hers. His voice started out low and crescendoed into screaming, ""The rest? What the bloody hell else could you have to tell me? You got a permanent bond to a Death Eater. Did you fuck him too?"" Ron was sneering at her the way he had under the influence of the hated Horcrux locket. A piece of Hermione's brain wondered if it might have altered something in his personality permanently. 


 


""Ron!"" Ginny hissed. ""She didn't have a choice. She did what she had to and...""


 


""No!"" Ron snapped, glaring at his sister acidly before turning back on Hermione. ""You did, didn't you?""


 


Hermione flushed, a new wave of tears gushing out of her.


 


""You did fuck him,"" Ron snarled. ""I bet you loved every second of it!""


 


""Ron!"" George shouted, putting himself between Ron and Hermione, but Ron leaned around him.


 


""Bet you just expected me to be okay with this. You and your happy little Death Eater family. When's the baby due? I'll send you a fucking present."" Ron was practically spitting with rage.


 


""I..."" Hermione choked. She curled into Ginny's side and sobbed, ""I'm not sure when I'm due.""


 


""What?"" Ron froze. ""What do you mean, Hermione?""


 


""I mean I'm going to have a little Death Eater baby, Ronald,"" she said between sobs. ""I assume. It could be anyone's, but... well... that's the most logical answer. I don't know who the father is. I don't know who I'm married to. I don't 

know

 what the fucking was like, Ronald, or if I liked it. I don't know anything."" She would have collapsed if Ginny hadn't been holding on to her.


 


Ron was staring at her dumbfounded. George and Percy both looked on in shock. Ginny held her tight, rubbing circles on her back, but there was surprise and pity on her face that she couldn't hide. Hermione couldn't stop trembling as she waited for the explosion. She knew it was coming as she watched his face getting redder by the second.


 


""How could you?!?!"" Ron finally yelled at her, ""You... you SLAG! You cheating-"" 


 


He went on, but George shot him with 

Silencio 

so they wouldn't have to hear it. ""Perce, get him out of here!"" George begged as he rushed to Hermione's side. 


 


""She should have let him walk away,"" Percy commented. ""Hermione, you had to know how volatile he was going to be.""


 


George looked furiously at Percy, too. Their older brother sighed and began dragging Ron down the hallway and away. 


 


Even with George and Ginny there, Hermione felt like her whole world had just fallen apart. Ron hated her. He had gone from calling her the love of his life, the very thing she had hoped for the two of them for several years now, to calling her a slag within minutes of each other. 


 


""Don't listen to him, Hermione,"" George said.


 


""He's an arsehole!"" Ginny exclaimed. Both remaining siblings were nearly as red as Ron had been, filled with righteous fury that their brother would have treated her that way. 


 


George pulled her into a tight hug, ""You didn't do anything wrong, Hermione. You know you didn't.""


 


""But I don't!"" she wailed. ""I have no idea what I did or didn't do. All I know is what is wrong with me now.""


 


""You didn't have a choice,"" George countered.


 


""What if I did?"" The words came out in a whisper as she pulled back, her horror at the thought apparent in every syllable.


 


""If you did then you had your reasons at the time. Not knowing is awful, but Hermione, anyone with any sense trusts your judgment,"" George told her earnestly.


 


""There is nothing wrong with being married and pregnant. Having it done to you against your will is wrong, but even if that's not what happened, there is no reason for 

you

 to feel guilty,"" Ginny declared. 


 


""But Ron..."" Hermione started before another sob bubbled up.


 


""Ron doesn't own you. And even if you had promised him something - which from what I understand, you didn't - he would have no reason to treat you like he just did,"" Ginny insisted.


 


She had no response to that. Hermione knew that when she had calmed down she would be able to see Ron's behavior in a different light, but all she could do now was react. She was so overwhelmed with emotions and that led her right back to thinking about the baby.


 


""What am I going to do, Gin?"" Hermione cried. ""I can't have a baby. We're at war! I have to help Harry fight the Dark Lord.""


 


""You have us to help you,"" George spoke up, ""Our whole family - except maybe that git - will be there for you. You're one of us no matter what, Hermione. Mum will be ecstatic to have a baby to watch and spoil.""


 


""And there's Andromeda. She has Teddy and keeps several other little ones these days. You should get to know her,"" Ginny suggested.


 


Seeing how sad she still was, George gently pulled her into his chest again and said, ""Everyone will be here for you, Hermione. Even Ron. Give him a little time and he'll realize you're worth so much more than these little things in your way.""


 


Hermione sniffled and laughed, ""I hardly think a marriage bond is a little thing in the way of Ron and I being together like he wants.""


 


George sighed before saying, ""Were you in pain when he was kissing you? It looked like you were anxious, but you didn't seem like you were hurting.""


 


""No, there wasn't any pain,"" she looked confused for a flash, then realization dawned across her features. ""The bond doesn't include fidelity! I may not be able to break it, but I don't have to behave as though I'm married to some stranger far away. Oh, George!"" Laughing, she gave him a quick peck on the cheek and spun around to hug Ginny. 


 


""You've both helped me so much just now!"" Hermione said happily before falling back down into sadness, ""I still don't know how I'm going to face everyone else and answer questions and everything.""


 


""With us right by your side, Hermione,"" Ginny said.


 

This is a long one! We had lots to finish up at Hogwarts, and I couldn't very well forget about Draco either. Again, no triggers. We're on a nice break from them, I think, for some time. Having said that, I will inevitably edit something awful into next chapter. 

My alpha omnenomnom and beta highlyintelligentblonde are both much appreciated.

Harry Potter doesn't belong to me.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Friday, May 29, 1998; afternoon


 


Draco felt uncomfortable and angry. He was still furious with Blaise, for one thing. Not only had he held him down and forced the Draught on him, the man had also refused to give him any information about his mother beyond that she was alive. It had occurred to Draco now that he really didn't know how many times this might have happened to her. Either at Voldemort's hands or Dolohov's. Blaise undoubtedly knew and hadn't said a word.


 


Still, this particular feeling had come on suddenly just a few hours ago. It was something to do with the bond and therefore frustrating. Since the pain and then the dream a few days ago, it had been bothering him, in ways that were different from before. He had the feeling Granger was very emotional wherever she was. He kept feeling echoed waves of despair and anger and occasionally determination. It was making him crazy with the urge to go help her, make things right again. It was like a physical itch under his skin that he could do nothing about.


 


Today, though. Whatever had happened today was more directly to do with 

him.

 It wasn't an echo, but more a feeling of his own discomfort at whatever happened. There had even been a few minutes of prickling pain, mostly on his lips. He didn't know what to make of it, but he was certain he didn't like it. He also didn't like the echoed explosion of despair and anxiety he felt from her afterwards.


 


Draco tried to put his mind on something else. He was supposed to be doing research. For their plan to work for Charlie, someone needed to be able to spy on the guards in training, particularly when they were out on the grounds dueling. Even if one of them could manage to spy on them in their quarters - tough since the servants' halls didn't extend into that lesser part of the manor where they were housed - it wouldn't let them know the prospective's fighting abilities, which Charlie would need to mimic. 


 


His mind wouldn't focus. He kept being overwhelmed by all 

her 

bloody feelings. He wanted another dream so he could demand to know what the hell was going on even though it wouldn't really help. But maybe his subconscious could give him a reasonable story to believe. And now he was desperate to pick a fight with himself under the guise of a dream. He had really lost the plot in here hadn't he?


 


A frustrated sigh escaped him. This research was important. Charlie was clearly going crazy stuck in here. And the sooner he could infiltrate the guards, the sooner he could break Tonks out and get them out of here. Not that he exactly wanted the man gone. 


 


He did want him to be free and safe, but Draco had to admit he was hilarious and a complete adrenaline junkie with the wildest stories he'd ever heard. He could also hold a deeply intellectual conversation if it was a topic of interest for him. Draco didn't want to accept that a blood traitor Weasley was a pretty damn good friend, but... he really enjoyed having him around, especially with friends being a bit thin on the ground these days.


 


Just the other day, the two had debated for hours on the merits of becoming animagi. Trapped as they were, it would be something to make it feel like all this time they were wasting was worthwhile. He just wished Charlie could already become an animal of some sort. That would solve this whole problem.


 


Wait! Draco grabbed a potions book from his discarded pile and skimmed back through it. Yes! There was a Transfiguration Potion that would allow the person to turn into an animal of their choosing. That would do well enough until they could become animagi. 


 


The potion was complicated, but he thought he could manage it. Thank Merlin for his godfather insisting that he ""go above and beyond the education demands of the unwashed masses."" Draco smiled wryly, then bit his lip and tried not to think about how much he missed the man. He couldn't believe the Dark Lord had killed him.


 


Shaking the memory away, he began maneuvering himself out of bed and headed for the potions lab. He would have Charlie assist him for the more complicated parts. Together, they were going to get out of this mess. He didn't even realize that his thoughts had turned to acceptance that it was past time to go.


 


******************************


 


At last, she could settle into the comforting smell of books and peaceful serenity of the library. Hermione needed some time to process how lunch had gone. None of the prisoners who had been captured with her at the battle remembered anything. They were all just as frustrated as she was, the feeling of violation intense. Only, no one else had the kinds of lasting reminders she did. 


 


That wasn't fair, she chided herself. It was possible someone else was suffering similar repercussions. They just didn't have a furious, jealous whatever-Ron-was to storm into the Great Hall and scream it out in front of everyone. The whole situation had come to blows. In front of the stunned assemblage, with his family moving to shut him up, Hermione had taken care of him herself, punching him even harder than she had Malfoy back in third year. He was in the hospital wing now, though she hoped he would be out soon. She needed to see Neville before she left Hogwarts.


 


McGonagall had come to her early in the lunch hour and suggested that she could actually move to living at Hogwarts since it was now under the Fidelius as well. She had been excited that she could come home... until Ron made his scene. There was no way she could live here with him in the same building, even if it was a gigantic castle. Her nerves were strung so tight as it was, Hermione couldn't take being around his hostility, too. She would miss everyone else, but at least at Shell Cottage, she was treated with respect and care.



Plus, she needed an environment where she could focus and research. She was waist deep in book piles already, skimming them to find the ones that might offer the most useful segments on warding. She had already gathered books from the Headmistress' office when she arrived. If her beaded bag hadn't already had at least three separate weightlessness charms, she wouldn't have been able to lift it simply from what she had added today. She had a feeling that many of the texts currently surrounding her would end up in the bag as well. 



""Hermione?"" a tentative voice spoke.



She looked up into the earnest eyes of Susan Bones. She had been a member of the DA, but not one Hermione had known well. She had also been among the group of former prisoners she had addressed earlier. Hermione tentatively acknowledged the girl back, ""Susan, can I help with something?""



""No, I was hoping I might help you.""



""You remember something?"" Hermione exclaimed, hope flaring in her veins.



""Nothing myself, but I think there is someone on our side who might be able to help.""



She was confused, but encouraged her to continue. It must be Neville, the one person she hadn't talked to yet. Still, she appreciated Susan coming to her with the suggestion. 



""Theo,"" Susan said.



""Who?"" Hermione didn't know anyone by that name.



""Theodore Nott. Junior, of course.""



""He's on our side?"" Hermione was taken aback. She didn't know much about the boy, just that he was a Slytherin in their year. She would have assumed he would be another Death Eater, following in his father's footsteps like Malfoy. 



""When we were rescued from Nott Manor - Theo had poisoned all the guards and invited Harry, Ron, and Bill into the manor. He showed them where we were. His one condition was that they bring him back with us. He even bargained to be a prisoner if that's what they wanted to do with him. It was what they did, too. Kingsley and Remus and Ron were awful to him. Harry had to get Professor Sprout involved to get him released from the closet they were keeping him in. He's at a safe house now with Harry and Dean watching over him and Goyle.""



""Goyle's with us?"" Hermione asked, astounded. Everything Susan had just told her was baffling.



The girl nodded.



""So..."" Hermione was trying to process all the information she had been given. ""What makes you think Theo could help me?""



""The guards obliviated all of us before we got into Nott Manor, but no one would have obliviated him. From what I know, he was treated as a low-level guard by the Death Eaters, with a little authority when they sent him to his own manor as the temporary Lord. I know he didn't have the mark yet - he only just turned 17 since we've been here - so he may not know anything useful. But... He has his memories intact.""



Hermione hissed air in through her teeth. He might truly know something for her. If he would talk to a mudblood. Did he believe in blood supremacy? He may have switched sides just to escape Voldemort. ""Do you... do you think he would talk to someone like me?""



""A muggleborn, you mean?"" Susan asked curiously. ""I can't claim to know, but... he was kind even to the ones who were. He was witty and some of his comments were biting, but I believe it was an act. I'm no seer, but he seemed like a gentle soul.""



Hope was such a heady, dangerous thing, but Hermione couldn't stop herself from filling with it. ""Thank you, Susan. This means so much to me. I will have to talk to McGonagall about seeing him.""



The other girl turned to leave, before glancing back, ""Hermione, I'm so sorry about the way Ron behaved. You have done nothing to deserve that. It could have happened to any of us. If you ever need anything once the baby is here... I had a large family when I was younger."" There was a definite sadness in her voice, ""I would be honored to help with the baby anytime you need a break.""



The light feeling Hermione operated under as she dove back into her pile of books was almost foreign to her now. Foreign, but very welcome indeed.


 


******************************


 


George seethed with fury at his younger brother. How dare Ron attack Hermione when she had been through so much? How could he not see how much she was struggling? He couldn't believe it. Lunch had been horrible. His whole family was mortified at Ron's behavior. Their mum was still in the hospital wing shouting at him. Bill, Fleur, and Ginny had made it very clear that until he gave a thorough and heartfelt apology to Hermione, he no longer existed for them. Percy was the only one of the siblings still interested in speaking to him, probably as one black sheep to another.



Walking up to the library, George tried to calm down. He didn't want to upset her further. He needed to refocus. He hadn't really thought much yet about the idea that their little Hermione was going to be a mum. Somewhere out there was a man who considered her his, probably in a possession sort of way. The thought made George angry all over again. 



He had to take several steadying breaths before stepping into the library and around the shelves where he knew her favorite study table was located. Seeing her nose buried in a book with a small smile on her face helped dissipate what was left of the anger.



""Oi Hermione!"" he called from across the library. Madam Pince wasn't in residence, but Hermione looked up in a way that made him sure she was about to shush him anyway. With a casual grin, George dropped into the seat next to her. He had done this a hundred times. This was just the first time he hadn't had a counterpart drop on her other side to offer some nefarious deal or beg her not to get them in trouble for something. For a moment, his good mood at seeing her faltered. He pushed back the tidal wave. He would save it for tomorrow. There weren't any scheduled raids for a day or two. He had time to fall apart.



""Can I be of any help?"" he asked. 



Her eyebrow raised and she tipped her head to the side, her wild curls bouncing even with the slight movement. ""You want to help me research?"" she asked incredulously.



""Believe it or not, I'm quite good at it. Inventing products involves a lot of spellwork and potions tweaking. We found out over time that it went better with a bit of background information first. Less explosions that way.""



Hermione smiled, almost laughed even. He could see in her eyes that she was remembering some of the times she had been around for various explosions. It had taken quite a lot of them before they figured out that a deeper understanding of magical theory was necessary. In George's opinion, it was a criminal offense that Hogwarts didn't teach more of that to begin with. 



""Well,"" she smiled at him, ""if you're really offering, you can start on the pile closest to you. We're looking for sections on wards within walls, ancient warding, and sentient wards. If the book contains any of those, mark the segment,"" she pointed to a pile of paper slips, ""and put the book in here."" She indicated her little beaded bag. 


 


George loved that she had created this illegal magical item and used it constantly. He only hoped he could eventually get her to teach him, too. He settled into the research, contemplating tables of contents and skimming sections that looked promising. They were both so focused that it was a surprise when they both reached for the last book.



""Since it's your research, I guess I'll let you have the last go,"" George laughed.


 


She nodded and was instantly absorbed in her task. He watched her, glad she had something to focus on for now. George was worried how she was going to handle things when she couldn't keep herself busy anymore. He knew that was likely to be back at Shell Cottage and it bothered him that she might insist on going through it alone.


 


Fucking Ronnikins. He was such an arsehole when he lost his temper. He had been doing so well of late, but it was still there. George had been shocked when they named him as the General, the primary strategist. He knew his little brother would be good at it, but it was disconcerting that they would allow someone so immature to be in charge of such an important part of the war efforts. For a while, though, he had seemed to be growing up. Now this. 


 


He opened his mouth to ask Hermione how she was doing when his eldest brother strode into the library. Bill cut over to them immediately. He looked somewhere between angry and worried.



""Hermione, are you doing okay? I'm so sorry about...""



""It's fine, Bill. Not your fault,"" she cut him off. ""Ron is the only one responsible for his repulsive behavior."" 


 


She clearly didn't want to discuss it further. George could tell it was making his brother crazy to let it go without the full family apology he wanted to extend. Bill felt responsible for what was left of them now. Even though Mum and Dad were capable of speaking up, they didn't have the weight behind their words that they once did. They hadn't been able to protect them all. It was a failure in their eyes. Bill was trying to shoulder the heavy burden of keeping the family running as their parents sunk into a sense of despair. 


 


After a moment of warring with himself on what to say, Bill asked, ""Are you almost done here? I think it might be best if we leave before dinner."" Nervously, he explained, ""I need to check on Fleur, you know."" 


 


Hermione lifted an eyebrow but nodded. Her voice was sad when she said, ""Yes, I was hoping to avoid dinner, too, since lunch went so well. I do still need to see Neville in the hospital wing. Do you...do you think they've released Ronald yet?""


 


Bill nodded, ""I just came from there. He has been escorted to his room.""


 


Relief washed over George that everyone was working to keep Ron away from her now that the way he treated her had been witnessed. Hermione stuffed the last book into her bag and pulled the strap over her shoulder. The three of them headed out of the library and down to see Neville.


 


*******************************


 


Hermione was so glad to see Neville alive and well. The last thing she remembered about him, he had been on the battlefield right in front of Voldemort. She had been told he was taken captive, given to Bellatrix, and rescued at Charlie Weasley's insistence and expense. The entire saga had brought Hermione to tears. It was a testament to that evil woman's torture skills that Neville was still in the hospital almost a month later. No one was willing to think about what that meant for Charlie.


 


They greeted one another with a hug, Neville walking shakily to meet her. She laughed as she looked around at the bed that had to be Neville's and the way his gifts spiraled out of control through that whole section of the infirmary. ""Have you relocated the greenhouse?""


 


""I rather hope so,"" he said with a smile. ""If not, they're going to want me to carry all these to it when I'm finally well enough.""


 


They exchanged pleasantries for a few moments before Neville's face took on a serious cast. ""Ron was in here earlier,"" he firmly stated, ""I heard the rubbish he was saying to you.                                                                   I know you're going to get through it and prove to everyone it's just another thing you're amazing at.""


 


She sniffed back tears at her friend's heartfelt declaration. It didn't make her any more confident that she was ready to be a mum, but the support meant a lot. Taking a deep breath, she steered the conversation to what they were really there for. ""Neville, I have some questions for you that... I'm hoping that someone knows something about my situation. Do you mind talking about things there?""


 


Neville swallowed hard, but nodded. ""I'm in a bit of a unique position, I know,"" he said. ""They never got around to obliviating me since I was unconscious for most of the time from the beginning of that first night's revel until I woke in Bellatrix's rooms a day or two later.""


 


Hermione leaned forward, eagerness and trepidation warring in her heart, hoping for information he might be able to provide. 


 


He looked into her eyes, but solemnly shook his head. ""I'm afraid I'm not going to have what you want to know. I remember waking up in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor. McGonagall and Flitwick were there.""


 


""Flitwick?"" Hermione queried. She hadn't heard anyone mention him at all. She felt a surge of guilt that she had forgotten the tiny man.


 


""I don't know what happened to him,"" Neville said, ""No one does. I suspect the worst, but maybe he's just hidden away at some Death Eater's home."" Taking a deep breath, Neville continued on his story, ""You were the last one of us to wake, shortly before Malfoy brought us food we weren't supposed to have and warned us about being the entertainment for the night at their revel.""


 


""Malfoy? The boy who's been bullying us our entire school career? 

That

 Malfoy?"" Incredulous didn't even cover how Hermione felt about that. Then again, he had been a lot better lately until this most recent... What was she thinking? Those were nothing but dreams. She chastised herself for the blending of her subconscious and reality. Neville fortunately didn't seem to notice her inner conflict and started to speak his part.                                                                                                                                                                                             


 


""The very one,"" Neville agreed. ""I don't think he's enjoying being a Death Eater after all. He tried to help us that night and then, twice when Bellatrix had me, he came in with ridiculous reasons he needed her to leave with him. Gave me enough time to recover a bit between or she would have driven me mad.""


 


""So once they hauled us up out of the dungeon, we were all taken single file up to this huge room. Voldy has a big throne there. He looked us over and wanted me tortured. I was out cold after just a few minutes, Hermione. Then there's nothing in my head until I woke up with Bellatrix and Charlie there with me, at least a day, maybe more, later.""


 


The hope she had been holding withered away. Even knowing more than the others, he didn't know anything about her fate. She tried to keep her feelings off her face, but Hermione had never been wonderful at that. Neville gently took her hands. 


 


""I don't know anything else useful about that time, but I know you made it out. I know you're struggling and none of this is fair to any of us who should just be kids right now, but I know we're going to get through this war together and show Voldy and his Death Eaters that they can't take our world away."" Neville paused and brushed a couple of tears from her face. ""I know you'll be a great mum, and even if Ron's a wanker, there are plenty of us who'll be your baby's stand-in daddy or one of a hundred uncles, whatever you need from us. You haven't gotten to see him yet, I guess, but I know Harry will be right behind you all the way, Hermione.""


 


She sobbed as his arms went around her from in front, and she felt hands come from behind to steady her shoulders, Bill and George lending their support. Hermione slumped into the three of them, the tears pouring out of her along with the last of her energy. She had been rather fatigued most days lately. With the emotional intensity of this day, she had nothing left. When Neville let go of their hug and stepped back, she almost fell. George's quick reflexes were the only thing that kept her off the floor. 


 


Within moments, she was stretched on one of the beds and Madam Pomfrey had rushed out of her office to tend her. A healing diagnostic popped up over her head. The madam began tutting. ""You need gentle food and lots of sleep, child. We're going to give you some soup and then, are you moving into the castle tonight?""


 


""No!"" Hermione nearly shouted, even through her exhaustion. ""No, I don't think it would be wise for me to be in the same castle as Ronald Weasley,"" she said bitterly.


 


Madam Pomfrey nodded. ""That might be for the best, dear."" Addressing Bill, she said, ""I'll be giving you a variety of potions for her to take when you get her home. Now Hermione, I will also send a multivitamin potion. You are to try and eat properly, but take this potion daily as well, just to be sure that you and the baby are getting enough nutrients."" With that, Pomfrey turned and went back to her office to gather the potions.


 


A pop of apparition made Hermione jump. Standing before her, a tray laden with steaming soup in her hands, was Mimsy. The little elf looked stunned for a moment, then her eyes narrowed. She gently set the tray down and said, ""Mistress Hermione, yous not be taking care of yous self."" Her fists were on her hips now and she was scolding her full force, one finger wagging at her mistress. ""If yous not be sending Mimsy away, this not be happening. Yous need Mimsy back.""


 


""Absolutely not,"" Hermione declared. ""If you hadn't been so surprised to see me, I'm not sure I could trust you enough to eat this soup. How did you get to Hogwarts?""


 


Bill cleared his throat awkwardly. ""That was my doing, Hermione. She fixed up a lot of the damage around The Burrow, but once the Fidelius was in place here, I told Mum to summon her here. She doesn't have anything more to do at the Burrow until someone goes home there, and I thought Mum could use her help. She's still not very well recovered.""


 


Madam Pomfrey handed an entire satchel full of potions to Bill as she broke into the conversation, ""And Molly sent her here as she's far too stubborn to accept that she needs that help."" The matron rolled her eyes and continued, ""Mimsy has been most helpful to Professor Snape and I both in tending patients and helping with potions. I hear she is also excellent in the kitchens and a godsend with young Teddy Lupin and the other little ones in the castle. I can't imagine the story of you, Miss Granger, acquiring a house elf or why you would send her away when you clearly need her excellent assistance, but I will say that if I hear of your health deteriorating this way again, I will insist she be sent back to you. And your protests will be ignored, young lady.""


 


Mimsy looked very pleased as she bowed and said, ""Mimsy bes honored to serve you, Mistress Hermione. I hopes yous let Mimsy back soon.""


 


Finishing as much of her soup as she could handle without it coming back up, Hermione pushed the tray away and looked to Bill. ""Please can we go home now? I can't stay here a moment longer.""


 


""Of course,"" he answered. They were soon on their way to McGonagall's office and the floo back to Shell Cottage.


 


*********************************


 


Bill's anxiety was high as he walked Hermione slowly to the Headmistress' office. It had been a very long day talking with Kingsley and McGonagall. Ron should have been there, because they should have been making plans for raids and discussing how to break into Malfoy Manor again. Unfortunately his youngest brother had lost his mind. How could he let petty jealousy allow him to treat one of his best friends that way, no matter how else he felt about her?


 


Of course he knew that Fleur was fine at home by herself, but it was hard for him to be away from her for any length of time. This had been an all day affair. Bill made a vow to himself that the next time they were coming to the castle, he would insist she come, too. He just felt safer knowing she was nearby.


 


As he steered his charge through the office toward the floo, he was impatient with all the goodbyes she had to say. Ginny was back, and George was clinging to Hermione. Bill was grateful for the friendship they seemed to be building, but it was frustrating at this moment. He just wanted everyone to let her go. McGonagall was the last to wish them well, before they were finally allowed to the floo. He tossed the powder in and said, ""Shell Cottage,"" knowing Hermione was just behind him.


 


Large, strong hands roughly grabbed hold of him the moment he stepped out of his fireplace.


 

Aren't cliffhangers fun? Come yell at me in the comments!

Trigger Warning for the last scene: Torture, Bellatrix being a crazy bitch  

That scene is dedicated to raleigh_bird who was amused and here for my comment that I wasn't planning on needing trigger warnings but would inevitably put one in since I said that.

My alpha, omnenomnom, and my beta, highlyintelligentblonde, are still awesome at helping me along this journey.

I do not own Harry Potter.


Hermione came out of the floo only a minute after Bill to a scene that made her gasp in surprise and fear. Directly across from her, coming down the staircase, were two Death Eaters in full mask and robes, wands drawn. To her left, there was another such figure, this one huge, grappling with Bill. There was no sign of Fleur, though Bill was now bellowing for her with a feral tone. The Death Eater he was up against was not faring well. 


 


The other two headed straight for her. Hermione's wand was in her bag at the moment. She had been too tired to even carry her wand. Adrenaline pumped through her system now, and she threw a hand forward at them, putting everything she had into a wandless 

bombarda

. She felt the sparkling along her bond thread and saw part of the stair railing explode as one of the men blasted practically through it. The second man was on the ground as she found herself running toward him, not even bothering to find her wand. As she got close, the man slid along the floor in front of her until he slammed into a wall. Hermione had no explanation for what just happened but was glad when the man she had just thrown to the wall jumped up, grabbed his compatriot, and disapparated on the spot.


 


She fumbled in her purse for her wand, then turned to see how Bill was faring with the bigger man. Her eyes widened to see that Bill held the man up off the ground by his neck, snarls coming from him as he shook the man and practically howled at the choking Death Eater. If it were a full moon, she would fear he was going to turn wolf. Hoping to calm him, she set off up the stairs, searching for Fleur.


 


All of the doors upstairs were torn open: their things destroyed and strewn about. Inside the master suite, though, the bathroom door was closed and, Hermione soon found out, spelled to repel all attempts to get in. ""Fleur!"" she cried, but it seemed that sound wasn't getting through. Unable to think of anything else, she sent her Patronus with a message to Fleur. Her dragon flew straight through the door. Moments later, Fleur threw open the door and hugged Hermione with everything she had. 


 


""Beel, where eez he?"" she asked. She looked disheveled and had clearly been crying, but otherwise seemed unharmed.


 


""He's downstairs fighting off the last of them, Fleur. He's...gone a little crazy.""


 


""I 'ear him now,"" she said with a nod. ""Of course 'e's gone crazy. 'E eez afraid his mate eez in danger again!""


 


Fleur ran down the stairs to her love. Bill dropped the Death Eater, no longer a problem, to the ground and enveloped his wife in his arms. Hermione felt like an intruder watching them. 


 


With the adrenaline suddenly draining from her system, she also felt very faint. Her overtaxed magical core was throbbing with an emptiness that she felt inside and out. She had done it again - yanked his magic to her and burnt herself out. Probably him, too, whoever he was. She lowered herself to sit on the stairs before she fell down them instead. She fell asleep right there, only slightly aware when the other two moved near her.


 


""Hermione."" Bill shook her fully awake. 


 


Fleur sat next to her. ""We must leave 'ere, Hermione. The floo 'as been compromised. They came in right after you left theez morning."" 


 


""I have portkeys. In an emergency like this, we're supposed to scatter to different safe houses. Fleur and I will be staying together, but I'm going to send you to the house where Harry is, ok?""


 


Hermione nodded. She felt dizzy and depleted. The thought of taking a portkey was not a pleasant one. Shoving the satchel Madam Pomfrey had given him into her hands, Bill tried to help her stand but gave up after a moment. 


 


""Perhaps it's best if you do this from a sitting position,"" he said, looking worried.


 


There was a sound across the room downstairs - the floo flaring to life. All Hermione could really see trying to look around Bill was that the room was filling with black. Then her world was spinning with the sickening sensation of a portkey.


 


*************************************



A spell flew near his right ear but Harry didn't dodge that one. There was another hurtling at his head to the left, so he dove to the right as soon as the first spell passed him. He was almost in the clear, but Theo had bent to the ground, blasting the next spell from down low. Harry began laughing as he was tickled everywhere. 


 


""You got me! Let me go!"" he giggled. 


 


Theo was too busy laughing to let Harry out of the spell for a couple of minutes. The many spectators were in a similar state. A group of new Order members had arrived the day before to join the four boys. All but one of them were excited at the prospect of dueling training with Harry Potter and his team. 


 


Harry wasn't sure when he, Dean, Theo, and Goyle had become a team, but they worked almost seamlessly together. He found that he really enjoyed Theo's humor, and Greg wasn't so bad without Malfoy ordering him around. He was as silent as a boulder, but he occasionally smiled at something and always worked hard in a duel, though he sometimes reverted to physical dueling rather than magical. Harry had always been friendly with Dean, but their current situation had given him more opportunity than ever before to get to know his long-time roommate.


 


Once the laughter calmed, Harry stood in front of them all and began his questions. ""What did I do wrong? What could I have done better?""


 


A few hands raised. ""You there, in the orange?""


 


The girl opened her mouth to answer when there was an odd sound, the warning the wards had been crossed and a body dropped on the ground not far away. Everyone turned with wands out, and Harry headed toward the person. They hadn't moved, hadn't tried to get up, and that was worrisome. As he got closer and saw a mass of familiar bushy curls, he ran.


 


""Hermione!"" he skidded to a halt beside her, looking her over for any signs of injury. There was nothing. She looked incredibly pale but was otherwise physically fine as far as he could tell.



Looking around at the crowd that had followed him, he asked, ""Does anyone have any healing knowledge?""


 


A woman near the back of the group stepped forward - the one who hadn't been interested in dueling practice, Harry noted. ""I'm not good at it, but I can do a bit. Standard diagnostics and what muggles call first aid.""


 


Harry nodded and the woman dropped next to him. She muttered a spell and glowing runes appeared above Hermione. The woman looked puzzled for a moment. ""No injuries, but...I've never seen a magical core so empty. The girl is worn through. She needs rest - probably for days.""


 


""How did she get here?"" Dean wondered aloud.


 


""I don't know,"" Harry said as he gathered her up in his arms and started toward the house, ""but we won't get the story until she's had some time to recover. Someone grab her things.""


 


Theo picked up the little beaded bag and a much heavier satchel. Peeking inside, he commented, ""If she didn't come straight from there, she's been to Hogwarts recently. This is from Madam Pomfrey.""


 


Harry paused, ""Let's hope she didn't come straight from there in this condition or we'll need to be ready for lots more.""








When they had her in a bedroom, Harry took off her socks and shoes and tucked her in. He guessed she might be more comfortable in some different clothes, but he was loath to be the one who changed her. Theo was standing nearby, sorting through the many potions Madam Pomfrey had sent. He had a strange look on his face as he bit his lower lip. 


 


""What is it?"" Harry asked.


 


The other boy clearly didn't want to answer, not meeting his eyes as he looked into the bag. ""I think she must have been in a similar state when she was at Hogwarts. There are lots of nutrition potions and sleeping draughts.""


 


Harry wondered if they ought to give her one of each when he heard the telltale sound of someone else coming through the wards. He swore as he gave her one last look and took off at a run to see who was here now. He missed the look of awe Theo gave the girl in the bed and the fact that he gently touched her stomach before following Harry.


 


Before they could make it out of the house, a tall formidable woman burst in the front door. At first glance, Harry brandished his wand. Her resemblance to Bellatrix always took his breath away. ""Andromeda,"" he said with relief as he lowered his wand again, ""What's happened?""


 


""They said you took Hermione up to one of the bedrooms?"" she queried. 


 


""Yes, ma'am,"" he responded, ""I can show you.""


 


She rushed along behind him until they came to the room he had just placed Hermione in. 



Andromeda cast the healing diagnostics, a more complicated version than the new member had done, and sighed. ""From what I've been told, this girl will never learn,"" she said, shaking her head. 


 


""What's wrong with her?"" Harry asked, more firmly this time. He was getting very tired of not knowing what was going on. 


 


""She's depleted all her resources,"" Andromeda explained. ""She was already exhausted and overwrought at the castle today, then she went back to Shell Cottage with Bill and they found the house had been compromised."" 


 


""Compromised?""


 


""There were Death Eaters there. They had been terrorizing poor Fleur all day, waiting for someone else to arrive. Whether their target was Hermione or Bill or both, no one knows. Once they were home, they fought off the three who were there before. Bill says Hermione displayed some very impressive wandless magic. It saved them, but it was still foolish of her to expend so much energy in her condition. Death Eaters began pouring in through the floo then, so Bill activated the emergency portkeys. He thought she would do best with you near.""


 


""What do you mean by her condition?"" Harry asked.


 


Ignoring his question, Andromeda continued with what had happened. ""We have shut down the floo system. They somehow infiltrated it and were able to come in once someone activated it. It bypassed the Fidelius on the cottage.""


 


""Was it just the cottage or all the safe houses?""


 


""We don't know,"" Andromeda said, worry lining her face. ""There's talk that they may pull everyone back to Hogwarts, but I don't know yet. I'm here to take care of Hermione.""


 


""What's wrong with her?"" Harry asked, worried for the friend he considered a sister.


 


Andromeda looked at him for a moment before saying, ""I think it is best if we give her the space to tell you herself. She lost that right at the castle and it's part of why she's in this state.""


 


""Hold onto it, then. I can wait,"" Harry assured. He didn't want to wait, but he didn't want to make anything worse for Hermione either.


 


""Good. I'm going to sleep in the room here with her. I left Teddy with Molly and Ginny at the castle. They should be fine for a couple of days without me. Harry, she's going to be fine. She just needs a lot of rest and good, wholesome food. Now get out of here and rest yourself. She should be awake by morning.""


 


************************************TRIGGER WARNING: TORTURE, Bellatrix


 


Blaise was already exhausted when he was summoned to Bellatrix's room. There had been all the daily checks to make, unsanctioned potions to sneak, that sort of thing. Then a raid somewhere had gone wrong. There had been those who needed patching up from the raid itself and then a much bigger group who had to recover from the Dark Lord's wrath at their failure. Their story was fascinating, though, and he looked forward to telling Charlie and Draco about it - once Draco had recovered anyway.


 


But he couldn't think about that right now. He needed to focus on whatever batshit crazy thing Bellatrix wanted now. Was she going to try to force her way into his mind again to reveal Charlie? Or had she hurt someone new again trying to replace him?  


 


Of course thinking about that, about the things Bellatrix did to people, just made Blaise worry about the redhead even more than he already was. Since Draco had found that damn potion and brewed it for him, Charlie was going out as various small animals to find the perfect Death Eater recruit to impersonate. It made Blaise sick with anxiety. What would happen to Charlie if he were caught? He couldn't yet face the thought of the man actually going out to become a guard once he selected someone. 


 


Pausing before entering Bellatrix's room, Blaise took a few steadying breaths. He hated going through this door more than practically any other. Knowing that a further delay would only make things worse, he knocked lightly and stepped into the room. As the door swung open, his heart stopped.


 


Laying on the floor with Bellatrix leering above him was Charlie, stripped nude except for a delicate collar around his neck, beaten and bloody. Blaise couldn't breathe. He wanted to cry, wanted to run to the man on the floor and protect him from that evil, vicious...


 


Charlie screamed in a voice that wasn't his. ""Fuck you, you absolute bitch!""


 


""That's not what Charlie says! He loves me. You're doing it wrong,"" Bellatrix whined. 


 


""Loves you? Ha! If he loves you why did he run away-""


 


""He would never run away! He was stolen!"" Bellatrix shouted, ""Crucio!""


 


The Not-Charlie convulsed on the floor. Blaise couldn't understand what was happening, but he would not let Bellatrix do this no matter who was in that body. 


 


He strode forward almost in between Bellatrix and her captive, willing himself to look calm and casual, ""Madam Lestrange. You called for me.""


 


As she let up the spell, he stepped fully in front of the person on the floor. Bellatrix didn't seem to notice. 


 


""I need a potion to make her act like him!"" Bellatrix cried. ""

You

 know what my good boy is like. But she... She's ruining it.""


 


""I told you she wouldn't cooperate unless you kept her imperiused,"" snarled someone from the other side of the room. Blaise hadn't even noticed that Rowle was there. 


 


Tonks. This was Tonks they had forced to assume Charlie's body and take the punishment Bellatrix wanted to give him. Blaise felt faint. It took every ounce of willpower he had to say, ""Madam Lestrange, I'm afraid I don't have any potions that will..."" 


 


""What good are you then!?"" she screamed, ""

Crucio.

"" 


 


Blaise felt like a thousand blades were slicing him inside. It was worse than any 

crucio

 he had experienced before, fueled by whatever sticky ichor that Bellatrix could call emotions. The pain was excruciating and he couldn't get enough air to even scream. It felt like it would never end, but suddenly Rowle was knocking Bellatrix away from him and the spell finally stopped. 


 


Blaise lay on the floor panting and shaking. Tonks, in her own body again, lay a few feet away, staring at him like she hoped he would get some sort of message from her eyes.


 


""He's the only bloody healer we have, Bella! I don't like him either, but we need him,"" Rowle shouted at her.


 


She huffed, ""Bollocks. We could go kidnap another. They might even have a useful potion for me.""


 


Rowle shook his head. ""They don't make potions that will make a bitch behave. That's what the Imperius is for. What kind of witch are you that you can't hold it?""


 


""She threw it off!"" The sound of Bellatrix's voice was so shrill it hurt Blaise's ears. Or maybe they just hurt anyway. He couldn't tell. 


 


Tonks was still watching him and it was making him feel guilty for just laying here. She needed a healer, needed him. He tried to pull his body up and move toward her.


 


""Bitch hasn't moved in days. Won't even eat. You're bloody insane if you think she was strong enough to throw off an Imperius,"" Rowle said.


 


""I am telling you, she..."" Bellatrix stopped speaking as she looked at the person she had pointed at and realized that Tonks was herself again. The sound Bellatrix made wasn't even human. All her rage was back on Tonks. ""You stupid, mud-blooded whore. Give him back! Give him to me or die!""


 


Rowle spoke up, ""That's 

my

 pet, Bellatrix, and you haven't even paid me for using her yet.""


 


""She isn't him! You promised me 

him

, not the werewolf's whore! All she had to do was be my good boy. But she wasn't and I won't pay for that. But 

she 

will,"" Bellatrix argued. 


 


""You should have kept a better eye on your property Bella,"" Rowle said with a smug grin, ""Unlike you, I take care of my things."" He started toward his pet.


 


Bellatrix snarled at him, then spun, her wand trained on Tonks. ""

In Medio Ignus

!"" she cried. The spell streaked across the room. Blaise didn't even think, just pushed himself to his feet, standing up in the way of the spell. Bellatrix was not going to kill Tonks while he was there. He heard Tonks gasp behind him just as the spell hit.


 


If the 

crucio

 had been excruciating, this was shattering. He felt like his body was on fire from the inside out. This time he could scream, and did. 


 


""Now you've done it, you crazy bitch"" Rowle shouted. ""Fix him before the Dark Lord kills us for killing the healer.""


 


Bellatrix grumbled, ""He shouldn't have gotten in the way.""


 


""He's delirious from the 

crucio

. Counterspell! Now!"" Rowle commanded.


 


""

Frigus Interius

!"" Bellatrix walked closer. Blaise was on the ground gasping and crying. She nudged him with the toe of her boot. ""Bad timing healer boy, my mistake. But don't worry, this time I'm killing the little bitch.""


 


""No, you're not,"" Rowle said. He stepped in front of Bellatrix, yanked Tonks up with one arm, and tossed her over his shoulder. ""You've fucking broken her and now I can't even get the healer to fix her up because 

he

 needs a fucking healer.""


 


""He'll figure it out,"" Bellatrix replied with a shrug. ""But 

you

 won't if you don't put her down and make her give me my pet back."" She had her wand solidly aimed at Rowle now. 


 


""Keep pointing that at me and I'll snap it,"" he said angrily. 


 


""I'm not paying unless I get to kill her or get my pet back,"" Bellatrix pouted.


 


""Then I'll find some other way to get what you owe me,"" Rowle turned and stormed out.


 


Bellatrix screeched and started destroying the room, shooting 

bombarda

s and 

confrigo

s at everything. Blaise wanted, needed, to get out, but he couldn't move. The pain was still so intense. Noticing him again, Bellatrix began kicking him - in the stomach, the ribs, the face, everywhere she could get to.


 


""Don't come to my room again unless you can do something useful!"" she screamed, opening the servant's door and magically throwing him into the hall beyond before slamming the door.








Blaise wasn't sure how long he lay there, trying to breathe, trying to will himself to move. When he finally managed to push himself off the floor, he could still only crawl to the wall, pulling himself up a little at a time. Every breath burnt. She had countered the spell, but not the damage it had already done. His head was spinning and he wasn't sure what potions or spells he would even use to heal himself. If he could at all.


 


Hours passed and he was still trying to pull himself along. He had maneuvered down a staircase without falling, but his legs wouldn't carry him any further. He still had most of this floor to cross before he would be in the infirmary, but his body was failing. Blaise was perilously close to passing out when a little mouse ran right up to him. 


 


He was sure he was seeing things. There was a keening sound that he vaguely realized must be himself. Blaise could barely keep his eyes open, but what he saw didn't make sense anyway. The mouse had become a man. Panic washed through him, not knowing what this new person might do to him. He thought there was a flash of red above him as his body crumpled into the man's hold. His sluggish brain finally put the pieces together.


 



Charlie.



 


Blaise was aware of a warm chest and strong arms for only a second before the black took him.








No trigger warnings today! Happy April Fools Day! Had I thought of it before this moment, I might have slipped in a George POV in honor of his birthday, but *shrug* I love where we're at for this chapter. Enjoy and let me know what you think!

Side note: Fun prank to pull on your kids - bake something absolutely delicious that you would never ever allow them to have for breakfast. Grin a lot as you tell them they can have all they want. Feed a piece to another adult and have them make a bad face before grinning and also telling them it's wonderful and that they should go ahead. Eat it right in front of them. No matter how much you assure them it's great and not a prank at all, they will have nothing to do with it.

Thank you, omnenomnom and highlyintelligentblonde for being an awesome alpha and beta, respectively.

I still don't own anything to do with Harry Potter.

Saturday, May 30th; around 1 am


 


Exhaustion and relief warred in Charlie's veins as he collapsed on the bed next to Blaise. The last five hours had been so intense that he just wanted to curl into a ball around Blaise and cry. But he was okay now. He was going to be okay. 


 


There were no potions made that would heal the internal damage Blaise had sustained. Without the knowledge of burn spells that Charlie had acquired over the years of working with dragons, they both knew that Blaise would be gone now. But that still hadn't been enough. Repairing the damage to his organs had required Blaise's active instructions - awake and without pain potion so he didn't get groggy. Charlie had to silence the room so no one could hear Blaise scream. 


 


No one except him. Charlie couldn't stop shaking now that the danger was past. Well, the danger of Blaise dying from Bellatrix's curse. There were so many other things that could go wrong, so many other dangers that could destroy them. He tried to take deep breaths and calm down, but it wasn't working. As his breathing worked up, Blaise turned toward him on the bed.


 


""Char,"" he began, his voice strained from the fire's wrath on his throat, ""I'll be okay, promise. Just rest.""


 


""Can't,"" he whispered, too exhausted to speak any louder. ""Still so much. Need to check on Draco, start some potions, check on you, then... hide."" If he could focus on what to do instead of all the things he couldn't control, he might be able to cope without falling apart.


 


Blaise reached over to him, grasped Charlie's hand in his, and pulled him closer. As their bodies collided, Charlie's attempts to keep himself under control failed. A sob escaped as his arms came around Blaise and crushed him gently into his chest. ""Blaise... I thought I lost you. I thought... I just... I can't... Merlin please, Blaise, please don't go.""


 


""Hey, I'm not going anywhere,"" Blaise whispered to him, letting his own arms surround Charlie as he cried. ""I made it thanks to you. I'm going to be okay. 

We

 are going to be okay.""


 


""You can't know that,"" Charlie said, his words almost a whimper as he clutched at the other man. 


 


Blaise sighed and put his forehead against Charlie's. ""We're okay for this round and we know we're going to do everything we can to protect each other next time and all the times after.""


 


Charlie's fists clenched. ""I can't do anything to protect you,"" he said, shaking with the fear and frustration he was barely holding back, ""What happened, Blaise? I know it was Bellatrix, but how-?""


 


Blaise sighed and ran his long fingers through Charlie's wavy curls. Charlie could tell the other man really didn't want to answer and was weighing his words. ""I took the curse she meant for someone else,"" he admitted.


 


""Why would you do that?"" Charlie demanded, his tears slowing as his body tensed with anger.


 


""As if you wouldn't jump in front of a curse for a bunny rabbit if you were in the right place at that moment,"" Blaise scoffed.


 


The tension drained out and Charlie half laughed, ""We're not talking about me."" He stared seriously into Blaise's eyes until he bit his lip and sighed.


 


""It was meant for Tonks,"" Blaise admitted. ""And she was already in bad shape.""


 


Charlie pulled back, eyes wide, ""Merlin, please tell me they didn't give her to Bellatrix after I left.""


 


""She still belongs to Rowle,"" Blaise said, but Charlie could see there was something he wasn't saying.


 


""But Bellatrix had her today,"" Charlie stated, waiting for Blaise to go on. He had a sick feeling in his stomach, a dread that he already knew why Bellatrix would be having a go at Tonks - at the one person who could easily morph to look like someone else. The silence that dragged out between them didn't help.


 


""Please don't make me tell you,"" Blaise finally said softly. ""It won't help. I did what I could. Maybe tomorrow I can make my rounds and heal what was done to her when she wouldn't play along.""


 


Charlie closed his eyes for a moment as he tried to deal with the knowledge that this was because of him. He shook his head as he pulled Blaise tighter against himself. ""No way are you getting out of this bed that soon.""


 


""People need me, Charlie. I can't just lay here.""


 


""I need you, too,"" Charlie whispered, eyes downcast, ""and other people will benefit more from you if you're well before you try to help them.""


 


Blaise ran a hand down Charlie's cheek. Charlie noticed the hand was shaking just a little as it drew his chin up so that their eyes met. ""I want to be here for you, Charlie. I will do..."" his breath hitched, ""anything I have to do to keep you safe, but I can't let the others down. There are women who will get pregnant without the potions I make them, people whose injuries can be deadly within a day of not getting treated, children who-""


 


""There are 

children

 in this place?"" Charlie couldn't control the horror in his voice.


 


A sad nod was the only answer for a few moments. Finally, Blaise spoke again. ""I will rest today but I can't let them down again tomorrow.""


 


Charlie didn't argue this time, but he did pull away. The terrible exhaustion that pulled at him was dissipating in the face of everything this meant. He could see sadness seep back into Blaise's eyes as he moved, but he couldn't do it, couldn't take the offered comfort any longer when he knew that it would only hurt them both more if something terrible did happen. Taking a deep breath, Charlie closed his eyes and thought for a moment. 


 


When he opened them again, it was with determination. ""I need to check on Draco. I didn't have much time to look him over, but I think he was drained again.""


 


Blaise nodded. ""Yes. Merlin, was that just earlier today?""


 


""What happened?"" Charlie asked, surprised when Blaise started to chuckle.


 


""Hermione,"" Blaise replied as though that were the answer in and of itself.


 


""Granger?"" 


 


""Yes. Shite. I forgot we've never talked about..."" Blaise trailed off, biting his lip as he stared at Charlie, wondering how well he knew the girl in question. The Weasleys were known to be close family friends of hers, but the dragon tamer wasn't always caught up with the rest of them, he had found.


 


""What haven't we talked about?"" Charlie prompted.


 


""The bond that drains Draco. It's a, well, a marriage bond,"" Blaise started to explain.


 


Charlie got a look on his face that didn't bode well. ""With Hermione, I assume. I don't like where this is going,"" he stated, ""but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt until I hear the whole story. He's obviously not having a grand old time of it, however the bond came about.""


 


Blaise told the story, the whole thing, including that first, horrible night, after swearing Charlie to secrecy about it. It was horrifying, but... Charlie knew Blaise and Draco well enough by now to believe that they had truly done the best they could with yet another shitty situation they had been thrust into. 


 


""So what does this have to do with today?"" Charlie was finally able to ask.


 


""There was an attack today. Before the situation with Bellatrix arose, I had been on my way to check Drake. The description the first couple of men who needed help gave... I could just tell it was Hermione they had tried to take. Not that they had any luck. She kicked their arses. Then the rest of the men sent out had to be helped because the Dark Lord punished them for not recapturing 'the Mudblood.' There's only one person who's referred to with such distinction. Hermione is with the Order again. We couldn't be sure until now.""


 


Charlie felt relief rush through him. She was safe, or as safe as any of them could be. He didn't know the girl well since she was essentially just his little brother's friend, but he knew how important she was and of course wouldn't have wanted anything to happen to her even if she weren't. ""Was there anyone else hurt?"" he asked.


 


""Not anyone from your side,"" Blaise assured.


 


""Our side,"" Charlie corrected as he slid off the bed and began gathering things he might need from the various healer supplies laying around.


 


Blaise stared up at him. ""What?""


 


""I said, no one got hurt from our side. Yours, mine, Hermione's, Draco's. I'm sure that prat won't admit to it anytime soon, but you two don't belong to the dark. You know it and I know it. And I'll make damn sure the rest of them know it when we all get out of here."" The look in Charlie's eyes was fire. 


 


""Charlie, we're not all-""


 


""Why don't you tell me about the rest of the patients you have to tend to tomorrow?"" Charlie asked, as he dosed Blaise with a pain potion. Blaise looked like he might protest the subject change, but apparently decided not to fight it. He started talking about each of the different people and what they needed and where they were located as Charlie asked detailed questions. If he had been more aware, Blaise might have noticed the copious notes Charlie was taking. When they had finally exhausted what seemed like every room in the manor, Charlie slipped him a second potion, sending him straight to sleep.


 


He then dragged his own tired body up and stumbled out of the Healer's room, focusing his attention on Draco. Charlie cast an 

ennervate

 and then waited while Draco sputtered and came awake. 


 


""She did it again,"" the blond said, his voice drowsy. Squinting at Charlie, he asked, ""Where's Blaise?""


 


""Bellatrix cursed him,"" Charlie explained, holding Draco down to the bed when he started trying to scramble out of it. ""He's okay, but resting. I'm the Healer for now.""


 


""Going to polyjuice yourself?"" Draco asked, his voice a bit taunting. When he was this out of it, Charlie had noticed he slid more easily into the schoolyard bully role he had heard about before getting to know the boy.


 


""Not until tomorrow,"" Charlie told him, ""You're the only one seeing me tonight. Now, did you want to hear the story about what Hermione did while I look you over?""


 


Draco listened avidly as Charlie checked his diagnostics and told the story. Charlie laughed when Draco smiled and insisted he had known Hermione would get there and ""be the badarse she always is."" Dear Merlin, he was high on the potions. Sighing, Charlie said, ""It would be better if you could learn to control how much magic you send her, even if she 

is

 able to do damned impressive displays when she has it all.""


 


Draco shook his head. ""Don't send anything. It's just gone when she needs it. Never know it's coming,"" he slurred.


 


That was odd. Charlie was sure Blaise said Hermione sent her magic to Draco because he needed it. Of course it would work the same way back, wouldn't it? Perhaps he hadn't explained it quite right. Or Draco was too high to know what he was saying. It could be behaving differently with the two of them so far apart. Or maybe he had just gotten the story wrong. Charlie gave a mental shrug and administered the last potion, a sleeping draught, before stepping away.


 


He needed to get into his hiding place and sleep as best he could. He was certainly exhausted enough to manage it even standing. Tomorrow was going to be a long, busy, and very dangerous day. 







****************************************







The rose garden again. Draco felt a rush of elation. She was with the Order and safe! He could let her know how happy he was about that. He could... Would he even see her? Maybe his subconscious had gotten over its anger at his behavior and would let him see Hermione again, but what if it didn't? He needed to see her. Please, he begged... himself? Merlin, he was an idiot. 


 


It didn't stop him from rushing through the winding paths with the hope of finding her at the fountain. When he heard the splashing up ahead, he thought to slow down and look more dignified, but decided he didn't care. It didn't fucking 

matter

 that he might look excited to see a figment of his imagination.


 


Bursting out into the area with his heart on his sleeve was a lot harder to handle, however, when she wasn't there and a tidal wave of disappointment hit him.


 


He paced. He threw rocks into the water. He stomped around scaring the few creatures that tried to come to the fountain. By the time there was a rustle in the pathway she often came from, he had worked himself up into a state.


 


""Where the hell have you been?"" he raged as soon as he saw her. 


 


Hermione looked immediately taken aback. In fact, he was suddenly sure she was going to turn and go back into her pathway. There was no way Draco was letting that happen.


 


He was around the fountain and across the clearing before she could make her move to leave. Draco honestly wasn't sure what he planned to do - shake her maybe, until she gave him the answers he needed. It surprised him nearly as much as it did her when he grabbed her by the upper arms and yanked her to his chest, his lips crashing down onto hers before either of them could say a word. 


 


Whatever part of his brain had concocted this plan undoubtedly meant for him to break it off after a moment and demand she explain herself better than she had last time. It must have assumed that he would startle her into telling him things. It probably did not think that he would moan and get his hands caught in the curly hair that smelled so good and become so hard he couldn't think straight. That part of his brain almost assuredly did not expect her to attack him with just as much vigor, nipping and sucking at his lips and neck and ears in the moments when their tongues weren't dueling. It was likely not expecting him to continue snogging her until she let him pick her up, her legs wrapping around his waist as her pelvis pressed against him and her core, so wet he could feel it through his trousers, rubbed against his throbbing cock. 


 


He pulled away for air, his eyes instantly snapping to her reddened lips and flushed cheeks. 

Alive.

 She was alive and safe.


 


""You're okay. Thank Merlin,"" he muttered, leaning his forehead against hers for just a moment while he felt a deep tension he had been unaware of lift from his shoulders. ""You're okay.""


 


""Malfoy?"" she hummed, more than a bit breathless. He was inordinately pleased to hear the edge of desire in her tone.


 


""I don't know why I care,"" he said, running a hand down her cheek. ""But you're okay. You're safe.""


 


""I-,"" 


 


He cut off whatever infuriating thing she was about to say with another searing kiss, bathing in the feeling of her body against his. The relief was dizziness and he could practically feel his magic mending.


 


Draco carried her to the fountain and laid her out before him. She stared up at him with lust and something deeper in her amber eyes. Draco felt an urge to ask her what that look meant, deep down, but he couldn't bring himself to waste breath on a question when he could have some part of her under his lips instead. He didn't want to acknowledge whatever his subconscious was trying to push him toward anyway.


 


He slowly lowered his body on top of hers. Hermione moaned as she rubbed against him, rolling her hips so that she was grinding his cock with her body. He propped himself on his elbows, leaning away just enough that he could open the buttons on the top part of her shirt, delighted to find no bra in his way, and wrap his lips around one hardened nipple. 


 


Then there was no one there, no trace of her, as though she had never been with him at all. Draco screamed in helpless frustration and need. And an overwhelming sadness he had no idea what to do with. 


 


******************************


 


When her eyes popped open, Hermione took in the room around her quickly, trying to come to terms with what might be happening. One moment she was in a familiar rose garden in a moment that was surreal but undeniably arousing. Now she was in a silent room she had never seen before, decorated almost entirely in shades of yellow. Her first frantic thought was that it had happened again - the obliviation, the not knowing what had happened, where she was. A deep breath calmed her enough to think. The rose garden was just a dream. Before that... the floo! Bill and Fleur! A portkey. 


 


She looked around to more accurately assess where she might be. From where she lay on the bed, she could see a table covered in potion bottles, one of them knocked over and in pieces - undoubtedly the catalyst for her quick awakening. Beyond the table, there was a beautiful old dresser, and a window with gauzy yellow curtains moving in the gusty breeze. This wasn't a place she had been in before. 


 


She realized she could hear people shouting through the window. They were pleasant shouts, and she knew exactly why when her brain began to filter through the noise and caught the words ""quaffle"" and ""chaser"" and ""snitch."" 


 


She took these things in very quickly and determined she was somewhere safe even if she didn't necessarily know where that might be. She was just debating whether to roll over and try to get back to that dream that had been cut maddeningly short or to sit up and see where she was when she felt a hand on her shoulder.


 


""Mione?"" questioned a familiar voice.


 


""HARRY!"" she cried, practically throwing herself out of the bed into a hug with her best friend, who had been sitting in a chair pulled up to the other side. They clung to one another as words came tumbling from each of them.


 


""I've been so worried, Harry! I didn't know if you were even alive for so long!""


 


""I can say the same about you,"" he answered quietly, squeezing her just a little harder. ""Then when they said you were back but I couldn't see you...it's been hard. And then you were here, but you just appeared on the ground unconscious. What happened, Hermione?""


 


She opened her mouth to explain when they were interrupted by a rather amused voice. 


 


""I see you followed my directions quite well,"" said an older woman standing in the door of the room. Seeing her was heart stopping at first, as she so resembled her sister Bellatrix, but the laugh lines on her face and sanity in her intelligent eyes quickly proved she was someone else.


 


Harry startled in a guilty way. ""I'm sorry, Dromeda. She just woke up! I would have come to you once we said hello,"" he insisted sheepishly.


 


""Please help her back to laying down, Harry. Remember what I said.""


 


Nodding, he untangled their arms from one another and half picked her up to get her back on the bed. Hermione immediately began fighting to sit up again. ""I feel fine,"" she said, though she had to admit that her head was spinning a tiny bit, but this was by far the best she had felt in weeks, maybe months.


 


""Rest, child. There's no need for you to be up and about yet,"" Andromeda soothed. She pulled out a number of potions and handed them to her. ""Strengthening and pain potions of various sorts. Bringing your magical core back can be painful and exhausting, even without your condition, though I must admit I'm surprised by how much it has improved with your rest. Some of those potions are the things Madam Pomfrey had already given you, as well.""


 


She grimaced, but dutifully took all of the potions. When the last one was down, she asked, ""May I get up now?""


 


Andromeda rolled her eyes. ""No. I'm quite sure I'm speaking clearly. You are not to get out of that bed until I instruct you to. If I can trust you to follow that instruction, I will leave the two of you in here to catch up without an audience. Are you to be trusted?""


 


""Yes ma'am,"" Hermione answered. Harry was nodding emphatically as well.


 


""Very well,"" she said, and headed for the door. ""I will be nearby if you need anything. I'll be back soon, too, with some soup.""


 


Hermione felt quite enthusiastic about that. She didn't know how long she had been here, but it had already been time to eat when they had flooed to Shell Cottage. She was starving, but not even that could rival her need to know everything Harry had been through.


 


The two friends talked so fast they were practically tripping over each other, trying to get everything out. They each had a period of time they weren't aware of after the battle, but so much had happened since then. Harry told her how he and Ginny had gotten back together, though with a lot of blushing, stammering, and shying away from actual details - for which Hermione was grateful. She knew she would hear it all from Ginny eventually, but that just wasn't something she and Harry discussed with each other. He explained about the raid on the training camp and why he had been banished from fighting or from even being at Hogwarts. His eyes lit up when he talked about the work he had been doing with the newbies here at the mansion. 


 


Hermione shared her strange experience of waking up alone with a house elf that claimed to be hers. Harry laughed hard at that. He didn't laugh when she told him about trying to find work and how hopeless she had felt not knowing what had happened to everyone. The point where she finally saw Bill and George at the meeting place she had designated and the time spent catching up with them was so much better. But then there were harder things to talk about.


 


""How did you come here? What happened?"" Harry asked with an urgency he must have been holding back.


 


""Well, it was after we used the floo to and from Hogwarts,"" she responded.


 


""You've been to Hogwarts? Did you get to see Ron?"" Harry's excitement was palpable. She wasn't sure if he noticed her flinch at Ron's name.


 


""I did,"" she said, and he certainly noticed how strained her voice was that time. She saw him start to ask, so she hurried on, ""When we got to Shell Cottage, there were Death Eaters waiting for us - three of them. Fleur said they had been there all day, since we left. She had barricaded herself in the loo. Bill and I took out those three, but then more started coming through. I think. All I could see was black coming out of the fireplace. Bill and Fleur must have activated the emergency portkeys.""


 


""You were having trouble seeing? Did they hurt you in the fight? I couldn't see any wounds when you arrived. Did Andromeda find something we didn't?"" Harry's eyes were concerned and confused.


 


""I...there's so much to explain that I don't know where to start,"" she said, her heart aching with the fear that he would be angry with her like Ron. Steeling herself, she began, ""I wasn't hurt, per say, just deeply drained, physically and magically. I believe I had overextended myself - past the bounds of my own magic.""


 


""How...""


 


She held up a hand to stall his questions and continued, ""When I woke up in that French villa, I was too busy to notice it for a while, but...I had a magical tie to someone that had never been there before. A bond.""


 


""Who?"" Harry managed.


 


""I didn't know...don't know...who is on the other end. But it seems whoever it is, we can share our magic. I feel him sometimes, when his emotions are strong or when he's...in danger. I've pushed my magic through to him. And when I need it, I feel an overwhelming surge of magic that is his. It's so strong that I don't even really know how to control it. That happened when we were fighting the Death Eaters. I was already drained and needing rest before we flooed to the cottage, so his magic came to me and it blasted a hole in the staircase, knocked out one Death Eater, and flung the other across the room. When I walked toward him, the aura around me was so strong that he was thrown along the floor! I've never even read about power like that...""


 


""Mione, that's incredible!"" Harry spoke with awe. ""But you have no idea who you have this bond with?""


 


She shook her head and bit her lower lip. Harry watched her. She knew he was reading the signs and saw her nerves. Following what was undoubtedly one of the mysterious hunches he often got, he added, ""You refer to the person as 'him' - how do you know the bond is with a man?""


 


Her voice shook as she explained, ""Because it's a marriage bond.""


 


Harry's eyes widened and he sucked in air, but there was no judgement in the look he gave her. ""Are you sure?"" he asked after a moment.


 


She nodded, ""Bill tried to break it, before we knew what it was. It was excruciating. Then Mimsy scolded us and pulled out a book from my beaded bag - one I didn't know was in there. She said before I was obliviated I had been researching the link in there. It's a book all about marriage bonds. It's why I can't trust her. She KNEW I was married all along.""


 


""If she knew that, doesn't she know 

who

 you're married to?""


 


""I assume. But her 'Master' whoever he is or was apparently told her she wasn't allowed to reveal any of that.""


 


""But she says you're her Mistress now?""


 


""Yes,"" Hermione confirmed.


 


""Give her a direct command to tell you.""


 


""I haven't tried since knowing it's a marriage bond, but attempts before that just caused her to hurt herself rather than tell me.""


 


Harry looked as stumped as Hermione felt. Looking at her again, he raised an eyebrow. ""What else?""


 


Hermione felt her face crumpling as tears welled up again. Harry's arms were around her before she could start talking. ""Whatever it is, Hermione, I'm here and I'll help. You're my sister and my best friend. We'll get through it.""


 


She was sobbing as she explained the pregnancy, not knowing who the father was, not even remembering ever having sex. It all poured out of her, then Hermione almost cowered into herself waiting for his response. Harry just hugged her tighter. He was still rubbish at what to say, but through the never-ending camping trip and the horrible weeks without Ron, he had grown enough to know how to offer her comfort.


 


When she calmed, he brushed her wild hair out of her face and said, ""I'm here for you always, and I can't wait to be an uncle.""


 


Hermione gave a watery laugh. ""You'll be the best uncle they could have.""


 


He smiled. ""You know Ron will be here for you, too.""


 


A tight-lipped grimace was all he got in response to that. Harry's brows shot up to his hair. ""Does he know already?""


 


""Yes,"" she whispered. ""He isn't here for me. He is furious, Harry.""


 


""Then he's a wanker. You've done nothing anyone should be angry about.""


 


She clenched him hard in a relieved hug. Andromeda came back in as they clung to each other, Harry rubbing her back. He nodded at the older woman when she gave him a quizzical look. She seemed pleased that he knew what was going on now. 


 


""Well then,"" Andromeda said, heading toward the bed with a heavily laden tray. ""I knew my grandson's godfather wouldn't let us down."" She gave Harry a fond smile as she settled the tray next to Hermione.


 


""Us?"" Hermione echoed, confused. 


 


""Of course. You don't think you're in this alone, do you?"" Andromeda quirked an eyebrow as she smiled at her. Judging from the lines on her face, this was a frequent expression for her. 


 


Hermione felt a sudden wave of relief. Most everyone had assured her it wasn't her fault. Many had said they would help. It was here in this room, however, that she finally felt the truth that she wasn't alone. It was an odd feeling since she had only just met Andromeda, but the woman's motherly regard for her as she moved gracefully around the room felt like family. With her brother next to her, Hermione knew this baby would be loved and accepted no matter what, as would she. 







Thank you, Stella_Lou for reminding me this was an excellent moment for another rose garden meeting.

For this story, this was practically a fluffy chapter. I hope you all enjoyed! No promises of fluff continuing next week, though you never know.

There are no trigger warnings for this one.

I did the unthinkable, folks. I sat down one day and made somewhat of an OUTLINE for the next 40ish chapters, though I'm sure things will start changing as we get further out. They certainly did to this point so far! 

For reference, at 70ish chapters, we will still only be at about the halfway point. If epics aren't your thing (and yet you were somehow still here so far?) you might want to jump ship now. I'm guesstimating this thing will be around 300k+ but I am notoriously bad at underestimating how much I will write.

That said, I have now caught up with myself and no longer have posts ready to go. Well, I had several more chapters, and snippets of them can still be used, but for the most part so much has changed that I'm effectively writing from scratch each chapter now. 

I am now moving to an every other week update schedule rather than weekly. I *might* still put one out on the weekly mark if it happens to come together, but I don't want the story to suffer because I'm trying to push out writing when the muse isn't there.  

My alpha omnenomnom was, as ever, wonderful this week, despite her distress at things the outline revealed (primarily how incredibly loooooooong this thing is). 

I do not own Harry Potter.


Tuesday, June 2nd, 1998


 


""Miss Weasley,"" Severus drawled. For all that he was trying to come across as more approachable, he just couldn't manage to regulate his tone. ""Your assistance is required in the kitchens.""


 


She started to protest and ask questions - of course - but he had already turned on his heel and started for the dungeon. He had spent three ridiculous days of listening to that arrogant moron go on about supposed ownership of the most brilliant girl of their young generation. Three full days of people avoiding the little twerp, but otherwise letting him rant and carry on about things that were in no way his business. Severus Snape refused to put up with another hour of this insanity. 


 


By the time the girl dawdled down to the kitchens to meet him, curiosity on her face, Severus had already gathered his ingredients and was busy dicing and chopping on one of the long counters. She paused at the door, hands on hips, and stared at him working. He bit his tongue to keep from snapping at her. That wouldn't ingratiate the child to him and, while he could come up with this himself, kitchen witchery wasn't his strongest suit. There was the trust issue as well. The little jackarse would never drink something Severus made for him. His sister, though? He might be stupid enough to accept from her, no matter how angry she had been with him. He was a complete dunderhead that way.


 


""You'll want to close your gaping mouth and come over here where you can be useful, Miss Weasley,"" Severus said. He tried not to grind his teeth when she pressed her lips together, flipped her long red hair over her shoulder, and raised an eyebrow.


 


""Why would I want to be useful to you?""


 


Severus closed his eyes and slowly counted to 10 in his head. ""Because, Miss Weasley, if I have to listen to your brother insult the most brilliant student I have ever worked with even one more time, you will be down another brother.""


 


There was a moment where he wasn't sure how she was going to react. He realized she might cry and cursed himself for the thoughtless remark. Then she broke out with a hearty laugh. 


 


""You're right. I do want to be useful."" She began walking toward his counter, but stopped again. ""Only - my name is Ginny. Use it.""


 


Severus went still, his knife halfway through slicing a bowtruckle eye. ""I don't believe it is appropriate for me to refer to...""


 


""You're not my professor,"" she interrupted, ""and I don't let my friends call me 'Miss Weasley'."" Her impression of the way he said her name, drawl and all, was spot on. It made his cheeks tinge pink and his sharp mouth open to put her back in her place.


 


When he looked up, however, she wasn't paying any attention to him, rummaging through the ingredients he had brought and glancing at his hastily scrawled notes. Before he could speak, she asked, ""I see what we're trying to do, but what exactly are we making here?"" The look she gave him made it very clear that the discussion of her name was closed and they had more important things to work out. Grudgingly, he had to agree.


 


*****************************


 


Ron paced back and forth angrily, staring at the cup in his hand. He had utterly missed the look of triumph on his sister's face as he snatched it from her. Nor had he noticed her rush around the corner to where a greasy old git was astounded by the stupidity and pride.


 


Ron was shocked that Ginny had even spoken to him. That she had made him something as well told him she was ready to admit he was right. He took a sip. Pretty soon everyone would realize Hermione had screwed him over and they would come apologize to him, he thought happily. It was only a matter of time.


 


Another sip. Odd, he thought, feeling his anger ebb away at the delicious treat. A mint milkshake - with chocolate chip slices, even if he felt like they were looking at him - was kind of an odd way to say she forgave him. Wait. Forgave his bad behavior? Was that what had happened? Yes, of course. Ginny had forgiven him and he could only hope the others would, too. He was really lonely the last few days. He took another gulp of the drink.


 


Really, the loneliness was his own fault. He absolutely deserved it. His family members hadn't spoken to him in days until Ginny reached out. Even interactions with Kingsley and Professor McGonagall were stilted. 


 


Ron took another sip before suddenly stopping mid-stride. What had he done!? He owed Hermione a huge apology. He should go to her right now!


 


It took a couple of calming breaths for him to realize he didn't know where she was. And after the way he had acted, no one was going to tell him either. Not that there would be any way to communicate with her even if he knew.


 


For her own safety, he would have needed to stay away from her even if things between them had been anything like what he imagined before seeing her again. Having two members of the ""Golden Trio"" together would be dangerous if the Death Eaters found out. She had already been attacked once since returning. He knew that much about her. It terrified him that something horrible might have happened to her when they were right in the middle of a fight and he hadn't been able to apologize yet.


 


It had just been such a shock, he thought. They were supposed to be together. She was his happily ever after. That wasn't supposed to include someone else's kid, or a marriage bond with a Death Eater, even if she could get around it, as George and Ginny had pointed out to him when they were still trying to reason with him. 


 


The thing was, he still had these feelings for her. His best hope was that, when he could contact her, she would accept his apology and they could move on together like they were supposed to. She belonged with him and he couldn't wait to have her by his side, even pregnant and falsely married.


 


For now, he was supposed to be working on mission assignments and plans for raids. It was still considered a top priority to get into Malfoy Manor and it still felt completely impossible. The blood wards were insurmountable without someone in the family. If the reports the spy sent were true, there was only one person alive who could get through those wards without them being purposefully dropped. That git had disappeared. Probably too busy sucking up to his Master Voldy, Ron thought. Malfoy hadn't been seen out on a raid since the reported murder of his father.  Sometimes Ron wondered if the Death Eaters had quietly killed him, too.


 


He shook his head to focus, taking another sip of his drink as he sat down at his planning desk. Several muggleborn and half-blood families had requested assistance hiding their muggle families. That took a team for each extraction. Coordinating those had been Remus' job. Ron felt a deep pang in his chest and shied away from the line of thought that brought up. Maybe Professor McGonagall could find some time to help him with relocation homes. If not, there was surely someone he could assign that task to. One of the girls, maybe. They were good at that sort of thing. Susan Bones. Yeah, she would be perfect.


 


He needed to keep some people with their ears to the ground in Diagon and Knockturn Alleys. There were also a number of muggle areas that needed to be watched. The Order couldn't keep every place safe, but they knew the ones Voldy had wanted to attack in the past, and the ones he was most likely to go for next. He had once stuck to small attacks, but as his power grew, the bastard gleefully targeted larger tourist areas. 


 


Ron drained the last of his peace offering from Ginny, shivering at the sense of cooling that came over him. Puzzled, he looked down into the cup. There was one chocolate chip left. As he scooped it out with his finger he took a good look. It was definitely staring at him. Ginny was a clever little bitch these days. And he was grateful for it, even if he wasn't about to tell her so. 


 


***************


 


Tonks lay broken in the corner Rowle had kept her in since the full moon. She didn't dare identify the night any other way lest her mind slip back into the cloud of grief it so frequently disappeared into. The pain she was in kept her out of it for the most part, but she could still spiral. Tonks had become accustomed to Rowle using her then throwing her back down, no matter how much she had stopped responding. 


 


The last three days, though, he hadn't done a thing to hurt her. Since the incident with Bellatrix, he was worried. If Tonks had the energy or cared enough about life to consider taking advantage of his generosity in any way, this would probably have been her best chance. 


 


Of course, she apparently still cared about some things. She hadn't gone along with that deranged lunatic. She shuddered to think what Bellatrix had actually been doing to her old friend for 

that

 to be what she wanted to play out. Tonks had to admit it made her curious what he would have done - what he 

had

 done to survive and to gain the opportunity to escape. She knew Charlie too well to think that someone had just stolen him away.


 


Another puzzle that kept her mind spinning was the Healer. She knew the ""improved"" 

crucio

 Bellatrix was using could be harsh, but she had also seen his eyes and knew he had taken that spell for her quite purposefully. What was he playing at? Did the boy have a death wish?


 


From what she had overheard, the entire Manor was buzzing with irritation that their Healer had been harmed. Bellatrix was being punished. Not that it did Tonks any good. Rowle had actually done some rudimentary healing on her. He wasn't very good at it, but she wasn't bleeding out. Her arm was broken and he seemed distressed that he couldn't fix it, but not enough that he had asked anyone else to try. Tonks hoped Blaise returned soon. 


 


Rowle would request him once he was known to be well again, but she hoped he slipped in sooner. If her ""owner"" hadn't been so concerned about her, she would likely be pregnant by now. Every day without the contraception potion was terrifying.


 


Tonks played with the ends of her leash. Usually Rowle didn't make her wear it in his rooms but he hadn't bothered to take it off when they returned from Bellatrix's chambers and she couldn't get rid of it herself. There was no reason for it to be on right now, the wards wouldn't let her out. He also truly believed they wouldn't let anyone in. In his defense, that probably would have been true if the wards on the house itself hadn't been keyed to always let the healer's runic symbol, embroidered on all healers' robes with magical thread, through. 


 


It was an old working - something some Malfoy ancestor had deemed necessary and bound with old magic. That was her theory anyway. She doubted the current Malfoys - well, the last one - had ever thought about it or were consciously aware of it. Healers came when they called and were able to get wherever they needed to be. It would have been too important to notice or care. Out in the open was the best way to hide things, Tonks thought. It had even taken her a while to notice it was an oddity. She hadn't mentioned it to Zabini.


 


Despite her physical pain and emotional lethargy, her auror training was forcing her mind to continue cataloguing information. If there were ever a chance to get out, she would have as much knowledge as possible at hand - assuming they didn't obliviate her again. It seemed, though, that Rowle very much wanted her to remember that her beloved Remus was gone. He wanted her to know he had done it himself, so that he could own her completely. Of course, he hadn't replaced the baby yet, he would tell her. But he had people looking for the werewolf pup and he would purge it soon enough. 


 


Teddy. Her baby boy, hopefully safe with her mother, was the only thing that kept her from ending things herself. She wanted to be with Remus again, but she wanted to be with her son to watch him grow, too, to see him become a man Remus would have been proud of. She was glad that she at least had him to think about while she lay there alone on the floor.


 


Tonks tensed when she suddenly heard the servant's door opening. Of course Rowle would never come from there, and she was fairly certain that no one besides a healer could come across the wards anyway, but she heard Moody's voice in her head. Constant Vigilance! Her body curled in on itself automatically, the only protection she could manage.


 


""Tonks,"" a low voice called softly. It didn't quite roll over her like the balm Zabini's voice usually was. She started to move from the corner, sliding carefully, painfully up the wall, when she saw Zabini stride into the room and lost her footing in surprise. 


 


He moved with confidence, a strong man, brave and certain... but with none of the subtlety that the Healer actually moved with. 


 


""Who are you?"" she demanded, cursing internally that her voice was shaking from the pain and from a sudden explosion of fear. As a metamorphmagus, she was quite familiar with taking other forms but rarely faced the situation herself. 


 


He spun to her corner and she could see that the bag he had slung over his shoulder was filled with potions. It was written all over his face how upset he was when he saw her in a heap on the floor. His hands came up in a surrendering gesture. ""I'm Healer Zabini. Is your head bothering you? I'm just here to check you and give you your potions. I'm sorry I've been gone a few days.""


 


Tonks didn't protest as he walked closer, though she was watching whoever they were warily. There was something familiar about the person, beyond the face they wore. Her mind was shifting through questions and information, trying to assess what she knew.


 


He knelt to the ground in front of her as he cast a diagnostic. At a glance she knew it wasn't as advanced as the ones Zabini commonly used. ""Are you any good at healing?""


 


""Well I 

am

 the healer,"" he replied, his voice just the tiniest bit testy. 


 


""Zabini is the healer. I don't know who you are, but you're not him.""


 


The doppelganger huffed in irritation. Tonks felt her eyes go wide. Even with the voice disguised, she knew that huff and the way his eyes squinted as he did it. 


 


""Charlie?"" she asked in disbelief.


 


His head jerked up to look in her eyes, a moment of trepidation before he gave a familiar lopsided grin. ""How the bloody hell did you know, Dora?"" he asked, dropping the voice modification spell.


 


Forgetting the pain in her body, Tonks flung herself into his arms. She was moving too quickly to react when he flinched at her touch before relaxing into it. With her ear pressed against his chest, she could feel how fast his heart was pounding. She knew better than to take it personally, not after what they had been through. She was just glad he adjusted fairly quickly. It was odd to experience Charlie, her best childhood friend, in someone else's body. She said as much and he laughed.


 


""Now you finally know what it's like!"" he pointed out.


 


She grinned at him for a moment, her hair turning pink for the first time since the full moon. ""Merlin, I can't believe you're here right now!"" she practically gushed. Tonks wasn't the gushy type, but... reality hit hard as she thought about it. ""Charlie, what 

are

 you doing here?"" 


 


He bit his lower lip for a moment, before launching into a rant as he prodded her here and there, performing healing spells as he talked. ""Blaise is still recovering. I think he'll be able to come on his rounds tomorrow, but people couldn't wait. There are so fucking many people he's taking care of. I'm sorry I couldn't get to you any sooner. I've tried every day, but Rowle's been lurking and I've had to be careful. I know you're more observant than most, but I can't be caught again. I...""


 


His voice failed and Tonks wondered what could have him so upset. His eyes met hers, unshed tears there. ""Blaise told me what happened, Dora. I'm so fucking sorry that psychotic bitch did this because of me.""


 


""Have you gone barmy?"" she asked him, with a gasp in the middle as he healed the bone in her arm. 


 


""What?"" he asked, somewhat absentmindedly. He had clearly gotten better over the years, but Tonks knew healing wasn't a natural gift for Charlie unless you were an animal of some sort. His concentration meant he was distracted from their conversation. 


 


She shook her head at him. ""Don't you dare blame yourself for what she did! Char, I can't imagine what she did to you... if that was a taste of it...""


 


He looked away. ""It doesn't matter now. I'm not going back. And I swear, Dora, I'm going to get you out of here, too.""


 


She felt her heart soften for a second before steeling herself. ""Don't be stupid. Get out! Now, before you get caught!"" she insisted. She could tell by the set of his jaw that it was pointless, but she had to try. 


 


""You know I'm not going to do that. When I first got out, I planned to break you out and go, but... it's more than that now. Dora, these people Blaise helps... There are captives like us. But there are also the pureblood wives who are kept in these same conditions. There are... there are children here, being held ransom for their parents' cooperation or some just... because those sick bastards..."" He couldn't even finish the thought. There was fury burning in his eyes. 


 


Tonks would have liked to have been surprised, but nothing the Death Eaters did surprised her anymore. ""Charlie, it's horrible, but... what can we do?""


 


He smiled at her use of we. ""First we'll have to get you out, and I haven't figured out how to do it yet. There's a lot that I haven't figured out, but I will take a wizard's oath that I'm not leaving this fucking Manor until everyone who needs help is out.""


 


""That's a 

lot

 of people.""


 


""I know. But I have some plans ready to put in place. And we have inside help. We'll come up with something, whether it's trickling people out or a mass breakout. Just have to figure out the damn wards.""


 


She could see the worry in his eyes, warring with determination. Charlie had always been too stubborn for his own good. If he said he was going to get them out, he was going to see it through. Arguing was a waste of breath. She might as well focus on more immediate questions. ""You still haven't explained to me what you're doing here.""


 


""I told you,"" he started, ""Blaise-""


 


""Yes, I heard that. But how are you the person taking over for him? And how did he become 'Blaise' for you instead of 'Healer Zabini'?""


 


Tonks was intrigued to see Charlie blush. 

That

 was interesting.


 


""Does your occlumency hold against the Dark Lord? It's not just my life that depends on it,"" he told her. His eyes were so serious as he stared at her, not a look she had ever seen from her laid-back friend.


 


""It does,"" she said solemnly. ""They're convinced I know nothing. I think they've forgotten entirely that I'm an auror.""


 


Charlie nodded and sat down on the floor beside her, thinking about his answer, it appeared. ""I literally ran into Blaise in the servant's hall as I was escaping. He and Draco have hidden me and-""


 


""Draco? Malfoy? He's in a coma.""


 


""He's safest if everyone thinks he's in a coma,"" Charlie corrected. He went on, his tone surprisingly fond when he said, ""The little punk still thinks he's better than me. He's getting over it - getting over a lot of things. I'm fucking proud of him.""


 


Tonks was momentarily stunned. She knew very little about Draco Malfoy beyond the fact that he was raised to be the worst kind of pureblood and was a terrible bully because of it. But then she thought of the things she had personally seen him go through. Remembering how horrified she had been for the boy the night he had killed his father, Tonks nodded to Charlie. 


 


""I'm glad he is changing for the better,"" she said diplomatically.


 


""They're on our side, Dora. And I'm not leaving here without them either.""


 


Her eyes widened. ""I don't know if the Order will so readily accept them considering-""


 


""I will take an Unbreakable Vow for them if that's what it takes,"" he said, ""The Order will have to get over themselves.""


 


""They still might not-""


 


""Then I'll leave,"" Charlie said with a determined grimace and a shrug, the subject closed. ""Now, how are you holding up? Aside from what Bellatrix did.""


 


Now it was her turn to look away. ""He's gone, Charlie."" She choked on a sob. ""We wasted so much time with him insisting he was too old. And now he's just... I'll never see him again.""


 


Charlie pulled her into the hug this time. She wasn't sure if he had meant how she was doing with Rowle or how she really was, but Remus was what she needed to talk about. Rowle and the things he did to her didn't even matter anymore. His body morphed back to his own long before she finished talking and crying. Tonks had never been so grateful to have a friend to cry to. And seeing him as himself... she cried harder than ever just knowing he really was okay. 


 


When it was time for him to go, he gently glamoured her so that it appeared her arm was still broken and all the bruises and cuts were still there. No one could know that ""Blaise"" was up and about before he officially rejoined the world tomorrow. Tonks watched as he took the polyjuice to resume the Healer's body. She leaned into him one last time. 


 


""Thank you, Charlie. You've given me more hope than you know.""


 


""I'm going to get us out of here. It may take a while, Dora, but you're not going to be stuck here forever.""


 


***************************


 


Harry heaved a sigh of relief that she was finally asleep again. Hermione was a terrible patient when you were forced to stop her from working. Admittedly, her magical core had healed far more and far faster than Andromeda had expected, but she physically needed to rest, as well. Research wasn't terribly taxing, but they were under clear orders for her to hold off on it until tomorrow at the earliest.


 


She might be willing to go toe to toe with Andromeda, but Harry wasn't. They were going to follow the rules for now. 


 


He smiled at his sister, realizing that she had a quill stuck in her hair. He gently worked it out and feathered the wild curls out behind her on the pillow. How she had gotten it there when she wasn't even doing research or writing essays, he had no idea. 


 


He was really just grateful she was here. He hadn't expected to be allowed to see her anytime soon. They had made it clear that he and Ron should not be in the same place, and that it was important for Hermione to be secluded as well once she had been found. To have her living here...


 


Taking in the space around them, Harry thought fondly that this house felt more like home than any he had ever experienced. It was bizarre considering he was just in an Order safe house, but there was something familiar and welcoming about it. And this room was practically made for Hermione, another sign that made it perfect. 


 


Harry stood, stretching, and his hand knocked into something on top of the antique dresser. After a momentary pause to see if it had woken Hermione, he stepped over to put the item to rights. It turned out to be a picture frame... with a very puzzling picture.


 


The couple weren't familiar to him, though the man had messy black hair and glasses. The woman was laughing, her wild black hair nearly as curly as Hermione's. They were both chasing a little boy who looked eerily familiar as he jetted back and forth on a tiny child's broom. 


 


""Ah, Fleamont and Euphemia,"" Andromeda's voice was next to him as she looked over his shoulder at the picture. Harry almost yelped and had to scramble not to drop the frame again. Andromeda had a wicked gleam in her eye as she patted him on the back. 


 


""Did you know the people who lived here?"" he asked when he could speak again.


 


Andromeda looked taken aback for a moment before her eyes went soft. ""You don't know where we are, do you, child?""


 


Confused, Harry answered, ""No. I'm sure it was someone's estate, but it's just a safe house to me, Dromeda.""


 


""You are wrong, Harry. This house is your birthright.""


 


""My-""


 


""We're in Potter Manor. That photo is your father as a young boy, with his parents, your grandparents.""


 


Harry stared at her, stunned. ""I... we're in a Manor that belongs... to me?"" 


 


She began tidying the room, probably to keep him from feeling watched, Harry knew. He didn't have any idea how to process what she had just told him. Andromeda kept talking casually, a chatter with no need for response, though she was covertly watching him.


 


When he was finally ready, he spoke, ""I never knew their names. My grandparents. I know Mum's, because they were Dudley's grandparents as well. But Dad's side... this Manor...""


 


""It is shameful that those who were supposed to help and guide you decided to keep things from you instead. I can't fix that for you, but I can help you from this point forward. There is a lot to learn about being the Lord of an Ancient and Noble House.""


 


""Lord?"" Harry echoed.


 


""Yes, dear,"" she replied. ""You are Lord Potter. This Manor belongs to you. You have a seat on the Wizengamot, and enough vaults to rival the Blacks and the Malfoys.""


 


""How... how could they just not tell me about 

any

 of that?""


 


Andromeda sighed. ""I honestly don't know, Harry. I have some beliefs about Dumbledore and his plans, but they are unflattering, and largely irrelevant now that the man is gone and so much has changed.""


 


""Do you think it's still up to me? Killing Tom, I mean,"" Harry asked, his voice somewhere between innocent, determined, and frightened.


 


""If we choose to believe that stupid prophecy, then yes. But we could also chuck it out a window instead and let our own choices give us our paths.""


 


Harry nodded again, slowly. ""All I want is to marry Ginny, raise a family, and live to see Tom Riddle dead. I wish I could do those things without it coming down to Ron, Hermione, and I.""


 


""Perhaps then, you are changing the fate the seer assigned to you. Claim your birthright, Harry Potter. You are more than what you have been told you must be."" Andromeda's words felt like a spring breeze, their inherent life-changing power washing over Harry.


 


It had never occurred to him that he could be more. In hindsight, he had been raised to die that night at the battle, though how he had been expected to do that 

and

 kill Voldemort, he wasn't sure. He didn't think Dumbledore had foreseen him living through the experience. 


 


He wasn't sure he expected himself to live through finishing Voldemort off, if he even could. But he wanted to. And he wanted to prepare for that life beyond. He wanted it, and he was going to make it happen.


 


They all would.


 

No major triggers in this part. A little violence near the end, but very minor for this story.

It did take me the full two weeks. I'm so excited to get into the next chapter, so I'm hoping I get it out at the week mark, but no promises. 

Omnenomnom is my amazing alpha and highlyintelligentblonde is my wonderful beta.

I don't own Harry Potter.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Friday, June 5th


 


Draco wanted out of this damn bed. He was so sick of not 

doing

 anything. And he truly did feel better. Even though his dream of Hermione had left him frustrated beyond belief, he had still felt better when he woke that morning. His magic was even coming back faster this time. But he was still stuck in the infirmary, in bed, in limbo while life went on around him. 


 


Even joining the Order of the Phoenix sounded good - hanging out with Potty and the Weasel - if it meant he didn't have to stay here. They could all share a cuppa while his wife...shit, he hadn't meant to think of Granger that way, or of her at all. The pain he felt doubled when he actively thought about her. The need for her was a constant ache, somewhat dulled after the dream but then he would think about the feel of her lips on his and have to hold back the moans that wanted to escape. How could he possibly be this needy? Anytime he wasn't policing his own mind, it wandered to her. Some nights the pain was excruciating, the intense desire to touch her or even just to hold her. To be held. Draco blinked back tears and frowned at the unusual show of sentimentality.


 


He knew he was also in a pissy mood because of the date. June 5th. His birthday. Not that anyone cared, or even remembered. He was 18 today. He felt like he had lived several decades longer than that already. And far longer than he wanted to be around. These last two or three years had been brutal. He wasn't about to acknowledge it, but some broken part of him wished to once again be the spoiled brat he knew he had been in childhood. He wanted to worship his father and be a proud Malfoy, to be back on top of the world - the Slytherin prince, newly graduated and with the world at his feet. That's what his 18th birthday was supposed to look like.


 


Draco sighed. Charlie was out shadowing the guard he had chosen to replace, learning how he spoke and moved so that no one would notice the switch. It would happen soon and then Draco would be here alone even more. Blaise was struggling to make it through the days, but had returned to his rounds as soon as Charlie grudgingly allowed it. 

That

 had been quite the row. They were each trying to protect the other. It was sickeningly sweet. And he was jealous. Disgusting.


 


In truth, Draco was itching to be an active part of their efforts. He might be moody and angry, but he was tired of being constantly afraid and helpless. He wasn't incompetent. He could do 

something

 to help. Blaise was wearing himself too thin, especially when he still really needed to be in bed recovering. Perhaps Draco could take on some of his duties - brewing potions, at least. Maybe delivering when Blaise was tired? There had to be things he could do. Alone in the infirmary, Draco Malfoy made himself a promise for his birthday - a gift, if you will. He was going to do some good for the people trapped here, even if the other two protested. 


 


*******************


 


This whole day had been a struggle. Blaise knew that Charlie was right and he shouldn't be out of bed yet. But every day that Charlie went in his stead brought anxiety so crippling that Blaise hadn't been able to recover any in bed either. Besides, the Dark Lord would only accept him being abed for so long without them sending for someone new. Which had given him this new idea.


 


Pausing at the infirmary door, Blaise took a few fortifying breaths and looked around to be sure no one else was present to see or hear when he opened the door.  Because, as usual, when he opened it and stepped through the wards, he was hit with a wall of sounds - Charlie mid-story and Draco laughing - and the sight of the two unlikely friends sitting across from each other on infirmary beds, a butterbeer in each of their hands that Charlie must have nicked from somewhere.


 


When Charlie's sparkling blue eyes met his, Blaise's breath caught. It wasn't fair for one man to be so beautiful, for his smile to wash over Blaise like summer sunshine and make the world brighter. They had crossed some sort of invisible line during the excruciating hours of healing after Bellatrix's spell. Before, if Charlie touched him it hadn't been real. It was the sort of thing that he had to do to survive Bellatrix. They had been hard to ignore, but Blaise knew he had to. The touches now were casual but... familiar, as if Charlie needed the reassurance that Blaise was still there and felt safe checking. Blaise wasn't about to make any first moves, but now that Charlie's actions were more genuinely from himself, Blaise didn't want to keep walking away.


 


Packing away those thoughts, Blaise grinned at the two of them and asked, ""Are we ready to get this party started?""


 


Charlie gave a tiny nod as he grinned back, flourishing three new butterbeers. Draco looked confused until Blaise conjured the birthday cake his favorite elf had agreed to make on the sly. At that, his eyes widened and a grin broke across his face. For Draco, that was a huge show of emotion.


 


""You didn't think we had forgotten your birthday, did you?"" Blaise asked, knowing by the look on his face that Draco had spent the day feeling sorry for himself. No matter what he went through, he was always going to be an overdramatic prat.


 


""To be fair,"" Charlie added, ""I couldn't have remembered it since I never knew you before, but I certainly wouldn't let it pass now that I know.""


 


Draco's grin was even bigger as the three dug into their cake. ""I suppose you worthless tossers didn't get me any gifts this year?"" he asked jokingly.


 


""Sorry, oh Slytherin Prince, no worldly goods could be found that would be good enough for you,"" Charlie said with a mock bow. ""Which is why our gifts are a bit more abstract.""


 


Draco's eyebrows shot up his forehead and his cheeks flushed. ""You didn't really get me anything, did you?"" he asked, his voice uncertain. 


 


""No, it's more like we're giving you opportunities,"" Blaise explained with a smirk, ""that you will be working hard for yourself."" 


 


He was honestly surprised to see how eager Draco looked at that. Working hard for himself wasn't something the Draco he grew up with would have been pleased about at all. Even knowing everything he had been through and watching him change, it still sometimes floored Blaise to know how very different Draco was becoming.


 


""Blaise here has found you a new career path,"" Charlie offered, lounging on the bed he had claimed. 


 


""What?"" he questioned, sharp grey eyes on his old friend. 


 


A roll of Blaise's eyes let Charlie know how he felt about the way that had been revealed, but he didn't hold off any longer explaining. Draco looked like he was going to fall off the bed; he was leaning forward so far, like a kid waiting impatiently for a treat.


 


""You're going to be my new Healer apprentice. The Dark Lord commanded I pick someone, so you're it.""


 


""Really?"" Draco positively beamed at him before his face clouded over suddenly, ""But I'm supposed to be in a coma.""


 


""Well, that's the brilliant part, you see,"" Charlie said. ""Our Blaise has come up with the idea to use the man I'm becoming as a glamoured stand-in, lie-in really, for you. We'll glamour you and claim you're a new recruit.""


 


""What happens if they find out?"" Draco asked, a little uncertainty still dampering his reaction.


 


""They won't,"" Blaise said with confidence. ""I'm afraid you'll mostly be brewing potions and making my hidden deliveries at first, unless the Dark Lord specifically requests to see the apprentice. You may have to treat a few people who come to the infirmary.""


 


They both knew that Voldemort never bothered to speak with someone as lowly as an apprentice. And it was quite rare that anyone but them would come to the infirmary. It was there in case of long-term healing needs, but most of the people that would apply to were killed instead. Draco's useful blood, for instance, was the only kind of thing that would keep someone alive long enough to heal from damage that intense.


 


""This sounds... wonderful,"" Draco said, seeming timid to believe it. ""Wait, where do I sleep? Where do we hide the real me?""


 


""That's 

his

 brilliant gift,"" Blaise grinned and gestured to Charlie.


 


""I couldn't do it alone and Blaise is pants at extension spells, we've found. But you and I are going to make a secret room where my hidden niche is right now. So we can have a proper room with beds and everything. I have the space prepared, I just need someone to help hold one side while I expand the other.""


 


Draco's eyes were gleaming, ""Yes! Can we do it now?""


 


Charlie laughed. ""As much as I would like to say yes, I think you're forgetting something.""


 


""What?"" Draco demanded, just a bit petulant.


 


""Your magic still hasn't completely returned,"" Blaise said. ""You're making much better progress this time, but you will still need to be fully functional to create this room. Let's give it a few days.""


 


Draco huffed, but ultimately let it go. Blaise felt satisfied when he saw Draco giving a tiny smirk now and then as the three sat talking and laughing. Maybe they were all going to be okay again someday after all.


 


******************************


 


Hermione dropped her head onto the giant tome she had been reading. She was exhausted and not a bit closer to figuring out Hogwarts' warding problem, despite having gone through more than three-quarters of the books she had brought back from the castle. Even the journals of the founders hadn't helped, though she knew there were a couple more handwritten books somewhere in her bag. She tried to pull her head back up - if Andromeda saw her like this, she would stop allowing the research until Hermione was fully recovered. She wasn't sure that would ever happen. 


 


Her magic just wasn't recovering enough. Andromeda had theories, but she was researching before she would explain anything to Hermione. The older woman had told her that it was a subject too close to her heart for her to be able to research it objectively. Hermione hated to admit that she was probably right.


 


Regardless of why, the toll of her magic being gone coupled with growing a new life meant that Hermione was confined to her bed the vast majority of each day, no matter how she protested. She was just barely allowed to come into this library, small and cozy though it was. The way she was feeling right now - defeated and depleted - was why, but she didn't have to like it.


 


""Do you get a lot of information that way?"" a cocky male voice quipped, ""I find that bringing my eyes where I can see the words is more effective.""


 


Hermione drug her head up, finally, resting it in her hands. Glancing up through her mane of frizzy curls, she saw a tall, scrawny boy. His shoulders were a little hunched as though he were trying to look shorter and blend in. His hair was dark and curly, his eyes a sapphire blue. He looked vaguely familiar, but she couldn't place him. Ignoring his question, she asked, ""Who are you?""


 


""I asked you a question first. I don't know that I should answer when you ignored my own,"" he replied haughtily. Hermione almost giggled at the way he turned up his nose while also flickering his gaze down it so he could still see her. She rolled her eyes at him with equal dramatics.


 


""Your question was ridiculous. Of course I don't get a lot of information from collapsing on my books. I do, however, get more information from them when I allow myself to rest now and then.""


 


She was surprised by the look of alarm in his eyes when she said the last bit. His hand almost touched her arm as he squatted down next to her. ""Are you overtired? I can get Dromeda or Harry if you need help getting back to bed. Merlin, I can't believe she let you out of it in the first place.""


 


""No!"" she almost cried, ""Please don't get them. I'll be trapped in that bed forever.""


 


""Where you should be if you're not well!"" he whisper-shouted. Even though his eyes were tinged with concern, he was honoring her request not to alert anyone else. Hermione was pleased but so curious about what she did to earn such conspiratorial trust. 


 


""But I need to figure this out!"" Her frustration came through her words.


 


""What is 'this' that's so important then?"" he asked, sliding into a seat at the other end of the table.


 


""Just the wards at Hogwarts,"" Hermione huffed.


 


""They're still trying to figure them out? It's been weeks!"" he sputtered. 


 


""Have you worked on them?"" she asked excitedly.


 


""No, they wouldn't let me,"" he explained.


 


""Why not?"" 


 


He shifted uncomfortably. ""I'm just...not someone they have reason to trust.""


 


""I'm sure they will once you've been here a while,"" she told him. Hermione knew most of the people in the house were new Order members. It made sense that they weren't trusted with such a sensitive topic yet, though she was a little confused how this fellow even knew about it. 


 


""I can help you,"" he said suddenly. ""Wards are a bit of a specialty of mine.""


 


""Really?"" 


 


""Yes,"" he said. ""I...had a need as a child to keep myself safe. That's what started it,"" he explained. ""Then I found that the more complicated they got, the more I enjoyed them - picking them apart and weaving them back together. It's like a beautiful piece of artwork, a puzzle sometimes, but gorgeous no matter what.""


 


The way his eyes lit up made Hermione smile. He meant it when he said he loved wards, she could tell. She began explaining the problem to him and he quickly grasped everything she told him. It wasn't long before they sunk deep into the theory of what was going on and how it might be fixed. 


 


Another hour or two had passed by the time they started climbing out. She had a list of things they would research, and a promise from him that he would help her with more of it tomorrow.


 


""You still haven't told me who you are,"" she stated as they began gathering things. 


 


He licked his lips as though nervous and looked away. ""I'm Theo,"" he said, his voice a whisper, as though he would have been happier to exist with no name at all. 


 


Her eyes went wide. ""Theo as in Theodore Nott???"" she asked, the unbridled enthusiasm in her voice seemed to startle him, as though he wasn't used to anyone reacting well to his name.


 


His uncertain ""yes"" confirmed that he wasn't sure what to think of this reception.


 


""You know!"" she cried excitedly.


 


""Know what?"" he asked, confused.


 


""Who it is,"" she replied impatiently. ""My husband! My...baby's father. You are the only person on our side who knows.""


 


She was staring at him expectantly so she saw it practically in slow motion as the blood drained from his face. He looked like he might be ill at any moment.


 


""Merlin, the baby..."" Theo ran a hand down his face. ""I can't tell you. I'm so sorry, but..."" 


 


""What?"" she cried.


 


Theo took a deep breath. Hermione noticed that he was shaking. ""I can't. You...you'll hate him. You'll hate 

me

 for even knowing him. You won't understand.""


 


He looked like he might be sick, but Hermione's anger was overwhelming her. She didn't even try to keep her voice low as she screamed at him. ""I won't understand? I won't understand that what? That he's some poor situational Death Eater? That he never meant to do it, I bet? I won't understand that some buddy of yours raped me but you feel more beholden to him than to our side? Is that what I won't understand!?""


 


""No...I mean, some of it, kind of."" He was backing away from her, his hands in front of him as if to ward her off.


 


""I need answers, Mr. Nott. Now!"" Hermione yelled.


 


That seemed to change something for him. He stopped backing up, but his voice dropped to a deep whisper and his eyes fluttered closed for a moment as if in pain, ""Don't call me that. Please just call me Theo. I don't...I'm not one of them. I don't ever want to be associated with that name or those people again.""


 


They stared at each other, both panting a little. Hermione was trying to rein in her anger and by the look on his face, she knew Theo was gathering some sort of strong emotions back under control. She saw his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed hard.


 


""Well?"" she prompted.


 


He looked like he would rather be anywhere but here. Theo opened his mouth to speak, but it seemed like he couldn't push out any sound. Before he could force himself to say anything, there was a thunder of footsteps in the hallway and Harry rounded the corner into the library. 


 


""Mione, are you okay? I heard shouting."" Harry said. Looking toward the spot she was facing, his eyes widened for a moment at the sight of Theo, then he added coldly, ""What are you doing to her?""


 


Theo cringed back, looking like he had been slapped. ""I didn't...""


 


Hermione put a hand on Harry's shoulder to bring his focus back on her. ""He hasn't done anything wrong, Harry. He's just about to tell me who did this to me.""


 


Harry turned and gave an appraising look over this boy that Hermione had heard he was fast becoming friends with. ""You've known all this time?"" Harry questioned, his voice somewhere between angry and hurt.


 


If it was possible, Theo became even more pale. ""I... If no one asked I didn't think-""


 


""What? You didn't think that you should reveal information about the enemy? Things we might need to know? What else are you hiding?"" Harry demanded. 


 


As angry as Hermione was that Theo had balked at telling her, she could see the panic and fear in his eyes and she realized she didn't want him to lose Harry. Or Harry to lose him, either. There was some kind of connection between the two, and she had a feeling that they 

both

 needed whatever it was. She tried to intercede, ""Harry, Theo... Let's-""


 


""He's 

not

 the enemy,"" Theo cried, his voice passionate, but almost broken. ""He... you won't understand or give him a chance. And... and I know he doesn't deserve it and he was awful to you all, but he did everything he could and-""


 


""Who the fuck is it, Nott?"" Harry demanded.


 


Hermione saw Theo flinch from his own name again. He had backed all the way to the wall, looking desperate and upset. 


 


""Harry, wait."" she said, getting between the two and leaning into her brother so that he was too busy with her to advance any further on Theo. ""I don't think he was withholding valuable information. I'm sure no one asked until now. And it wouldn't be important to anyone but me, right?""


 


Harry looked down at her with a frown. ""Your safety is important to the Order and we need to know who might come after you, Mione. So yeah, I think this is valuable information.""


 


""Well, he's going to let us know now even though he clearly doesn't want to. Theo, just tell us and it'll be over."" Hermione smiled at him, hoping it might be encouraging.


 


Theo looked like he might hyperventilate. He stared at the floor for a moment before they heard his anguished whisper. ""No. He's been my best mate my whole life. Sometimes he was the only person in the world that was willing to stand up for me. I can't... this feels like a betrayal and I can't... If we traded places, Draco would never do this to m-""


 


""

Malfoy?!

 That worthless piece of-"" Harry began in a roar.


 


Theo was so white he looked like he would pass out. ""Please, let me expla-""


 


He didn't get the chance to explain because both boys surged forward to catch Hermione as she slid to the ground, the shock knocking her unconscious.


 


**************************


 


If he paused to think about it, Draco would be disgusted with himself for the eagerness he was feeling. So he didn't pause, rushing headlong through the now-familiar pathways toward the fountain. This day had turned out so well, and now to be gifted time with her? To be able to make progress with what they started last time? His body was longing for her. 

He

 was longing for her. Draco hoped he wouldn't need to wait long for her tonight.


 


He was pleased when he burst into their clearing and she was already there. Until he saw the look on her face. She had been crying and now she looked ready to murder someone. 


 


""Hermione, what's wrong? Are you okay?"" he heard himself say. The concern in his voice shocked him as much as it did her. She looked momentarily soft and vulnerable before it melted back to fury.


 


His long strides took him quickly past the fountain and almost to her side before he felt something hard hit him. Draco flew backward as his witch stormed toward him. 


 


""All along,"" she shouted, ""all this time, it's been 

you

! I knew it had to be... should have known... How fucking dare you come near me? How dare you try to 

touch

 me after what you've done!?""


 


Draco felt his heart sink. She 

knew

. He felt panic overwhelming him even as he tried to remind himself this was just a dream, just his fear of her finding out. 


 


""Please, let's not do this. It was a good day and I want...I 

need

 time with you.""


 


Hermione stalked even closer. ""

You

 need? What about 

my

 needs? I 

need

 my memories back! I 

need

 to not be married. I 

need

 to have not been raped. I need a lot of things, Malfoy, but apparently you don't care about me and my needs. It's all about you!""


 


She shot him with a stinging hex as she spoke. And another. And another. 


 


""Ow!"" He tried to dodge but failed, ""I do care! I never meant-""


 


Draco gasped as a slicing hex hit his head just above the eye. Was that what she was aiming for or was she so upset she couldn't even cast properly? And if that wasn't where she had meant to hit him, did he even want to know what she had really been aiming for?


 


""I don't want to hear your bloody excuses!"" she screamed.


 


Draco was gasping as blood ran down from the wound above his eye. She had gotten his arms, chest, stomach, and legs as well. They were small surface cuts, but each spell that hit was a little deeper as her anger seemed to be growing. 


 


""I hate you, Draco Malfoy! And you've known all this time and Merlin how could I have been such an idiot to think you were just some stand-in for a random Death Eater? That's how much I didn't want it to be you, Malfoy. I was praying that my brain just latched on to the one hated face that I knew.""


 


He felt a wrenching pain blossoming out through his body from the heart, the connection point of the shimmery little string tying them together. Draco could barely breathe through the throbbing pain that seemed to be choking him. It was so much worse than the little hexes she had thrown.


 


Hermione was right in front of him now, her fist slamming into his nose like it had years before. Then there were punches to his stomach, a knee to his groin. Kicks and fists everywhere she could reach. 


 


Draco didn't fight back. He knew he deserved this even if it wasn't what he wanted right now. He wanted to be curled up in her arms talking and kissing and when the fuck had that want appeared? But he owed her this, no matter how painful it was at the moment. He would wake up soon enough anyway. 


 


Her punches were growing weaker as she dissolved into tears, great wracking sobs overtaking her body. Draco wasn't sure what to do. Every instinct said he should pull her into his arms and hold her while she cried. Some small sense of self-preservation made him hesitate. 


 


But when Hermione backed away from him and slid to the ground... he couldn't keep himself away. She needed him. And more than anything he wanted or needed for himself, he had to take care of her, couldn't stand to see her in pain like this. It made the pain inside him radiate outward until he was moving forward almost without meaning to.


 


Draco gathered her into his arms, whispering how sorry he was. Hermione sobbed against his chest, her rigid body practically melting into him after a few moments. The throbbing feeling inside him released slightly, enough that he could get a good, deep breath. He held her close to him and breathed in the scent of her hair, letting it wash through him and calm the pain he had felt so intensely before. She allowed him to rub her back and card his fingers through her beautiful hair, petting her like a cat. 


 


He knew instantly when she really remembered it was 

him

 giving her comfort. She looked up into his eyes, a hard look on her face. The crushing pain was back in an instant, her rejection hitting him even more intensely as her magic flung him across the garden to hit the side of the fountain, the garden fading around him as his vision slowly went black.





















I promise she won't hate him forever. Just another bump in the road. We all knew she wasn't going to take it well when she found out, right?

No trigger warnings for this one. There's some blood, hence the title, but nothing terrible. Side note on that - what possessed me to title chapters? Every now and then something really fitting pops into my head, but most of the time, they're a pain in the ass. 

Anyway... this chapter feels a little different. We're getting into a segment where some different magics will come into play. I hope you enjoy it, and I really hope to hear what you think of it whether you like it or if you don't!

My alpha, omnenomnom, is a godsend. I love her. My beta, highlyintelligentblonde, helped me catch a detail I had missed this chapter and needed to slip in some clarification. Aaaaand... In case I forget to say this in the future, I want to acknowledge Megamegaturtle as an Alpha in the coming-up-with-wild-ideas sense. I know some of the details of how we're going to defeat Voldemort now!!! *ahem* Not saying I had no clue before, but... that's so far into the distant future...I had NO CLUE beyond that it would happen somehow. Now there's a plan and I'm excited about all the things I can weave together between now and then to make it happen!

You guessed it. I don't own Harry Potter.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Saturday, June 6th








""Blaise..."" 


 


He heard the urgent voice through the fog of his dreams, but Blaise was so exhausted he was having a hard time waking. Somewhere around him, there was murmuring from the baritone voice he loved so much. 


 


""Are you okay?""


 


""No, I need Blaise... I can't wake him."" This was the urgent voice. There was barely contained panic laced through it.


 


""Can I help? Shite! What happened to you?""


 


Blaise finally came awake at Charlie's startled exclamation. ""Wha's wrong?"" he asked, voice slurred with sleep. But as soon as his eyes were fully open and focused, he could see the problem. 


 


Draco leaned on the end of the bed, apparently able to stand, but with blood trickling down his face from a cut above his eye and an obviously broken nose. There was more blood on his arms and coming through a spot in his shirt. He had bruises everywhere. But the most alarming thing to Blaise's visual assessment was that he seemed unable to breathe properly. Whether that was something physical or from the wild panic he could see in his friend's eyes, he wasn't sure, but he needed to find out. 


 


Blaise tried to get up, but felt his own muscles spasm and resist his instructions. Charlie's strong arms were around him and pulling him up before he had time to ask. Once standing, he was okay. Well, okay enough. He made his way to Draco as Charlie waved his wand to light the room. Draco looked even worse in the light. 


 


Lifting his own wand, Blaise cast a diagnostic over Draco. He stared at it, trying to make sense of what it told him. Somewhat absently, he began healing the broken nose, small cuts, and as many bruises as he could currently see. He knew his own less-than-recovered state and the bone-deep exhaustion he felt was impairing his ability to understand what he was seeing.


 


""What happened, Draco?"" Charlie tried again.


 


Eyes wide and panicky, Draco shook his head. ""Nothing. It couldn't have...""


 


Charlie wrinkled his brow as he stared at the younger man. ""Something happened. You know we're not going to judge you, whatever it was."" He was speaking to Draco very gently, as if he expected him to run for it. 


 


""I... It was just a dream. The rose garden..."" Draco was too frazzled to finish a sentence. 


 


Then the words suddenly worked through Blaise's slow mental process. ""The rose garden dreams where you see Hermione?"" he asked, his brain finally clicking into motion.


 


""Yes,"" Draco panted, the panic only seeming to increase with each word he managed. ""Hermione hates me."" 


 


Charlie looked confused. ""You have dreams about Hermione?"" 


 


""Yes. And they're... they're so real,"" he whimpered.


 


""Why do you say she hates you?"" Charlie asked.


 


Draco dropped onto the edge of Blaise's bed, seemingly unable to hold himself up a moment longer. He ran his hands through his blood-streaked hair, cursing as he found a spot at the back of his head where it was coming from. Blaise moved to heal it as Draco was working up the courage to speak. ""She 

knows

. Blaise, she knows the bond is with me. She knows I... what I did to her. I don't know how, but... she does. And she hates me for it. For everything, but more than ever now."" 


 


""Calm down, Drake,"" Blaise finally managed to gather his thoughts. ""It was just a dream, right?""


 


""It hurts. It hurts so fucking much. She is rejecting our bond, rejecting me, and Blaise, I feel like I'm going to die."" Draco had fallen over on the bed, tears rolling down his cheeks, shaking from pain.


 


""You have a concussion. Take some deep breaths while I work on it,"" Blaise told him, trying to use his calm Healer voice.


 


""I can't,"" Draco said, gasping in a way that worried Blaise. ""I can't breathe, Blaise. It fucking hurts.""


 


""Where does it hurt, Draco? The damn diagnostics don't make any sense. None of this makes any sense."" Blaise was frustrated and honestly scared. He didn't know what to do for pain that had no explanation. Draco's only response was more whimpering.


 


""Guys,"" Charlie interrupted quietly, ""How did this happen?""


 


Blaise looked up at him and almost snapped at how calm he seemed. ""What do you mean?""


 


""He couldn't have done these injuries to himself. He was in a room alone. Draco, in the dream, did you get hurt?""


 


""She hexed me and then punched and... I let her. I know I deserve it. And then I held her while she was crying and when she remembered it was 

me

 her magic threw me and I think I hit my head on something."" His words were slow, slipping out between pained breaths. 


 


Blaise exchanged a look with Charlie. ""So you're saying that all the injuries you have now are the same injuries you received in the dream?""


 


There was a long pause before Draco tried to nod, groaned in pain, and whispered, ""Yes.""


 


Charlie was silent for a moment while Blaise continued to work on Draco. ""What are the chances that those aren't just dreams?"" 


 


""How could they possibly be real?"" Blaise wondered as he rolled Draco over and performed every spell he could think of that might help him breathe better.


 


Charlie bit his lower lip, a common sign that he was thinking deeply. ""I don't know, but how could they possibly be dreams when he came out of it with the same injuries? That's one hell of a coincidence. You said it was a goblin blood ritual, right?""


 


Draco groaned something that was probably meant to be an affirmative, so Charlie went on. ""A bond like that is intense. I don't know enough to be sure of what it means - I wish Bill were here - but maybe it's possible that they're so deeply linked that their minds have created this place for the two of them to meet in?""


 


Blaise was thinking hard. ""I suppose that's possible, though a bond like that would probably need something to work with ahead of time to be so strong. A deep emotional bond, I would think.""


 


""Wasn't he her childhood bully? Not to mention the Death Eater, best friend of the Chosen One thing?"" Charlie asked bluntly. ""Sorry Draco, I know you aren't a complete knob but I don't see how they could have had feelings for each other as sworn enemies.""


 


It wasn't the same situation, but... Blaise looked into Charlie's eyes as he said, ""Is it so unbelievable to fall for someone on the other side?"" 


 


The blush that spread over Charlie's cheeks and down his chest was well worth the distraction from the matter at hand.


 


""We weren't anything like the two of you,"" Draco grunted, making them both blush and look away. 


 


After a moment, Charlie said, ""Well, it would have to be something significant even if it wasn't... love."" Blaise felt something blossoming in his chest, but he knew this really wasn't the time.


 


""Hatred?"" Draco asked weakly.


 


""You never hated her and you know it,"" Blaise responded testily. ""You hated what she was but that's not the same.""


 


Draco looked away, refusing to acknowledge that. Trying to push himself up from the bed and failing, he said, ""We were both virgins. Would that do it?""


 


Charlie gave a low whistle. ""I don't know if that would create this kind of link, but it definitely impacted the strength of the bond. Blaise, would you be able to get into the library and see if you could find out anything on bonding?""


 


Draco shook his head the tiniest bit, ""She took the only book on marriage bonds with her. I've looked.""


 


""I can look again, just in case. Or maybe something about dream magic would have answers,"" Blaise said, then moved to a more pressing subject, ""Draco, what did she cast on your chest? I can't find the source.""


 


""The bond. Where it's connected feels like it's turning to ice. She 

hates

 me and it feels like... I would rather face the Dark Lord again,"" he whimpered. 


 


""Should we give him something so he can sleep?"" Charlie asked.


 


Blaise shook his head. ""He needs to stay awake for a while because of the concussion, but also... there's no way to control when he goes into the dream world with her. If it is real...""


 


""Then she could hurt him some more,"" Charlie completed the thought that Blaise couldn't stand to finish. ""Does Dreamless Sleep help? Has he ever had these special dreams when he's taken it?""


 


Blaise sighed in relief. ""I should have thought of that. We haven't experimented. They were just harmless dreams before. If anything..."" Blaise's eyes widened with realization. ""The dream when you felt so much better after - what did you do in 

that

 dream?""


 


Draco groaned, ""Shite. Even thinking about that hurts."" 


 


""Draco."" 


 


""Fine, fine! We kissed alright? I didn't know it was 

actually 

her.""


 


""So his magical core responds to positive physical interactions in the dream world,"" Charlie mused. 


 


Blaise cast the diagnostic again quickly and peered closely. ""You said you held her for a time?""


 


""She needed it,"" Draco responded defensively.


 


Charlie walked over for a closer look at the symbols floating over Draco's head. ""Does this mean that his core is still stable?"" He pointed before dropping his hand along Blaise's arm, a quick check-in that made Blaise feel warm all over. 


 


""Yes,"" he answered. ""For all that he's hurt and certainly hasn't improved, it wasn't detrimental to his magic.""


 


""How odd,"" Charlie said, still staring at the diagnostics. ""I would have thought her rejection of the bond would have affected that before just causing physical pain.""


 


""True... Unless-""


 


""Could you not talk about me like I'm not here?"" Draco snarled, wincing with the pain of speaking.


 


Blaise and Charlie looked at each other. How this bond might work was clearly not a topic to discuss in front of their friend right now. 


 


""Have I told you about the time we snuck a fully grown Welsh Green into a muggle hotel on the way to the reserve in Germany?"" Charlie began. 


 


There wasn't much Draco would be able to 

do

 with the level of pain he was in. Blaise gratefully let the sound of Charlie's voice entertain him as he worked to get Draco as comfortable as possible. 


 


**********************


 


The kitchen was still quiet and cozy. It was one of Harry's favorite parts of the mansion. His mansion, or manor since Dromeda seemed to consider it that. When he had commented that it wasn't big enough to be one, she had made a non-committal sound and said, ""We'll see,"" with a cryptic smile.


 


As he thought about it, Harry had to admit that it seemed to be getting bigger. Just after the recruits had arrived, he remembered standing in the dining room and commenting that it wasn't big enough. But it was large enough now for two long tables of people, everyone they had now could squeeze in together. He didn't really understand it, but he was pleased. 


 


There were so many questions he needed to ask. He had been too deeply in shock when she first told him of his heritage. But now... 


 


Harry looked up at the sounds of someone entering the room. Theo shuffled in, head down, a shadow of himself, looking drawn with red, puffy eyes he was trying to hide. A part of Harry wanted to say or do something to make the other boy feel better, but he still couldn't believe what he had been holding back. Harry had thought he could be trusted. Now he wasn't sure.


 


For a moment, it seemed like Theo was going to say something. Then he turned and started cooking Harry's favorite breakfast instead. Harry sipped his coffee and tried to ignore the tension in the room. 


 


""Will you eat this?"" Theo asked softly. ""From me?""


 


Harry didn't answer for a moment. But he finally said, ""Depends. How much poison did you put in?""


 


Theo cracked the tiniest smile, a breath of relief escaping him. ""Not enough to kill you immediately.""


 


""Good. I have things to do today,"" Harry said. ""It better hold off until at least three.""


 


It looked like Theo was about to say something else when Andromeda swept into the room. ""Harry,"" she said in greeting. ""I'm glad you're up and ready.""


 


""Why?"" He was suddenly on alert. What could be going on now? The recruits were doing well and Harry wasn't expecting anyone else anytime soon, though he supposed there wasn't much of a way to pass information now that the floos were closed.


 


""It's nothing to panic about,"" she assured him as she regally accepted the cup of tea Theo offered her. ""We will discuss it after breakfast.""


 


She stepped over to the stove and began to load up her plate. When Theo made to take it from her and serve her instead, she slapped the boy's hands away. ""Take your seat and eat your own food, young man."" Andromeda took a good long look at him at that moment. ""And eat extra, you don't look well at all.""


 


Theo looked like he wanted to argue, but bowed his head to her after a moment and took his own plate to the table, as far from Harry as he could get. Harry considered being offended, but he had a feeling that Theo chose that seat in deference to Harry's feelings rather than his own.


 


When Andromeda turned around and looked at the two of them, she huffed. ""Ah, more surliness. Wonderful. What's happened?""


 


There was silence for a moment before they both tried to speak. Ducking his head, Theo allowed Harry to go first. He almost wished the other boy hadn't. Harry cleared his throat and said, ""Theo knew who married and forced themselves on Mione. He's been hiding it.""


 


Theo's cheeks flamed and he looked like he might cry, but he didn't say anything. Andromeda eyed him with a sharp look. ""Why would you keep that information to yourself?"" she asked.


 


""She wasn't back yet when I got to the Order, but I knew he had gotten her out of the Manor somehow. I thought... He's my best mate. Practically my brother. What happened was awful, but it was for him, too,"" he said softly. 


 


Harry felt rage again, felt like flipping the table over as he stood. ""I don't want to hear how poor Malfoy didn't mean to rape my sister.""


 


Theo flinched. ""It wasn't... please let me expl-""


 


""Draco Malfoy?"" Andromeda cut in. When Harry nodded his confirmation, she rubbed her temples. ""Well that does explain a lot."" Her face had hardened and she gave Theo a look that made him shrink in his seat.


 


There was a tense silence before she spoke again. ""Do sit down, Harry. I agree that this changes how much we can trust your friend here, but I do understand his motivation in keeping it a secret. Family ties are hard to break.""


 


Harry gaped, then argued, ""They're not family! They-""


 


""Is Hermione your sister?"" she asked, unwilling to let him continue the tirade he had planned.


 


""Yes,"" he said begrudgingly. He wasn't going to win against Andromeda.


 


""Then Draco and Theo are brothers. We can and will accept this. We will also accept that who his brother is does not define who 

he

 is. Theo, is there anything else we should know?"" When he didn't speak immediately, she added, ""Keep in mind that this will be your last chance. I do understand you, better than you might imagine, but an insistence of protecting our enemies will not be tolerated further.""


 


Theo seemed to brace himself before saying, ""There is nothing further, but... please let me explain what happened with Draco. It was-""


 


""No,"" Andromeda said. ""It is in your best interest to stop trying to make excuses for him.""


 


""But he-""


 


""Do you see, Dromeda? He's still completely loyal to Malfoy!"" Harry almost shouted.


 


She gave him a look over her teacup. ""Theo is done defending him. Aren't you?"" She quirked an eyebrow at him and Theo nodded, reluctantly, but it was still there.


 


""Now calm yourself, Harry. I want to read my paper in peace."" She pulled out a copy of the Daily Prophet and Harry felt his jaw drop. 


 


""How did you get that?"" he asked. 


 


""My house elf brought it,"" she said absentmindedly as she read. 


 


Harry and Theo's eyes met. 

That

 was a surprise. Clearly, neither of them had known there was a house elf popping off and on the property. Finally unable to hold it in, Harry asked, ""What does it say? What's going on out there?""


 


""Nothing good,"" Andromeda said with her lips pressed together. 


 


They waited impatiently until she finally folded the paper and set it aside. ""The information in there is always slanted anyway, but things are bad."" 


 


Harry felt his heart clench. He had hoped the Order was making good strides with Ron at the helm of their tactics. 


 


""We have been successful at some muggleborn rescues, but there are so many others we don't hear about in time or it seems like they already know before we arrive that we're going to be there."" 


 


""Is there a spy?"" Harry asked. A look passed to Theo made him shrink again. He seemed to know Harry was questioning his loyalty.


 


""There could be, but we're not sure yet,"" she told him. ""Diagon Alley was attacked again a few days ago. The shops are ruined. I don't know if they will be able to come back, even if this ends soon.""


 


""How do you know this?"" Theo asked, curiosity outweighing his reluctance to speak. 


 


""The Order certainly didn't send me here with no way to communicate. My grandson is at the castle with the Weasleys. I trust them, but I would hardly agree to be out of touch with them when Teddy might need me,"" Andromeda said, her tone saying they should have known that much. 


 


The three of them had finished breakfast and were starting to clean up with a few wand swishes when Harry couldn't stand it any longer. ""What is it I'm supposed to be ready for this morning?""


 


""Oh that. We need to find a way to help you claim your Lordship.""


 


""Find a way?"" his sister asked from the doorway. Harry jumped. She wasn't supposed to be downstairs voicing anything, much less the very question he had been thinking.


 


""What do you think you're doing out of bed?"" Andromeda asked.


 


Hermione grinned and practically bounced over to the counter to make a cup of tea. ""I feel fantastic this morning. I had a very... satisfying dream.""


 


Harry felt his eyebrows raise. ""That must have been quite a dream to feel this good,"" he said.


 


""Not like that,"" she told him, rolling her eyes. He blushed and started shaking his head. 

That

 certainly hadn't been what he meant, though he could see Andromeda and Theo stifling a laugh so apparently Hermione wasn't the only one to interpret him that way. 


 


Hermione continued before he could protest out loud. ""I had a dream that I got to shout at Malfoy and let him know 

exactly

 what I think of him. Hexed him and broke his nose, too. I wish it were real."" Her tone was vicious at the end. She was not a witch anyone would want to cross when angry, and she had every reason to be furious with the ferret.


 


The look in Theo's eyes fell from mirthful at the previous exchange to deeply sad. Harry started to get angry again, but then he realized how sad he would feel - how sad he 

did

 feel - that Hermione had been wronged by his own best friend. Ron had hurt her in a different way, but it didn't necessarily change the position he and Theo were in as their friends. 


 


Before he had time to contemplate that further, Hermione made another surprise announcement. ""I think my magic is back in full!"" she enthused.


 


""Really?"" the Andromeda drawled, sounding every bit the skeptical aristocrat. She cast a quick diagnostic and almost stumbled back in shock. ""It appears you are correct, Hermione. I don't know how that could have happened, but it's good. The baby is doing well, too.""


 


Harry saw Hermione's face fall slightly at the reminder of the baby, but then she smiled and said, ""That's good. Now why do you say we have to 'find a way' for Harry to become Lord Potter? Shouldn't that be a straightforward process?""


 


Andromeda gave a sharp nod and began the explanation, ""The traditional way one becomes Lord involves a blood ritual from father to son in advance and then the claiming through Gringotts. Neither of those are possible at this point, but the house will hopefully acknowledge his blood. We just have to figure out how to-""


 


""I know,"" Theo said quietly. ""I've researched, in case I ever had the opportunity to claim it out from under my father.""


 


Andromeda quirked an eyebrow at him and said, ""Go on then."" 


 


""You have to find the heart of the Manor. It's typically a hidden room in the very center. Traditionally, it would look a bit like a study or a lab, depending on the wizard or witch's inclinations who built the place,"" Theo explained.


 


""What do we do when we get there?"" Harry asked


 


""First, the Manor has to recognize you. If the expanding dining room is any indication, I don't think that will be a problem. Assuming it considers you a Potter, it will let you into the secret heart. Then... it will involve your blood, but how and what you do with it may be specific to your family or it may be more standard.""


 


""I believe the Potters have a specific way of going about it,"" Andromeda offered.


 


""Do you know what it is?"" Hermione asked, snagging a piece of fruit from a bowl on the other end of the table by casually levitating it over to herself. She was pleased as she snatched her green apple out of the air.


 


Andromeda shook her head. ""Not completely, but I think Harry will intuitively know when he gets inside. The blood from his hand will need to be spread across the top of the door frame at the beginning. After that... it will be up to him.""


 


""Can the rest of us help him search for the room, at least?"" Hermione asked.


 


""

We

 can, but 

you

 are going back to bed,"" Andromeda told her. 


 


""No! I'm doing fine!"" Hermione insisted. 


 


Andromeda gave her a stern look. ""If you 

must

 do something, I will allow you to continue your research, but you're not wandering the Manor tiring yourself out.""


 


""But I'm perfectly...""


 


Harry didn't hear the rest of their argument. His search had begun. The thing was - it wasn't 

that

 big of a house. The center would be between the sitting and dining rooms. But there was nothing there except a stretch of unadorned hallway. He tried pacing back and forth, thinking hard about what he needed, like the Room of Requirement. That didn't work. He tried 

Revelio

 and several other things Hermione had taught him that might show a secret door. Nothing. He leaned his head against the wall, right where he needed a door to be. 

Show me how to do this

, he thought. Nothing happened. 


 


Harry pushed away from the wall. He was disappointed that it hadn't worked. It had been one of his feelings. He knew it was silly, but he had a lot of pride in following his hunches. As he pulled back, his finger scraped along the stones, ripping the skin enough that blood left a stripe across the wall and dripped down onto the stones below. 


 


He had turned to step away when there was a strange sound deep within the walls of the house. Looking back, he saw that the wall where the hidden room should be was shaking slightly. Then a grating sound, stone on stone, began.


 


As he stared, watching as the wall split and began to move, Harry barely caught himself from falling. The stones below his feet were moving and at first he couldn't tell where they were going. When they stilled, allowing him to regain his footing, a staircase had formed heading up into what appeared to be a tower. The wall that had been there before had folded up to form an inner wall and high archway for the stairs to go through. 


 


His mouth dropped open in surprise. The ancient looking staircase had a beautiful blue and gold runner that looked like it might have been purchased just that day. The sconces on the walls were detailed at the bottom with a crest that Harry assumed must be the Potter family's. From here, he could see a door at the top of the stairs. He hoped that was the door frame he needed to spread his blood over because what had once been the doorframe to the staircase was now on the ceiling. 


 


As Harry approached the door at the top, it slowly swung open for him. He paused before going in to squeeze some more blood from his finger and spread it above the door frame on the outside. He didn't let himself even look around the room he now had access to until he also adorned the inside of the door with his blood. He wasn't sure what it would do, but he didn't want to take the chance of not doing enough. 


 


Turning to see what the heart of Potter Manor contained, Harry was completely enamored. It looked like an armory of defensive equipment. There were weapons carefully stored along one side of the room, some displayed and others just on a rack. Shelves to the side were filled with baskets of jewelry, scarves, hats, and bags. Somehow, Harry just 

knew

 that those were all magical, all some sort of item that could be used for defense. He had been told that the Potters were usually good at defensive magic. Apparently it went deeper than that.


 


He walked over to the shelves, selecting a hat at random and putting it on. When he turned, running his hand through a basket and coming out with some sort of amulet and a couple of bracelets, he saw that a mirror was sat nearby. Harry grinned at himself. The hat actually made him look quite dashing. He shoved the amulet in his pocket, but discarded the two bracelets. Idly, he dug through another basket of jewelry, coming up with two rings that felt... happy and safe on his hand. 


 


He could almost hear Hermione scolding him about not knowing what any of this stuff did. It was true, but... they were all defensive. He was certain of it. The things in this room were safe and they were a part of his heritage. 


 


Reaching over to one of the racks, he selected a small bag with the Potter crest on it. He began picking through the jewelry, shoving in a scarf, four necklaces, a handful of rings, and one bracelet. It was random, but also... the pieces had called to him somehow. Harry felt like he could go through these things all day, but looking up he realized there was a section he hadn't come to yet. 


 


The last part of the room looked like an office. There was a giant bookcase and a desk nearby. Harry made his way over, stopping first at the bookshelf. Every book was about defense. Looking over the titles, he found his eyebrows raising. Judging from the titles, not all of the defensive magical knowledge here was light magic. ""Defensive Torture Methods,"" ""Protecting with Deadly Force,"" and ""Permanent Defense Solutions for Your Enemies"" sounded like they belonged with the Dark Arts.


 


Looking down at his hand, he suddenly rethought putting on rings when he didn't know their purpose. He slid the first one off and dropped it in the bag. The second... he tried to pull it off, but it wouldn't budge. He set his bag down on one of the shelves and began tugging at the ring in earnest. No matter what he did, he couldn't get it off. Harry felt a small surge of panic before calming himself. Nothing bad had happened yet. He would just avoid casting anything that may trigger it. Hermione would help him get it off later. Or Dromeda. 


 


Harry took a couple of deep breaths, then selected two books, ""Protection of the Innocents,"" and ""Advanced Defensive Spells and Dueling Techniques,"" from the shelves and walked to the desk with them. On the desk, there was a book open. When he looked at it, the words seemed to scramble around on the page. Even if they hadn't been jumping about, each letter was fuzzy and he couldn't read a thing. 


 


Looking at the other objects on the desk, he realized one was a letter opener - with a dark substance on the blade. Picking it up, Harry saw that it was blood. Perhaps it was his blood that was necessary to read the book. Taking a deep breath, he tried it. The words stopped moving. But they were still so fuzzy that he couldn't make out what he was supposed to be reading. Something about the hereditary something something Potter... It wasn't enough. 


 


If it wasn't just his blood, what else could he need?


 


He wasn't sure how long he sat there thinking before he noticed that the ring stuck on his finger was glowing. Pulling it up to his face, Harry gasped in surprise. He could clearly see his family crest on top, though he was sure it hadn't been there before. Excited, he rushed to touch the ring to the page, gaping in awe as the writing became perfectly clear. Old, but quite readable.


 


It began, ""This sacred book contains the hereditary duties of the Head of House Potter, granted Lordship by deeds of rescue to the heir of House Black in the year of 1504."" 


 


Harry was surprised at that. He knew that his house descended from the Peverells, so was basically old enough that their heritage had become myth, but he hadn't really thought about how old the established House of Potter might be. To be fair, until yesterday he hadn't been very aware that a House's history was particularly important or something that might impact his current life.


 


He couldn't have said, later, how long he spent in the room, reading and contemplating the history the book contained. When he came to the last page, there was a list of the Lords who had come before him. Picking up the solitary quill on the desktop, he recognized it as one that would write with his blood. This time, that felt absolutely right. He signed his name with a flourish and smiled at the surge of power he felt throughout his blood. He was Lord Potter now and no one would be able to contest it.


 


With a smile, Harry picked up his two books and left the room, realizing he was quite hungry and people were likely worried about him by now. 













What do you think??? I would love to hear how and why you think the bond is working this way. And what did you think of the Potter's hidden room?

I am really excited about the next couple of chapters! Because so much is happening, this is a really long chapter! Or maybe they're just slowly getting longer anyway. There are no trigger warnings for this one.

Omnenomnom gets the snarkiest alpha help ever award. She's wonderful. And I appreciate my beta, highlyintelligentblonde as well!

I do not own Harry Potter.

Sunday, June 7th


 


There was really no explanation for why she went back to the fountain when she found herself in the rose garden today. Hermione knew there was even less reason for her to be irritated that Malfoy wasn't there. It's not like she 

wanted

 to deal with him. But something about the fountain drew her. And once she was here, he was supposed to be, too. 


 


She idly dipped her hand into the water, listening for the sound of his footsteps. Oddly, she didn't hear them this time. He was hazy when he arrived, his edges blurring into the background Hermione found it disconcerting, and was glad when her mind decided to make him as solid as normal. 


 


""Are you going to try to kill me again?"" he drawled.


 


""I should,"" she answered, ""But until now I was having a good day and don't want to ruin it. I wish I weren't here torturing myself but clearly we can't all have what we want.""


 


""Oh yes,"" Draco drawled. ""Because being hexed by you is so much more tolerable than your exposure to my mere presence.""


 


""Shut up. I don't need to be lectured by my own subconscious today.""


 


""Clearly you have the awareness of an aubergine if that's what you think is happening,"" Draco snarled.


 


""It is obviously what is happening. I don't typically dream of people I hate. This is clearly just my brain's way of handling this nightmare without going mad,"" Hermione grumbled.


 


""You don't understand,"" Malfoy responded. He seemed agitated. 


 


""Oh and I suppose you do,"" Hermione scoffed, crossing her arms. ""Please enlighten me oh wise and powerful figment.""


 


""I'm not a figment of your bloody imagination,"" Malfoy snarled. ""Stop saying that. You're not talking to a creation of your mind. It's me. The real me. And you're really you. This isn't a dream.""


 


""That's by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Even coming from you."" Hermione rolled her eyes. 


 


""You are my wife and I'm telling you I am actually here with you. You have to listen to me, Granger,"" he insisted.


 


""Well if I am your wife that makes me a Malfoy, not a Granger,"" she snarked at him. She wasn't going to rise to his ridiculous bait tonight. ""Tell me Darling, do you miss me? How is the house keeping up? I was thinking of redoing the manor; what's your opinion on Ecru vs eggshell?""


 


""You..."" Malfoy seemed at a loss for words. He began raking his hands through his hair. ""Look, call yourself whatever you want but you 

have

 to understand this isn't just a dream. You 

hurt

 me last night.""


 


She didn't want to be angry again, but she was starting to feel it anyway. What was this even processing? The only thing more annoying than having these stupid dreams was when she couldn't figure out what she was trying to tell herself. 


 


To him, she said, ""Good. I meant to. You deserve every bit of it. You deserve worse. I'd do it again now but that requires more effort than I can summon for you.""


 


His fingers were tugging at his hair. ""I know. I 

know

 I deserve it. Why do you think I let you do it? But I didn't think I would be hurt when I woke up.""


 


Hermione started laughing. ""What kind of martyr complex is that? I can't believe my subconscious is giving you so much credit. Though it is 

nice

 to imagine you are in any way apologetic, I don't have time for rose-colored glasses. . I don't know what the point of 

this

 ridiculous dream is, but I know perfectly well that nothing here is real. Apologies, penences, and injuries included.""


 


""Dammit, Granger, it is!"" he snarled. 


 


""Am I supposed to believe that the 

real

 Malfoy snogged me, too? That he has tried to come on to me? I know we're married, but I'm not stupid enough to believe he would ever be kind about it, having lovely snogs in a garden.""


 


""Fuck, yes. I didn't realize it was really you. I didn't know I was me either. I mean, I did, but I thought it was a dream, too,"" he said. Hermione was annoyed by how frantic he was acting. Like her own mind was trying to make her feel pity for him of all people.


 


""So if you were actually real and if you had realized I was actually real, you wouldn't have done those things?"" she asked, rolling her eyes again.


 


""Of course not!"" he cried, ""I don't want to do any of that now. All I want is for you to see that this is real.""


 


""I was unaware that my self esteem was this low,"" she said, standing and starting toward her pathway. Hermione was ready to be done here. ""But I suppose a war will do that to you. I'm going home. Have a terrible night... or day.. Or whatever. You don't even exist anyway.""


 


""Stop!"" Malfoy yelled at her, darting forward and grabbing her arm. ""You can't just leave. You 

have

 to understand what's going on.""


 


Hermione turned toward him, irritation shooting through her. ""I don't know why we're having this conversation, but I'm not putting up with it."" Raising her wand, she hit him with a light Knockback Jinx. He didn't fall back very far since it had been so weak and he had been holding onto her, but Malfoy still hopped up looking furious.


 


""You bitch!"" he screamed. ""You hurt me! You 

keep 

hurting me. You can't reject the bond, Hermione."" 


 


Malfoy was rapidly advancing on her. That was more like it. This Malfoy was much more believable. 


 


She didn't waste time arguing, just hit him with another Knockback Jinx. He stumbled and fell as it blew him back.


 


""You think you're the only one who's been hurt, Malfoy? I still don't know all the ways you hurt me, just that they happened! And that they're still happening. Every fucking day, Malfoy, I'm reminded of how much you've hurt me. So yes, I 

can

 reject you. And you already know I would rip this bond out if I could. Stay away from me.""


 


This time, as she started away, she could see him trying to stand and failing, his ankle seemingly unable to support his weight. Good, he wouldn't be able to follow her again!


 


His voice followed her though, talking more nonsense. ""It isn't me who's hurting you, Granger. You're the one doing this. You 

have

 to accept the bond or it will keep hurting us both. Please...""


 


She let his words roll over her as she made her way out of their clearing. Only the 'please' gave her pause. It was so very unlike him. She had to remind herself, again, that this was just her trying to tell herself something. Maybe her mind wanted her to accept the bond for some reason. Maybe that's what this whole thing was about? She turned the questions over and over in her mind as she walked aimlessly through the garden until she woke.


 


****************


 


Draco got out of bed gingerly. Everything ached. His ankle was throbbing. Reaching to his wand on the bedside table, he cast a quick healing spell. He groaned at his ineptitude when he inspected the ankle. He would be able to fake a normal gait briefly, but it was going to hurt like hell. Still, that injury was much better than last night. Just the ache of being blasted back multiple times. And the intensely painful hollow feeling from her telling him she would tear the bond out if she could.


 


He had slept long enough that the Dreamless Sleep he knew they had given him must have worn off. When he arrived in the rose garden, he had considered not seeking her out since it would undoubtedly end in pain, but he was drawn. Knowing it was really her... He wouldn't admit it to anyone else, but he wanted to see her, to spend time with her, Merlin, to 

touch

 her even more now.


 


So he had gone. And he had tried to tell her. Even while pushing her, Draco had known he shouldn't be doing it. The witch just made him so furious. She was so sure she was right, even when arguing with what she thought was a figment of her own imagination. He dismissed the fact that he had assumed the same until his injuries proved otherwise. And that it made perfect sense to think you're right versus a dark part of your own consciousness. 


 


Now that he knew the truth, he just felt desperate for her to see it, too. Draco's Slytherin mind had pointed out that he could do something to 

her

, hurt Hermione in some way that she would take back with her into the real world. His whole being rebelled at the thought. Even considering it again made him seize up for a moment, unable to move and helpless to the waves of pain when he tried to breathe.


 


Banishing the thought, Draco worked to calm himself. He needed to be able to walk into the lab and act normal so that Blaise would let him start working today. There wouldn't be a lot of new things to learn until his magic was better, but he could make potions, simple things like pain and blood replenishing potions, as well as learning and practicing more complicated potions like the contraceptive and Skelegro. Plenty of others, he was sure, too. 


 


Draco actually loved potions, so he was hoping that some of Blaise's medical texts would include ones he didn't know at all. Or perhaps he could even experiment with some. He knew the contraceptive potion was necessary daily, but what if it could last a week or a month? That kind of protection would be so much more helpful to the women here in case he or Blaise couldn't get to them every day.


 


When he walked into the lab a little while later, Blaise was already there, leaning heavily on one of the tables as he stirred a cauldron. Draco leaned against the door, shifting his weight off the throbbing ankle, as he observed his friend. There were black circles under Blaise's eyes and he looked ready to fall over from the exhaustion of making it this far from his bed. Draco had no idea how he had managed to drag himself through his rounds yesterday or, worse, how he was supposed to do it again today. 


 


""Are you sure I can't come with you today?"" he asked before he could think better of it. He wouldn't have been able to do all that walking with his ankle in the shape it was in.


 


Blaise startled, looking up at his friend before smiling wearily. ""I know you want to start your training as soon as possible, but your magic isn't ready.""


 


""I do want to start when you'll let me, but I meant more as just an assistant. Watch what you do, carry stuff. Whatever I could do to help,"" Draco explained.


 


""If I didn't know better, I would think that Lord Malfoy is worried about a peasant and wants to look out for him,"" Blaise teased, deflecting the very real concerns Draco had.


 


He felt weird, too. It was a huge departure from the way they had each been raised, being this open and vulnerable with each other. He, Blaise, and Theo had already been far more emotional in each other's presence over the last few years than their parents would have been okay with if they had known. But now? Draco was sometimes a little afraid of how all their boundaries had crumbled. They had seen too much, experienced too much together. He would do anything for Blaise, including walk around like a servant to make sure he didn't overdo it.


 


""Can't let the peasant render himself useless by collapsing,"" Draco replied haughtily.


 


A smile quirked on Blaise's lips. ""I appreciate it, but I need you here brewing."" He beckoned Draco closer and slid the page of instructions toward him.


 


""Seriously, Blaise, I don't think you should-""


 


""I'm the Healer here, Drake. I need you to do what I tell you to do,"" Blaise's voice was firm. ""Now, once your magic is back, we'll start learning diagnostics and how to read them. Next will be simple spells and wound treatment. I'm confident the Dark Lord will provide us with plenty of samples for you to work on,"" he said darkly.


 


""No doubt,"" Draco snorted. 


 


""For today, I need you to focus on making as many contraceptive and blood replenishing potions as possible. They complement each other during the brewing process - the stirring needed works opposite of each other.""


 


Draco nodded absentmindedly, already absorbed in the potions. The gentle work of prepping, adding, and stirring ingredients together made him calmer, always had. It was easier to regulate his painful breaths in time with what he was doing as well. He didn't even notice when Blaise made his way out, a smile on his face that his friend had come so far.


 


*************************


 


Hermione was enjoying her solitude now that she had it. Theo had been giving her space - or perhaps was just too afraid of her - since the revelation he had dropped on her. Harry had been physically and magically exhausted when he returned from the Heart of the Manor the night before. She wasn't sure where he was this morning. Perhaps Andromeda had him trapped in bed somewhere, still angrily telling him off. 


 


They had both been quite upset with him when they realized he had slipped out of the room to hunt by himself. Truly, Hermione knew she should have expected it since it was probably the Harry-est decision he could have made. It was just lucky that Theo had quietly followed him and sat waiting across from the spot in the wall where he said Harry had disappeared. If he hadn't Hermione knew she would have lost her mind with worry.


 


Theo was a puzzle she was determined not to dwell on. She knew Harry wanted to trust him, felt drawn to him in some way she didn't understand. But Hermione had to admit how helpful he had been with all of this information about the wards and how to work out a ritual to strengthen them. 


 


Setting Theo aside, she dug back into the problem with the warding. The ritual they were fleshing out to bring the castle itself back to its original glory as a magical stronghold was extremely complex. It would be time-consuming to figure it out, to find things they needed, to find people willing to help perform it. She wasn't even sure what all it would require yet and she was certain of those things. It was also very likely that it would have a particular time it would need to be performed. That might be the next day, the next full moon, or three seasons from now. The arithmancy involved was mind-boggling and impossible to complete without all of the factors. 


 


But it had already been a ludicrous amount of time for the Order to be using that castle as headquarters with walls still down. Yes, it was under the Fidelius, but the Death Eaters had already broken through the floo system once despite the charm, in a far smaller place to hide no less, and that made Hermione inclined not to trust it. 


 


She wanted to make a temporary warding system that could later be tied into the larger, more permanent wards. Perhaps as a wartime extension that could be activated or perhaps they would remain permanent. Something like what McGonagall had done with the statues and suits of armor throughout the castle. Hermione made herself a note to check with Minerva on how she was able to make the spell effect them all at once - if they had been tied to the original wards then she might be able to inspect them for clues of how it was done before. She also needed to ask if those previously inanimate creations had returned to their spots in the castle or if they would have to be replaced. They were an excellent bit of extra protection that could be useful again in the future. 


 


Turning her attention back to the wards themselves, Hermione considered what they needed to do. During war, an attack on a ward should include some kind of alarm. Perhaps it could even offer information about the kind of attack? At least to certain people keyed to the wards? It would be helpful, too, if the wards did not simply keep the enemy out, but repelled them in some way. Could they make a small explosion of some sort? That could hurt people desperate for the castle's protection, though, and that certainly wasn't what they wanted. Maybe they could key everyone who was supposed to be there to the wards so they wouldn't be harmed? Too much room for error. Perhaps a ward could just send people somewhere else? That way they weren't hurt, but were no longer a threat. She would need to discuss it with Theo.


 


She couldn't decide if she was happy or sad when the boy in question poked his head in at that moment. Until now, she had essentially been able to ignore him. But Harry was with him and so she smiled at their entrance, making sure her eyes stayed with her brother. 


 


Harry looked between them warily. Hermione knew he hadn't really been talking to the other boy, spending as much of his time as possible with Dean and some of the recruits instead, so she was a little curious what brought them together this morning. Hermione was conflicted about him. She desperately wanted to talk about the warding with him, but she hadn't forgiven him by any means and didn't particularly want him near her. 


 


""Hey Mione,"" Harry said. ""I thought it was time I checked on you. Are you overworking yourself?""


 


She rolled her eyes. ""Of course not. I'm only allowed to sit here and read and take notes!""


 


Harry laughed. ""You say that like those aren't your favorite things to do.""


 


""That isn't the point!"" she insisted. ""You're off having adventures and becoming a Lord without me while I just sit and do research.""


 


""I didn't 

want

 to leave you out,"" Harry said. ""I just felt like I had to go look at that moment, you know?"" He stared at her imploringly. She knew he just wanted her to understand and say it was okay. 


 


""I know how you are, Harry James,"" she admonished with a smile and a fond shake of her head. ""I do still expect a full report of what was in the Heart, though.""


 


""Of course,"" he promised. ""I don't want to just tell you about it! As soon as Andromeda will let you up, I want to show you!""


 


She was just about to express her excitement when Theo spoke up for the first time. ""Unless she is your sister by blood, the room won't allow her in."" Both of their faces must have fallen because he quickly added, ""But there's a ritual! Andromeda would probably know it.""


 


""Thank you,"" Harry said. ""We will ask her about it.""


 


Deciding Hogwarts' needs were more important than her desire to stay away, Hermione said, ""Theo. Speaking of rituals, it's good that you're here. I'm working on the problem with the wards again.""


 


""I get that we need wards to keep Tom's troops out, but we already have some around the perimeter that weren't this big of a deal. I assume we could put up more like that around the castle itself. Why do we need a big ritual for it?"" Harry asked, pushing up his glasses and leaning in. 


 


Hermione smiled happily. She was shocked by how much more interested he seemed in academics when Ron wasn't around. He would always prefer Quidditch and jokes, but Harry had a strong mind when he was willing to use it. She bit her lip, trying to figure out the simplest way to explain. 


 


""As you say, the basic function of a ward is to keep something or someone out, which the spells around the grounds are doing. I used similar warding spells, as many as I could find, layered over each other when we were on the run. Those were the lowest level of warding, though, depending on which spell in particular we're discussing.""


 


""Well, not the very lowest, but close,"" Theo jumped in. Hermione pursed her lips together, but couldn't fault what he had to say as he continued, ""Personal ward spells are the first and easiest possibility if you need immediate protection. Technically, the very first ward you ever learn is 

Protego

. As you know, it will stop a spell, maybe two if you put enough power behind it.""


 


""Any more than that and it collapses,"" Harry said, letting them know he was paying attention and understood.


 


""Exactly,"" Hermione agreed. ""So that's the base. Then wards like we did in the forest are after that. You don't have to personally expend magical energy to hold them in place once they've been cast. They hold themselves, but are still very temporary.""


 


""Some are even capable of moving around an object, if you know the right incantations,"" Theo added, but then squirmed down in his chair at the look Hermione shot his way.


 


With a huff and then a deep breath in, Hermione said, ""I would very much like to know more about that in the future, Theo. For now, those temporary wards can only cover a small area and by themselves function much like a 

Protego

. They're a little stronger, can take a few more or stronger hits, but not by a lot. They were more about giving us time to get away than truly being something we could sit comfortably behind if anyone had known we were there.""


 


Harry's eyes had widened a bit. ""I'm surprised we didn't get caught if that's all they do.""


 


""That's why we were layering so many spells,"" Hermione told him. ""There was a ward, of course, but also separate spells to make that ward and everything within it invisible, silent, and even keep our scents hidden. The shield alone would not have kept us safe.""


 


""I had forgotten how long it always took for you to put them up each evening, and how tired you were after."" Harry shared a long look of appreciation with her. Herminoe smiled. Every now and then it was nice to remember that Harry knew how many times and all the different ways she had saved them all, and even nicer for him to acknowledge it in front of someone. She felt her cheeks go a little pink.


 


""So there's that kind of smaller ward,"" Theo pulled them back on topic. ""Then there are larger ones - the sort that are meant to protect an entire building. Some are simple, nothing more than a barrier that sets off an alarm somewhere when it's crossed. Others are extremely complex and designed to hold against an army. The more complicated a ward is, the more you have to use to anchor it if you wish for it to hold.""


 


""What do you mean by anchoring?"" Harry asked. 


 


""For most purposes, runes are used. The specific runes, how many you use, what combination they're in, how close together they are, how they are drawn or carved or whatever, and what you put them on makes a huge impact on the strength of the ward,"" Hermione explained.


 


""The simple ones are just a rune or two drawn on the ground around a rough perimeter. For a building, you would draw them on the walls,"" Theo continued the explanation as smoothly as though the two of them had choreographed the whole lecture.


 


Harry was watching them with a look of fascination as Hermione continued, ""More complex wards require far more effort. Multiple runes working together, the rune sequence repeated every few feet, carved into stone-""


 


""Or drawn with blood, like the purebloods use to protect their ancestral Manors, like mine and even like this one,"" Theo added.


 


""But Hogwarts needs even more than that. Because the wards aren't just about shielding. They're not really just wards,"" Hermione said, biting her lip. She wasn't sure if Harry would believe the next part or not. ""You know some areas, like the Room of Requirement, respond to the people in the castle, their wants and sometimes even unspoken needs.""


 


Harry nodded. He had lots of experience with that room, so she had expected it would be the easiest to help him understand.


 


""Have you ever noticed other parts of the castle behaving in an odd way?"" Theo asked, more quietly now. 


 


""Odder than all the moving staircases and the like?"" Harry asked with an eye roll. Truly, the whole castle was odd.


 


Theo smiled though neither she nor Harry sent one back to him. ""Yes, there are odder things than that, though the moving stairs can sometimes be quite helpful when the need is urgent,' he said.


 


Hermione had a feeling he was about to launch into a recitation of odd things that could happen but she really needed them to move on to the possibilities she had come up with. ""From what they wrote in the books they left behind, the founders used rituals along with practically every power enhancer possible to create the original wards for Hogwarts. The nature of those wards is the foundation of the castle's sentience. It's the foundation of the castle's 

magic.

""


 


""Can't you just do whatever ritual they did?"" Harry suggested.


 


""If they had written it down, we could,"" Hermione replied with a frustrated huff.


 


""It makes sense,"" Theo offered cautiously. ""A ritual like that, if anyone knew how it was done, could be altered to steal the magic of the castle away from its inhabitants. I suspect that the founders' own magic was tied in. Merlin, it may even still be there.""


 


""If it hasn't drained out,"" Hermione said, trying not to let the panic rise. ""The thing is, Harry, if we don't figure out this ritual, Hogwarts will lose everything that makes it the safe, sacred place that it is. And I know it may not feel very sacred sometimes, with everything that goes on with a castle full of teenagers, but it

 is

.""


 


Theo laughed, but the look she sent him quelled him. He nodded instead and said, ""It was created for such behaviors, truly. They're all part of the learning experience.""


 


""So you have to create a ritual from scratch to rival the one the four founders did?"" Harry asked, eyes round.


 


""Yes,"" Theo confirmed.


 


""And we can do it! We will do it. But Theo, I have some thoughts on a more temporary solution - something to stop the leak of magic and allow the walls to be rebuilt, plus offer more wartime uses.""


 


Theo cocked his head at her. ""Do tell,"" he invited.


 


""I think we could come up with a small ritual. It would invoke very specific ward properties,"" she explained.


 


""But without the need to call the sentience of the castle,"" Theo said wonderingly. ""That's brilliant.""


 


""If we do it properly, we can link the old rune stones within the walls - including the new ones - so that the magic can be pulled into the final ritual without needing to wait to rebuild the walls,"" Hermione continued.


 


""Thank Merlin,"" Theo and Harry breathed, almost in sync.


 


""What does it mean that this first ritual wouldn't use the sentience of the castle?"" Harry asked.


 


""Just that the things the ward is capable of would be exactly what we tell it to do. It wouldn't sense intent or make any judgement calls,"" Theo explained.


 


""But it would still require a ritual,"" Harry stated for confirmation.


 


""To be as powerful as we need it to be, yes,"" Hermione agreed. 


 


Theo sat down at the table to look over the notes she had most recently made. Hermione strongly considered stopping him, but she knew his opinion would be invaluable. Her eyes met Harry's and she gave a nod that it was okay.


 


***********************


 


It looked like Theo was about to say something when Andromeda swept into the room. ""Harry,"" she said in greeting. In a more irritated tone, she added, ""Theo.""


 


""I'm sorry, Andromeda,"" he said, hanging his head. His voice was very small with his explanation. ""I meant to bring him down, but I don't think he wanted to come with me. And he did need to check on Hermione, too.""


 


Andromeda nodded and turned to Harry. ""It's dinner time. Why aren't you in the Hall?""


 


Confused, he responded, ""Why would I be in the hallway?""


 


""The Great Hall of the manor, dear,"" Andromeda said with a smirk.


 


Harry's brows came together as he tried to figure out what she was talking about. When she commanded him to follow her, Andromeda led them - Harry with his arm around Hermione despite her protests and Theo behind them, to the dining room. Only, as she had suggested, the room that was there now was quite different. It wasn't as huge as the Grand Hall in Hogwarts, but it was far beyond the small dining room Harry knew the house had when they arrived. 


 


Staring about in wonder, he asked ""How did this happen?""


 


""The manor responded to the needs of its Lord,"" Hermione said, wonder in her voice.


 


The room felt like it was beckoning him inside. He would normally have said he was imagining things, but clearly the manor was in fact responding to him, so perhaps that wasn't such a crazy idea. As they walked in, the sconces flared along the walls and all the recruits inside turned to look at them. 


 


Blue and gold banners decorated the walls, with a coat of arms that must be his family's if this was truly Potter Manor. There were only three tables in the room, but each was quite long. One down each side and then a head table at the front. It wasn't raised or anything, which Harry was immensely thankful for, but it was clear that this table was for the Lord of the Manor. 

Him.

 


 


""How? What am I supposed to do?"" 


 


""You go in and sit at the head table for each meal. For the time being, these are your people. It's not really common these days for a Lord to actually have liegemen, but the Manor is adapting to the circumstances.""


 


""They're not my 

liegemen

,"" Harry declared. ""I'm just the same as all of them and I won't sit at a table in front of them and act like I'm better."" He felt silly, but he turned to the room and spoke clearly if somewhat quietly. ""This isn't the sort of Great Hall I wish to have. My table should be with everyone else's.""


 


Nothing changed and Harry grimaced a bit. Andromeda began laughing and he heard Theo snort behind him. 


 


""Has it ever changed before while you were looking at it?"" she asked.


 


""No,"" Harry said, realizing the truth of it as he answered. Of course the room wouldn't change right now. If it did at all, it would be while they were all out of the area. ""Wait - does this mean that the Manor here is sentient like Hogwarts?""


 


Andromeda nodded. ""It is actually quite rare to have such a sentient Manor, but the Potter family, and maybe even the Peverells before them, put much effort into encouraging it over the centuries. It will become more responsive as it gets to know you.""


 


""How do you know all of this?"" Harry asked. He had only met Andromeda recently. How could she know so much about his family?


 


""My Aunt Dorea was Fleamont's sister-in-law. The two families were quite close and I spent as much time with Aunt Dorea as I could so I got to know them quite well. I was so jealous when they basically adopted Sirius. It was silly."" Andromeda paused for a moment, looking far away. ""When the war was just beginning, we were already so scared. I was a disgraced Black, so I knew the rumblings that had been going on as I grew up. We knew what was coming. Ted was talking about going on the run. We were trying to decide if Dora and I were safe or not. It was so hard to know. Monty came to me and asked if our family would 'keep them company' here at the Manor.""


 


""How long did you live here?"" Hermione asked, clearly drawn in by the story.


 


""Until the war was over. When they died of dragon pox, Ted and I weren't sure where we would go, but James told us to stay here until the war was over. So we did. I love this place, though it looks different now. It changes more than you realize."" There was a sadness in her face as she looked around.


 


""I think my dad would be glad you spent that time here, and that you're here to guide me now.""


 


Andromeda smiled as she made her way regally to the table at the end of the hall. Harry sped to catch up with her. ""What are you doing? I told the Manor I didn't want this table,"" Harry whispered.


 


""And I told you I would teach you how to be a Lord. You said there was a book that explained Lord Potter's duties. Did it say nothing about appearing before your people? Starting the meal? Being gracious and accommodating?"" she asked, arching her eyebrow.


 


""Well... yes, it did. But that was in the really old part,"" he grumbled.


 


""Humor me, dear. And the Manor. For a night or two it won't kill you and it will improve the morale among the recruits.""


 


Harry wrinkled his brow. ""The recruits aren't upset about anything right now.""


 


""Not about anything happening right here,"" Andromeda said, ""But these are people who have been out in the world with the war going on around them. They're exhausted and scared and they aren't sure if they're going to save the world or if they've signed their own death warrants. Seeing you in charge will do them a world of good.""


 


""Why would I be able to-""


 


""The magic of a place like this can influence just as surely as you can yourself, but magnified. It is fueled by you, but it is large and strong and can reach out to almost everyone inside if they feel connected,"" Andromeda explained.


 


Harry blinked. ""That's unbelievable."" He felt shock at the magnitude of everything he was learning today. And they weren't even through dinner yet. Behind him, he could hear Theo and Hermione murmuring together about wards. No matter how angry she was with him, Harry knew she couldn't walk away from all the information he would be able to provide. He breathed a sigh of relief as he smiled around at everyone - friends and recruits who were becoming friends - and tucked into his dinner.


 


*********************


 


Charlie watched Draco from the doorway of the lab for several long minutes before he said anything. He observed the limp, the exhaustion, the way the boy held his chest and tried to breathe normally as he moved from cauldron to cauldron, stirring and adding things. If Charlie weren't just as bad himself, he would have complained that Draco was clearly too stubborn to stop working for his own good. 


 


""It happened again, didn't it?"" he finally asked.


 


Draco's head snapped up and he dropped his hand away from his chest. ""What are you talking about?"" he demanded, the snooty, mean tone he adopted telling Charlie he had startled his friend.


 


""How did you slip it past Blaise?"" he wondered aloud. ""No blood this time?""


 


""No,"" Draco huffed after a moment. ""Mostly just knockback jinxes and rejection."" He rubbed at his chest again and concentrated on a deep breath.


 


""I guess the Dreamless Sleep didn't work,"" Charlie said.


 


""I think it did, actually,"" Draco replied. ""Just didn't last long enough. The time with her was short. I mostly just tried to make her believe it was real until she lost her temper with me.""


 


Charlie sighed. He didn't blame the girl. If someone showed up in his dreams and said they were real, he wouldn't believe them either. He had some thoughts forming about how to intervene, but... he would need a real hideout after. 


 


Blaise was going to kill him, but they couldn't wait any longer. Charlie needed to take his place in the guard and Draco needed help communicating. For those two things to happen, they had to have their room. 


 


""Are those potions at a point you can leave them alone for a while?"" he asked, almost casually.


 


Draco looked up at him with slightly narrowed eyes. ""Yes. I just need to bottle up this contraceptive and the others need to simmer for a few hours.""


 


""Perfect,"" Charlie said, moving to help with the bottling process.


 


""What are we doing?"" Draco asked.


 


""Making our room,"" Charlie informed him.


 


His hand stilled. ""Are you sure that's wise? My magic is no different than it was yesterday. Maybe a little worse.""


 


""Do you think it's going to improve as you keep having these dreams?"" Charlie asked.


 


Draco sucked in air and leaned against the table for a moment before shaking his head no.


 


""We need to do it now before something happens and you get worse. I have a plan to get in touch with her, but the room has to be available.""


 


""What could you possibly-""


 


""No way. If I tell you, you'll feel obligated to tell Blaise and he'll murder me himself to keep me from doing it,"" Charlie said with a lopsided grin.


 


That earned him an eyeroll, but Charlie didn't mind. He knew Draco was at least grudgingly accepting of... whatever was happening between Blaise and himself. Sometimes he thought the blond actually approved of the possibility. If only he and Blaise were as confident as that. Charlie wanted to be, Merlin knew he was in too deep emotionally to back out now. The part he couldn't handle, that made him queasy to think about, was pushing forward physically. He wanted that, too. Desperately. But the idea of it actually happening was terrifying and... it just wasn't fair to Blaise. 


 


""That's all of the potion,"" Draco declared. ""Now what are we doing?""


 


Charlie finished putting the potions carefully away in one cabinet, then turned and began levitating the other, the one full of ingredients, away from it's spot in front of his hidden niche. He set the cabinet down in such a way that it was blocking the door. 


 


When Draco could walk up and touch the tiny area, Charlie said, ""We need to turn that into a doorway to a room. It won't be a big room - just enough for two beds with maybe a foot or two between them. That will be enough. We could maybe expand it later, if your magic is ever at full strength, or possibly with all three of us working together.""


 


Running one hand down the shadowed back of the niche, Draco nodded. ""Let's do it. I would feel a lot safer with somewhere to go that they can't find.""


 


Charlie stepped forward, touching his magic to the stone of the wall. ""I'll guide us, just link your magic in with mine and think about the room we're making.""


 


As he felt the surge of magic from Draco, Charlie began chanting the spells to enlarge a space. He had the clear vision of what he intended to make, just as you were supposed to. He felt sweat break out across his brow. This would have been easier if Draco were at full power, but it had to be done, he reminded himself. As the room began to expand, he saw Draco lean hard against the wall. 


 


Suddenly, there was a larger burst of magic and Charlie utterly lost control of the spell. He felt dizzy with power. His knees hurt as he hit the shaking floor. Fear flooded him that there was no way all this movement wouldn't be noticed. Charlie couldn't stand, but he cut the spell off with a muttered 

Cessare

 before blacking out.


 


Draco was hovering over him when Charlie's eyes opened. ""You scared me.""


 


""This room scared me,"" he groaned back. ""Are we found out yet?""


 


""No,"" Draco said, pride in his voice. ""They won't find us here. And I don't think anyone but us felt the shaking.""


 


""How the hell would they not feel it?"" Charlie said, slowly pulling himself off the floor. 


 


Then he gasped as he looked around. The room they were in was huge, more of a suite than a room. It had plenty of space for beds. In fact, there were already two four posters, queen size at least, with a wall between them though they were still open to the main room. There was a sofa and three large, comfy looking chairs around a low table. Looking across, there was a small dining set and perhaps a kitchen area. There were a number of doors. One in each of the bedroom areas logically might lead to closets? The other two he wasn't sure, though presumably one was the way out.


 


""I had forgotten,"" Draco said quietly. ""I'm the Lord here. The Manor responds to me. I handed the wards partially to the Dark Lord, but it didn't change who is in charge of the estate.""


 


""I had no idea that was even possible,"" Charlie said, still in awe. ""How did it take this form?""


 


""I think it was because I was thinking about what I 

wish

 we could have. And then I touched the wall and it just... it did it,"" Draco told him, excitement and pride in his voice.


 


""Where do the doors lead?"" he asked.


 


Draco helped him up and gave him a tour. The bedrooms did indeed have closets. One of the other doors was a luxurious loo, with a separate shower and bathtub. The last door was the way out, though the door was purely decorative for those who were meant to come in. You could walk straight through it and be in the solid blackness of the niche behind the cabinet. Draco had already moved it back in place. 


 


They were utterly hidden, safe, and able to live in far more luxury than Charlie had dreamed of. He wasn't ashamed to realize he was crying. It had been so fucking long since he had felt safe. 


 


Ignoring his emotional response, Draco snarked, ""I think the bedrooms would have been enclosed if you hadn't cut off the spell when you did. Perhaps I'll fix that later.""


 


Charlie laughed. ""Aren't you pretty drained?"" he asked. ""I feel like I've been run over by a stampede of erumpents.""


 


""Honestly, no. I think working with the Manor actually helped me. Blaise will have to run his diagnostics to confirm it, but I feel a lot better. Just the pain here left,"" he said, patting his chest. ""But I feel energized, at least.""


 


Moving slowly, disbelief thrumming through his body, Charlie finally lowered himself into one of the chairs, finding it fully as comfy as it looked. This felt like hope and possibility. It felt like the world might be okay someday after all.


What do you think Charlie has planned? 

Did all the warding stuff make sense? 

What do you think of the sentient aspect of certain magical buildings, Hogwarts and ancestral Manors like these? Obviously they're going to exist in my world, but I would love to hear any headcanons about this kind of stuff.

Trigger Warning: Discussion of rape occurs in the third scene. 

I was so excited to write this chapter that I had it done within days of the last post despite it being my busy work week! So happy unexpected one week post!

Omnenomnom, my forever alpha, helped me so much this chapter with making sure we built tension properly in one part and that things in the last part were discussed without a rape apologist attitude despite the perspectives of the story. I appreciate her help so much.

Monday, June 8th; morning


 


Draco gasped as he woke up to someone shaking him. It took his eyes a moment to focus on the red hair above him and realize the large calloused hands were busy bandaging up his arm where Hermione had just hit it with a slicing hex moments before in the Rose Garden. 


 


""Do you know how fucking weird it is to watch wounds appear on your body while nothing is happening here?"" Charlie asked as he worked.


 


""Not any weirder than you watching me sleep,"" Draco smirked.


 


Charlie laughed quietly. ""Well, at least tonight's garden party didn't dull your tongue much.""


 


""I think you shaking me like that brought me out before she could do much damage. You pulled me out right before a curse would have hit. I don't know, of course, but I think it was a pretty nasty one,"" Draco admitted.


 


""What did you do to her tonight?"" 


 


""Nothing!"" Draco insisted, wincing at his own loudness. He had a pounding headache. As soon as Charlie passed him a pain potion, he gratefully swigged it down. A relieved sigh rushed out of him before he began speaking again, ""Fine. I was just trying to make her see that it's real. She needs to know. This has to stop. It's... Charlie, if I show you something, do you swear not to tell Blaise?""


 


Charlie's eyebrows rose. Draco knew he wouldn't want to keep a secret from Blaise, but he needed to show someone. When Charlie nodded, Draco carefully squirmed out of his shirt. He knew the exact moment when Charlie noticed. 


 


The marks along his chest were a darker brown now. The center was just over his heart, looking almost like a hole. The darkness was starting to move outward along his veins and arteries. 


 


""What the fuck is that?"" Charlie gasped. 


 


""It's from the bond,"" Draco said confidently. ""They started out barely visible, sort of a light grey. I think it gets darker every time she says or does something that rejects the bond.""


 


Charlie swore for a moment, then stepped back. ""That just makes what I'm going to do even more important.""


 


""What are you doing?"" Draco asked. 


 


""Nothing that concerns you. As a matter of fact, 

you

 are taking a Dreamless Sleep and a Draught of Living Death. It is essential that you are in your coma when they come in here.""


 


""They who?"" Draco asked suspiciously.


 


""All the Death Eaters, I imagine. Not just here specifically, but they'll be tearing the Manor apart,"" Charlie said.


 


""Fuck. This is something dangerous then?"" Draco asked even though he already knew the answer.


 


""And incredibly stupid,"" Charlie agreed with a grin that didn't quite reach his eyes. ""If I... don't make it back, let Blaise know how much he meant to me, yeah?""


 


""You don't even know how much he means to you,"" Draco scoffed. Charlie blushed and Draco gave him a long look. Whatever this was, it must be insanely stupid if Charlie thought he might not be back. ""Are you-""


 


""Yes, I'm sure. This is important.""


 


""Fine. Am I supposed to make up flowery words for your lover boy?""


 


Charlie laughed. ""He would know 

those

 didn't come from me, but I guess you can embellish some.""


 


""I better not need to,"" Draco snarled at him. The more they talked about this, the possibility that Charlie might not come back was getting to him. 


 


""I'll keep that in mind,"" Charlie said. This time the smile did make it into his eyes. The man handed Draco the potions he needed then left without giving him time to say anything else.


 


""Make it back,"" Draco said quietly to the empty room before downing his potions and vanishing the vials before collapsing.


 


****************


 


Charlie made his way silently through the servant's halls until he had nearly transversed the manor. The spot he had scouted out was almost as far from the infirmary as he could get without going into Voldemort's wing. It was essential that no one could trace the magic back to his friends. 


 


Once he had gone as far as he could in the servant's hall, he pulled out a vial of transfiguration potion. It was risky, but he had picked a location in an unused room, nowhere close to the nearest servant's entrance. He didn't want Death Eaters automatically assuming and searching those halls, either. They needed those servant's halls to remain beneath the notice of those who might otherwise patrol them.


 


The potion tasted foul, as always, but he knew it was worth it. For a moment it felt like his whole body was trying to squeeze into nothing and then he was the little mouse again. He quickly skittered under the door and down a long hall. There were doors on either side, but he couldn't recall what was behind them this far off. 


 


It didn't matter anyway. His destination was an old dining room. It was considerably smaller than the one used downstairs and in an odd location for dining. He knew his upbringing hadn't prepared him for the intricacies of manor living, but he really couldn't understand the layout of this place sometimes. 


 


He shifted back into human form once he was there. Setting an unmarked vial on the table in preparation to down it the moment his Patronus left the room, he took a few deep breaths. He hoped to vanish it before the transformation began so they couldn't analyze it and know what he was using to move around the castle, but he had left it unmarked in case that wasn't possible. Sometimes the transformation hit faster than others and he and Draco hadn't figured out what in the brewing process changed that detail. 


 


Charlie was nervous. The Death Eaters couldn't cast Patronuses and none of the prisoners had access to their magic. Doing this was going to confirm that he was still hiding in the manor somewhere. That's not to mention the all out manhunt that would begin the moment it crossed the wards. A Patronus couldn't be stopped, but Voldemort would 

know

. But he didn't see any other way and he wasn't letting Draco die senselessly. Hermione Granger might genuinely hate the git, but she wouldn't kill him in cold blood. 


 


He steadied himself and cast the Patronus, giving it the message and instructions to find her. Saying the final words of the spell to send it away, he downed the potion and managed to vanish the vial just as his body began to squeeze down again. 


 


Tiny heart racing, mouse-Charlie darted out of the room and down the long hallway as an alarm was sounding through the Manor. He immediately had to hide in the shadows of a long tapestry as Death Eaters began to apparate to the dining room he had been in mere moments before. There were curses and angry shouts. 


 


Feet ran by him, doors flinging open all along the hall as people began searching. There were screams as they threw open some of the doors. Undoubtedly they had startled some of the wives or prisoners. 


 


Suddenly a feeling of terror slid up his little spine. Something mousy and instinctual took over and Charlie found himself scurrying away up the hall. 


 


Looking behind him, Charlie was nearly overwhelmed with fear and dread. That giant snake of Voldemort's was slthering after him, and it looked hungry. 


 


It's scales glimmered in the light behind them. How it had gotten between him and the dining room, he didn't know, but he was infinitely grateful it was there and not ahead of him. 


 


Would it be able to follow him into the servant's hall from here? There was a door, but he wasn't at all sure that would stop it. Another wave of terror almost overwhelmed him as Charlie realized he would never make it that far. 


 


The beast was close enough now that he could see the venom gleaming on its fangs, dripping off in its excitement for the kill. It was so high above him, it might as well have been a tower. The gigantic creature rose up, ready to strike. 


 


Helpless to make any other choice, Charlie darted through a random door under the feet of a Death Eater, rushing under a piece of furniture directly inside and praying hard. To his immense relief, the Death Eater - Rodolphus he thought - cursed the snake and slammed the door before it could come in. 


 


His relief ended the second he heard what the man said. 


 


""What the fuck are you doing, Bellatrix?""


 


Charlie froze. He should have recognized the room. And he did now that he was looking at it. His human fear spiked and he had to squish it down into this tiny body so he wouldn't explode into human form. 


 


""I want to be sure I look my best,"" she replied. Charlie could see her feet. She was sitting at her dressing table. 


 


A growl sounded from Rodolphus, as Charlie was now certain it was him. ""You are supposed to be searching every square inch of this fucking manor so we don't end up on the wrong end of the cruciatus again. Or worse!""


 


It was cathartic to know that they had been tortured. Charlie hoped it was for losing him. 


 


""I'll join the search in a moment, darling,"" Bellatrix said the last word with contempt before giggling like a school girl, ""But it's not every day one gets their pet back.""


 


There was silence for a moment though Charlie could barely register it as he fought the panic surging through him. Just because she said it didn't mean it was actually going to happen. 


 


Finally, Rodolphus exploded. ""You are getting dolled up for a fucking blood traitor?"" His voice sounded murderous. 


 


""Keep it down or someone will hear you and we'll be in trouble again,"" she said. She almost sounded sane. 


 


""We don't even know who the fuck it was sent that Patronus.""


 


So they knew for sure what had tripped the alarms on the wards. He had known they would, but somehow Charlie had still hoped it might escape their notice. 


 


Bellatrix laughed, sending Charlie's mouse body into convulsive shivers, and said, ""Don't be ridiculous. He's the only one still in the manor who can cast such a thing.""


 


Rodolphus growled, ""We don't know that he's still-""


 


The feet that had been sitting at her dressing table moved rapidly, fast enough that Charlie could sense her anger. 


 


""Of course it's him! I told you he would never leave me!"" Bellatrix screeched. 


 


""That's enough, you crazy bitch,"" Rodolphus swore at her. ""We're leaving this room and doing our very best to find him or whoever it was. I will not be tortured again for your delusional failures.""


 


""I am not-""


 


""Keep your fucking mouth shut about him and do your duty to the Dark Lord. You do remember that you're supposed to be in love with 

him

, don't you?""


 


With that, the man slammed the door open again, shoving Bellatrix out it as he followed her, blessedly closing it behind them. 


 


For long moments, Charlie couldn't tamp down the panic enough to move, his entire little body shaking helplessly. Finally, he forced himself from his hiding spot and raced across the room to the servant's door. Squirming under, he was soon on his way back up to the top floor and safety. 


 


He had to hide in the darkest shadows many times as he heard footsteps and voices near him. Once someone was actually in his hallway, though it was too dark to see who and they weren't speaking to give him any clues. 


 


When he finally made it to the infirmary, he was distressed to see it every bit as torn apart as he had told Draco it could be. They had even rolled his friend out of his bed, crushing it and leaving Draco surrounded by debris, small cuts along his face and arms. Charlie didn't dare do anything about them right now in case the other Death Eaters came back. 


 


He made his way into the lab. It had thankfully 

not 

been destroyed, though they had clearly been in it, too. Mouse-Charlie was under the cabinet and through the niche door as fast as he could go. 


 


Transforming back into himself, he sunk down into one of the chairs, exhausted, sweaty, and sobbing so hard he could barely think. But it was done. 


 


*************


 


Hermione was 

finally

 allowed outside. Andromeda was still sitting nearby to monitor her, but she was so thankful to be out in the fresh air, she didn't even care. Getting to watch everyone duel was just a bonus, though it still made her itchy to get down there and join them. 


 


Or maybe that was just the pregnancy itself. She was already experiencing bloating, constant nausea that made it hard to eat or even take her nutrition potions, a bad reaction to strong smells, having to go pee what seemed every 5 minutes, bouts of uncontrollable tears, erratic magical bursts, and suddenly sore, enormous breasts. Why not add this itchiness under her skin to be 

doing

 something?


 


She was glad to be outside, too, since it gave her the opportunity to dissolve her moody irritation with last night's dream. She had been fighting - again - with dream Malfoy. It felt good to take out her frustrations on him, even if her brain was trying to make her feel guilty about it. She knew violence was never the answer, but in a dream it hardly mattered. And it usually made her feel better, as long as he didn't disappear right before her curse could hit him. She had really wanted to see what it would do, too.


 


Theo sitting nearby but just out of her peripheral vision didn't make her feel any better. She was still angry with him, but also felt guilty that so much of her frustration was with him. Andromeda was right that he couldn't help what his friend had done. But he had hidden it.


 


Harry was working with one of the strongest recruits, an older man named Tobias, when a Patronus swooped between them causing Harry's 

bombarda

 to go astray and the man's expelliarmus to hit him dead on. 


 


The creature - a wolverine by the looks of it - stopped directly in front of Hermione. She was stunned for a moment until it began talking. 


 


""

Hermione, this is Charlie Weasley. I know we don't know each other well, but this is important enough that I am risking my life for it. Those dreams are real and you're fucking killing him. You have to accept the bond. Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini are on our side. I'm not safe, but I escaped Bellatrix and I'm okay. They're hiding me. I'll leave when I can break Tonks and a few others free. Don't send a message back - it would be my death and theirs. Tell my family I love them and I'll see them again when I can. Accept the bond

."" 


 


Then it was gone. There was a stunned silence. Hermione had no idea how to react to that. 


 


But Theo beside her let out a very uncharacteristic whoop of joy. There were tears in his eyes when she turned to him. ""They're alive and they're on our side,"" he said, answering the question she hadn't asked. Theo seemed embarrassed by his display of emotions, but he had tears on his cheeks now and a smile on his face. 


 


""Charlie?"" Harry asked, sounding uncertain. ""Do you really think that was his?""


 


""It was,"" Andromeda stated. When they all turned to her confused, she raised an eyebrow. ""He was my daughter's best friend and first love. I certainly recognize that wolverine and you cannot fake a Patronus.""


 


Hermione found her voice. ""They're hiding Charlie. I don't understand. Why would Malfoy help him?"" Even to herself she sounded a little lost. 


 


""People change, Dear,"" Andromeda said. ""Not often, perhaps. But it happens, especially when someone young has been influenced a certain way.""


 


""What did he mean about dreams being real and the bond?"" Harry asked curiously. 


 


Andromeda stepped in. ""Mr. Thomas,"" she called to Dean. ""Take over the training session. I need Harry's attention for the moment."" 


 


Turning back to them, she said, ""This won't be a fast discussion. It's time for some tea.""


 


Soon, Hermione found herself nervously sitting down with Andromeda, Harry, and Theo. She was grateful that by the time she sat, Harry already had a perfect cup of tea made for her and slid it over to her. 


 


A few sips were enough to calm her somewhat. She was taking deep breaths and trying to work through the implications of this new information. 


 


Harry tugged on her sleeve and made Hermione realize Theo had been speaking to her. ""He mentioned dreams? And something wrong with the bond?""


 


Hermione cleared her throat, trying to think. If the dreams were real... she groaned. ""He tried to tell me the last couple of nights, but I didn't believe him,"" she said, biting her lip. ""Malfoy. He kept saying I was hurting him and... I mean it sounded crazy.""


 


""You've been attacking him in your dreams?"" Harry asked. He almost sounded proud. 


 


""Well I didn't think I was attacking him for real! "" Hermione said defensively. She was appalled at what damage she might have done. 


 


""I mean the bastard deserves it,"" Harry soothed. ""You don't need to feel guilty about hurting that monster after what he did to you.""


 


""No!"" Hermione and Harry turned towards Theo, distracted by the outburst. Theo's face had become very serious. ""Dammit, Hermione. He doesn't deserve it! Or... maybe he does for all the shite he put you through in the past, but not for this part. Not for... he was imperiused!"" Theo managed to get out before anyone stopped him. 


 


""Imperiused?"" Hermione parroted, feeling shocked. ""During... that?""


 


""How can you be sure?"" Harry queried. 


 


""I...I saw it happen,"" Theo said through clenched teeth.


 


""You 

saw 

it happen?"" Hermione asked, feeling like she might hyperventilate. 


 


Theo flushed with shame. ""There were hundreds of them. If there had been anything I could do...""


 


""I think we need to hear r your story, Theo,"" Andromeda commanded. ""From the beginning this time.""


 


Now that the moment was finally here, Theo looked nervous and upset. ""I think it might be best to have something stronger than tea available,"" he suggested.


 


""That wouldn't be very fair to Mione,"" Harry pointed out and Theo paled.


 


""I'm sorry. I forgot.""


 


Andromeda called for her house elf anyway. ""Bring firewhiskey and witch's brew, please,"" she requested. 


 


""Witch's brew?"" Hermione asked, curiosity getting the best of her despite the serious subject they were supposed to be focused on.


 


There was an indulgent smile on Andromeda's lips as she explained, ""It has a calming effect similar to alcohol, but safe for pregnancy and breastfeeding. Magic is a beautiful thing.""


 


It certainly was. Hermione felt relieved that there was something she could have to mimic the soothing effects of alcohol the rest would enjoy. She looked around as they all paused, waiting for the house elf to return with the needed beverages. 


 


Hermione noticed that Theo was getting more nervous by the moment. He seemed to be trying to force his face into a perfect pureblood mask of indifference, but his anxiety kept leaking through again. His deep blue eyes looked worried and the way he was moving his lips just the tiniest bit made Hermione wonder if he might be rehearsing what he was about to say. While that could have made her angry, she had a feeling this was not a case of him making anything up, just nervously figuring out how to say what needed to be said. 


 


When the house elf appeared and left the stronger beverages with them, they all turned to Theo.


 


He cleared his throat and finally spoke. ""It was the day after the battle. The night, really, by the time Voldy called the Revel. He had been hurt, old Voldy, so everyone had gotten a reprieve the first night.""


 


There was a faraway look in Theo's eyes. Hermione would have preferred straight facts, but she realized that he needed to tell the story this way. She was impatient to know now that she realized how ignorant she had been to the truth, but she suspected he would get to what she needed to know faster if she let him go at his own pace.


 


""Revels are...they're horrible. They're for the entertainment of his worst followers. They do depraved things, usually to muggles and muggleborns, especially the women. They often do them in front of each other and cheer and come up with more horrid things to do. Sometimes - just once for me, but I know it happened more to Draco because he was marked - sometimes one of them would force us to participate. I...the time my father made me...I couldn't keep food down for four days after. The nightmares still..."" He shuddered and closed his eyes. 


 


When he looked up at her again, Hermione could see tears burning in his eyes. Theo leaned toward her and the look in his eyes was urgent as he said, ""He's like me, Hermione. I swear it. I know he has seemed awful in the past, but Draco's not one of them."" 


 


A thought flickered through Hermione's mind. Malfoy had been a terrible arsehole to all of them, but he was clearly good to his friends to inspire the kind of loyalty in Theo's eyes. He was silently begging her to understand, to give Malfoy a chance.


 


Looking away from her, he sighed, ""At the Revels, the Dark Lord also punishes the followers who have failed him. It's what happened to Draco. He had failed - his parents, too. The Dark Lord said-""


 


""Voldy or Tom here,"" Harry gently reminded him. ""We can't say the name he has given himself, but he's no Lord.""


 


Theo nodded. ""Voldy said Draco would take the punishment for them all - that he would be dead by the end of the night, but... The things they were going to do to him first... Please believe me that he was in an impossible position.""


 


Hermione stared at him, unsure of what she could say at this point. Her mind was flicking over the torture she had received at the Manor the first time, and how much worse it might be for a follower who had failed, who had turned their backs on their master's cause. Harry had told her about Narcissa's defection - that she had lied boldfaced to Voldemort about him being dead. There would have been no way for her to hide that after the battle. She gave a tiny nod and Theo looked relieved.


 


""Even knowing what would happen to him, he almost refused when Voldy declared he was going to marry you instead - that the punishment would be the continuation of their house but the end of their pureblood line."" 


 


""Some would consider that a fate worse than death,"" Andromeda said with a bitter, angry tone.


 


Theo nodded, ""His father certainly did. And he...I'm not sure what he thought, but he agreed to the marriage after... after you insisted."" He was looking right at her. 


 


""I what?"" Hermione was sure she hadn't heard that correctly.


 


""They wanted a ceremony that would bind you completely and Bellatrix suggested that a goblin blood ritual would be the best.""


 


""There were goblins there?"" Andromeda had an intense look on her face.


 


""No! Not really,"" Theo assured, though Hermione really didn't understand why it mattered so much. ""Professor Flitwick was there. And somehow Bellatrix knew he was able to perform the ritual they wanted.""


 


Andromeda looked furious, but nodded for him to continue.


 


""When Flitwick said he wouldn't do it, you stood up and said it was okay, Hermione. You made the Death Eaters all laugh because you told Voldy that you hated Draco with every fiber of your being, but you were going to marry him anyway because it was the right thing to do.""


 


Harry gave a mirthless laugh, ""That's our Hermione.""


 


""So it... it was consensual? I agreed to it?"" she asked, voice faint as she seemed to be losing her ability to take in air.


 


""To the marriage happening, yes. Under duress,"" Theo emphasized. ""I don't know if I would call it consent, but in that moment, you didn't blame Draco.""


 


""So we got married in a goblin blood ritual,"" Hermione said, taking a large sip of her witch's brew, then coughing at the unexpected taste. It was like a variety of berries somehow caught fire and then were smothered by honey and paprika. It didn't make sense, but it was disgusting and delicious at once.


 


Theo just nodded until her coughing subsided before continuing, ""He almost didn't say 'I do,' and the Dark Lord threatened to kill his mother. However Draco feels about muggleborns these days, he would never allow anything to happen to his mother. So it happened. But...but that's when it got bad.""


 


""That wasn't bad so far?"" Harry sputtered.


 


Biting his lip and looking very pale, Theo shook his head. ""No, that wasn't...it was nothing compared to the next part."" He took a very deep breath and looked deep into Hermione's eyes. ""I know it's frustrating, but I'm glad he obliviated you. I wish I could go back and take the memory from him. Please believe me, Hermione, no one should have to remember what happened. It was... one of the most brutal things I've seen them do."" 


 


He paused and stared off into the distance for a moment. Picking up the glass of firewhiskey the elf had set out for him, Theo drained it, poured another from the bottle, and drained it as well before beginning again. Harry reached out and took Hermione's hand, letting her cling to him.


 


""They wanted him to r-ra..."" Theo swallowed hard, ""take you in front of all of them, of his own free will. He refused, even tried to talk the damn Dark Lord out of it. He was so mortified and upset that he physically couldn't. So they gave him libido potions and imperiused him. Bellatrix did it. She's come up with some new way to work the spell so that the victim is fully aware of what they're doing while they're doing it, but still can't do anything about it.""


 


All three of them gasped. Hermione felt sick to her stomach and she knew it wasn't the baby to blame this time. That was a horrible violation, mental torture like she couldn't imagine and didn't want to.


 


And that wasn't the end. Theo continued, ""He... he wouldn't appreciate me telling you, but he cried like a baby through the whole thing. She told him he could speak his mind during and he just begged over and over not to do the things she was making him do. Draco offered to let her hurt him, to give up his fortune, anything to let it stop. But they wouldn't, not for hours. They made his parents and those of us who were his friends watch from the front. It was horrible. It was... I'm honestly surprised you lived through it.""


 


Theo looked at her again then. There were tears in his eyes that he was fighting not to let loose. Hermione didn't know what to feel. This boy had watched her being raped. But she wasn't angry at him as she had expected to be. It had clearly done something to him just to watch it. As much as she wanted to know everything that had happened to her, his emotional description of the whole thing made her just the tiniest bit glad she couldn't remember that night. 


 


""I don't know what happened after. When they finally took the two of you away, you were unconscious and he was close to. I... that's the last time I saw him. I'm a shite friend. I swore to him and Blaise I would never leave without them - we all did - that we'd get out together or not at all. But...they were about to mark me. I turned 17 a few days after I got here. They were going to do it on my birthday. I couldn't..."" Theo trailed off, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. 


 


""And then Zabini got Mione out somehow,"" Harry stated, a confirmation to pull Theo back on topic.


 


Theo paused. ""It wasn't that simple. It was a couple of days later before she escaped. The same morning they sent me away with the less important prisoners.""


 


""Do you know what happened to me in the time between?"" Hermione asked, wondering if she really wanted to know. She was almost relieved when he shook his head no. 


 


""After my father found me throwing up instead of participating in the rest of the Revel, he told me... the things he always does about what kind of son I am."" Theo's lips pressed together and he downed another glass of firewhiskey. No one knew what to say, so they didn't.


 


""Then he sent me out to guard duty again. I heard stories that they made up some kind of gladiator type arena and made Draco fight other Death Eaters to keep them from... having a turn."" He looked positively green when he forced those words out of his mouth. It left no doubt what he meant by that. 


 


""I heard about it even out with the guards because everyone was so impressed. They said Draco fought off three at once, but the stories had to be exaggerated. I know he's a good duelist, but there is no way he took on Greyback, Rowle, and Dolohov together and lived.""


 


""And I was-?"" Hermione asked tentatively. Was Draco the only one or could the baby belong to some random Death Eater? She felt green herself.


 


""I don't know. Not for sure. I know he got to keep you to himself. Rumors said you may have helped him with the fight. No one was really sure about the last part,"" Theo said apologetically. 


 


Hermione let out a deep breath she hadn't realized she was holding. The baby was Malfoy's. Then she almost started laughing. What bizarre state had she entered that this was a cause for relief?


 


""Is there anything else?"" Andromeda asked. 


 


Theo was quiet for a moment. ""Not that I can think of, but there may be more details I've forgotten or maybe suppressed.""


 


""Something worse than all that?"" Harry asked, incredulous. He had tears streaming down his face.


 


""I would put nothing past them,"" Theo said darkly. ""You can't understand the depth of their depravity unless you've had to live through it."" Hermione noticed the shadows in his eyes and wanted to hug him. 


 


Andromeda got to him first, murmuring something to the boy about not blaming himself and being brave for getting away.


 


Harry had another question for him once Theo had calmed. ""Do you think it was really Zabini who helped Hermione escape and obliviated her?""


 


Theo seemed to consider for a long moment. ""It's something that he would do. Both of those things. But he wouldn't have done it without Draco knowing. If Draco is still alive, they had a plan to make it look like he wasn't at fault.""


 


""Shite,"" Hermione whispered. ""I need to go to sleep and apologize.""


 


Andromeda snorted. ""Perhaps for hurting him the last few days, but no matter what happened to him in the past, you were still hurt. The things Theo has told us are tragic, but they do not change what was done to you.""


 


Hermione tried to think through that, but it was too much. She hated feeling like a victim, even if it was true. ""Well, I should go to Malfoy and talk about it, at least,"" she stubbornly insisted. ""I don't know... if I owe him an apology or not. I was hurt. I'm still living with the effects of what he did. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel now.""


 


""Child, perhaps some Dreamless Sleep would be more sensible for tonight. You have much to think on before facing your husband again,"" Andromeda said in a soothing tone.


 


Hermione took several deep breaths. ""I want to yell at you that he is not my husband, but it would be so childish. He 

is.

 A goblin blood ritual. Bill was right that there's no way out of it. If one of us dies, it'll probably kill the other.""


 


""It's good that he's on our side then,"" Harry said, rubbing her arm in support. 


 


""He's not on our side, Harry,"" Hermione corrected. ""Just not on theirs.""


 


""That's better than we could hope for. It's really the best case scenario, actually.""


 


Theo snorted. ""Except for the immense amount of danger he's in.""


 


""Isn't everyone?"" Harry responded.


 


As much as she wanted to, Hermione couldn't disagree with that. ""If you'll all excuse me,"" she said, ""I think I need to be alone for a while.""


 


""I will be checking on you in a little while, Mione,"" Harry told her.


 


She smiled and ruffled his hair. As she started to walk away, she turned back and looked into Theo's sapphire eyes. ""Thank you for telling me. I'm sorry we didn't let you before.""


 


""I understand,"" he replied. ""Just... please don't hate me for it. I know just letting it happen was wrong. I didn't know what else-""


 


""There was nothing else you could have done, Theo. I would never want anyone to die for me,"" Hermione told him before wandering off into the very real garden of the manor thinking hard about that other garden and the man she always sees in it.










Some of you guessed what Charlie was going to do. Quit knowing my story too well! lol Congrats on seeing right through me. :)

What did you think of all this? How do you think Hermione's going to process and deal with this new information?

I'm sorry it's a couple of days late. I've badly hurt my right wrist and typing with just my left (non-dominant) hand takes forever. Because of that and some other things, I will be taking a month break from this fic. I intend to update again by July 8th (the next day a KCAWS WIP Fest ends and I will need that last update to make my word count goal, so I'm pretty dedicated to having it up by then). 

Honestly, I'm at a weird place with this fic, but I don't want to make any decisions until I'm not in so much pain (from the wrist) and feeling overwhelmed (by the stuff I can't get done because of it). At this moment, knowing that the story I have in mind here will take at least 2-3 more years to write feels very daunting. So I'm considering streamlining it, cutting a ton of what I have planned, and making it more focused around Draco and Hermione rather than an epic that covers things going on in the war even if they're things other people are doing. But... then I really look at what I would be losing and it makes me sad because I would no longer be telling the story I want to tell. 

Anyway, enough moping from me. I hope you enjoy this one and stick around for the next despite the extra wait time.

Omnenomnom helped me a ton with this one, especially restructuring and rewriting parts of it so I didn't back myself into any corners where I can still go either direction with the story. I'm so far behind timewise that I didn't send it to my poor beta.

Monday, June 8th; evening


 


""You can't find him? We have an enemy loose in our Headquarters and all of my Death Eaters together can't locate him?"" Voldemort hissed, not letting up on the 

crucio

 he was using.


 


Tonks had seen him torture his minions plenty of times, but it was usually with a calm detachment. This was one of the times the monster was livid. Tonks shied away from the memory of the last time she remembered seeing him this angry. 


 


She and the other pets cowering around were relatively safe from his fury, but it was still terrifying to be in the same room with hatred so strong. Most of his Death Eaters looked like they might wet themselves at any moment. A few already had. Others looked like they might pass out from the anxiety of what he might do next.


 


This was the first time Tonks had been out of Rowle's room since the incident with Bellatrix. If Voldy hadn't required every single person in the Manor to be present, she doubted Rowle would have brought her out now either. He had been overprotective in a way she found vaguely comforting, almost to the point that she could count on him. Tonks shuddered at the thought that she was beginning to see Rowle in a positive light in any way. 


 


""Nagini tells me there was a mouse at the scene, but it escaped her when one of my black cloaks closed a door in her face. How dare you - any of you - close a door on my Nagini?"" he demanded, though the 

crucio

 was too strong for any of them to respond.


 


When he finally released it, a voice from the crowd said, ""Why is a mouse of interest when we were chasing an escaped prisoner?""


 


Everyone stepped away from Goyle Sr as the Dark Lord glared down at him. Rather than torturing him again, however, he put his hand to his temple as though he had a headache and explained very slowly. ""I know it's hard to find anything in your thick skull, but do you recall our rat friend?""


 


Even Goyle got a disgusted look on his face thinking of Wormtail. Then his eyes opened wide with a look of understanding. ""You think Pettigrew turned into a mouse now? I thought he was dead.""


 


Now Voldemort definitely looked like his head hurt. ""He 

is

 dead, you imbecile! But anyone could be an animagus.  A spy, an enemy, even that escaped blood traitor.""


 


""My pet is very smart, my Lord,"" Bellatrix said proudly. Her eyes looked slightly dreamy as she contemplated Charlie. She didn't even seem to notice the growl her husband was giving beside her, though Voldemort clearly did. 


 


""Your pet, Bellatrix?"" the Dark Lord said. His voice was now deceptively encouraging.


 


""Yes, my Lord. You must remember him. All the muscles and that red hair. You were quite fond of him,"" she gushed. ""And with good reason! He...""


 


Tonks found her mouth gaping open as Bellatrix continued to lovingly describe a man she was supposed to have seen as scum. Beside her, Tonks heard an evil little chuckle. When she looked up, she saw Dolohov kick the woman she knew had been Narcissa Malfoy as he whispered, ""It's unbecoming to laugh at the insanity that runs in your own veins, blood traitor."" 


 


The once Lady of the Manor was kneeling on the floor next to her husband's chair. While technically a wife, she was treated as another pet. Most of the wives kept here were. In a glaring contrast to her once regal robes, she was barely allowed a few strips of cloth to cover her body now. The hateful words her sister had carved into her skin were on display, some still weeping blood thanks to the cursed blade and Dolohov's rough handling.


 


This was her aunt, but the woman didn't spare her a glance, too wrapped up in her own pain and suffering. Or perhaps she still felt like she was too good to acknowledge her disowned older sister's child - if she even knew. Tonks contemplated whether it was possible she was unaware. Shaking her head at the senseless question, she focused back on the scene playing out in front of them.


 


Voldemort was saying, ""You have no rights to any pets, Bellatrix, since you lost two of them now. In fact, since you've made it quite clear how you feel about the blood traitor, it seems you may need some reminders that your... attachment to these creatures that are so far beneath us is inappropriate.""


 


There was sniggering throughout the hall. No one - good or evil - would be sad to see Bellatrix suffer. Then there was a growing rumble of conversation as everyone wondered who might get to torture her. Who was up for a reward?


 


""Someone bring me her husband and his brother,"" Voldemort said, an evil smile on his face. 


 


Rodolphus rose from his seat and moved toward the front. His hands were in front of him as though offering surrender. ""My dear Lord, I have tried to contain the witch's insanity but she is beyond my control. I-""


 


""It seems you would also benefit from learning how one control's their property then,"" the Dark Lord drawled. 


 


Rabastan suddenly stood and made to run from the room. Hexes hit him from all sides, his compatriots laughing wickedly as they drug him to the front. 


 


""All three of you, then?"" The tone of Voldemort's voice was sorrowful, as though he were hurt at the thought of their uselessness. 


 


Tonks shuddered at the creature's coldness as he gleefully waved his hand and the three Lestranges were naked and chained. They 

did

 deserve it, but it was still disturbing to watch their master do it so happily. 


 


""Antonin,"" Voldemort called. 


 


The man excitedly stood. Narcissa looked tense for a moment, breathing a visible sigh of relief when Dolohov moved forward without her. From the look on his face, the prospect of torturing the Lestranges was like a wet dream for the despicable man.


 


Voldemort smiled at him, which was never a good sign. ""You are the only person here... creative enough to do the carvings on these pets. I suggest you begin with the bitch. 'Blood Traitor's Whore' would look nice on her, don't you think?""


 


Narcissa sucked in a tight breath as her husband received Bellatrix's own cursed knife from Voldemort himself. Tonks supposed he had acquired it when he evanescoed their clothes away. She wondered if Narcissa's reaction was fear or delight. What Tonks would call her 'ice queen mask' was on as she avidly watched her sister's torture. 


 


The Death Eaters shouted suggestions of more words to use, especially after he moved on to Rodolphus and then Rabastan. They weren't very popular amongst the other Death Eaters it seemed. 


 


Tonks was feeling quite ill from listening to all the screaming when the Dark Lord finally halted the torture. 


 


""Thank you, my servant. You have been very useful. Perhaps you would like a second Black sister for the night? If we can ever capture the third, you could have a night with the whole set.""


 


Tonks felt Rowle stiffen beside her, his hand coming down to her shoulder to pull her slightly closer to himself. Narcissa's gaze flicked to her for one brief moment, their eyes meeting for the first time in Tonks' life. So she did know. But her eyes moved away immediately, back to the tableau in front of them. Tonks wasn't at all sure what that meant. 


 


Except that thank Merlin, no one else seemed to realize that she could be a stand-in for the set. 


 


""I would be honored to help in any way you wish me to, My Lord, and show them what it means to control a pet,"" Dolohov replied, his voice as happy as Tonks had ever heard it. 


 


He was starting back toward them, when Voldemort called out, ""Rowle?""


 


She felt him tense beside her before rising and making his way up past Dolohov to the area still covered in the Lestrange's blood. ""You called for me, my Lord?"" 


 


""I did,"" Voldemort hissed. ""I have a very special mission prepared for you. One that could prove you are ready to move up in our world.""


 


Tonks could see the smile Rowle tried and failed to hide. He was desperate to rise through the ranks.


 


A whisper to her side distracted Tonks for a moment. She looked at Narcissa peripherally. The older witch was focused hard on Dolohov, who stood transfixed and now looking angrily at Rowle. Narcissa was whispering over and over the words, 

""Lingua Solutam.""

 The wisp of magic moving through the crowd, unfocused by a wand, was barely noticeable - a good thing for Narcissa in the sense of not getting caught, but there wasn't quite enough power to influence her husband into the loose tongue she was hoping for.


 


Closing her eyes and focusing, Tonks pulled her magic to the surface. She wasn't sure what Narcissa thought the man would reveal, but she was exhausting herself to try and make him say something, so Tonks believed it must be important. She pushed her magic to Narcissa, whose eyes grew round with surprise before a tiny smile of triumph graced her lips for a moment.


 


""Why would you trust him with something important instead of me?"" Dolohov demanded angrily. His voice and the terrified look in his eyes did not match. ""I've been with you since the war but that overgrown Viking spawn is still just muscle with no brain. We all see what a lunatic your precious Bellatrix is, but I. 

I

 have been here for you just as long, just as faithfully! I would be better to assign a task to! I would-""


 


""Enough!"" Voldemort roared. His fury was so intense, Tonks was surprised there wasn't actual smoke pouring from his ears. ""Perhaps I do not choose you because, even though you deserve rewards, you want too badly to rise above your station.""


 


""You think he doesn't? Everyone has been talking about what Bellatrix offered to get him to let her have a go at his pet,"" Dolohov stated triumphantly. He didn't look as frightened, though a glance at the very smug Narcissa told Tonks his tongue was still looser than normal even though they had stopped performing the spell.


 


Rowle barked a laugh. ""You think I could be swayed by the bitch's overused cunt?"" he asked.


 


""No, I think she offered you something better,"" Dolohov snarled.


 


""There was an incident recently between the bitch and your pet, wasn't there, Rowle?"" Voldemort mused, his eyes narrowed.


 


The man bowed his head. ""Yes, my lord. But I didn't allow it. The bitch tried to kill her when I wouldn't hand her over.""


 


""That was when she nearly killed me as well, my Lord,"" Healer Zabini spoke up. Tonks could see hatred glittering in his eyes as he stared at Bellatrix. He never spoke without being required to but he apparently wanted to remind the Dark Lord that they had nearly lost their Healer because of the same incident.


 


Even Voldemort seemed surprised to have heard from the young Healer. Turning, he set his eyes back on Rowle. ""You are younger, Thorfinn, than many of the others, but you are an excellent warrior. You will be leading my forces into a battle.""


 


The entire room leaned forward in sudden interest despite the way they were still twitching and moaning from the pain of the earlier 

crucios.

 Tonks was sickened at the thought of what Voldemort might be planning. And here she was, able to hear the plans but with no way to get them to anyone who could use them. 


 


""I would be honored, my Lord,"" Rowle said, kneeling to show his obedience. 


 


""You will be speaking with Nott. He has made improvements to his spells for using the floo system."" Raising his voice joyfully, Voldemort cried, ""We can now break through 

any

 floo whether or not they are using it, as long as we know the address to call out.""


 


There was a rumble of excitement. Quieting everyone down, he said, ""Yes, young Rowle here will be taking our troops into Hogwarts.""


 


""Will you be joining us, my Lord?"" Rowle asked. Tonks could tell his tone was careful, meant to convey no emotion to the question.


 


""I will be watching to see if the time is right,"" he replied cryptically before telling the lot of them that it was nearly time for his dinner and he wanted them all out of his sight until the evening festivities.


 


Tonks wasn't sure if she was more relieved or upset that the meeting was over. For the first time since the incident, Rowle was eyeing her like he had plans to use her. She supposed his abstinence couldn't last forever, but it was certainly nice while it had. Steeling herself, she prepared to be led back to the room.


 


""Thorfinn,"" the Dark Lord spoke as everyone was heading for the doors. 


 


Tonks saw Rowle stiffen and then turn. ""Yes, my Lord?""


 


""Dolohov will be busy for the rest of the evening. Please assist his wife from the room. I'm sure he wouldn't want her wandering the Manor alone. Of course, you can't take her into her rooms, either, so I expect you will take excellent care of her in your own rooms. Treat her exactly as you would your other property. I suspect she has been quite poorly behaved during this meeting and her husband may not be as good at controlling others as he wishes me to believe.""


 


Narcissa paled and Rowle grinned. As far as she was aware, the man had no particular interest in Narcissa, but Tonks had been around the Death Eaters long enough to know that the opportunity to treat someone new however they wanted - particularly when it was also detrimental to a fellow Death Eater - meant that things were about to go very poorly for the willowy blonde. Rowle could be brutal when he wanted to be. Tonks could tell by the gleam in his eyes that he wanted to be right now. 


 


She could only selfishly hope it did not include herself.


 


**************************


 


Harry couldn't help but resent the fact, just a little, that Andromeda hadn't been willing to share the secret of communicating with Hogwarts until now. Even after she told them she could, no amount of wheedling, pouting, or downright begging had moved her to let them talk to their far away friends. 


 


""It is only to be used when the need is urgent,"" Andromeda reminded them again, just as she had every time it had been discussed. ""The more frequently we use it, the higher probability of Riddle discovering where we are.""


 


With that, she flung open her wardrobe and stepped inside, beckoning Harry and Hermione to follow. Theo wanted to come as well, but Andromeda had suggested he go back to training with that firmness in her voice that said the subject was closed. It was a relief. Harry was trying to feel less hostile toward the other boy, but he didn't want to share this with him.


 


When he followed Andromeda, Harry wasn't quite sure what he was expecting, but this wasn't quite it. Hermione looked visibly disappointed when they stepped beyond Andromeda's clothes and were in what appeared to be a posh sitting room still within Potter Manor. 


 


The older woman had strode forward to a large rectangular box that looked almost like a muggle telly. Harry and Hermione exchanged a confused look as they watched Andromeda fiddle with some knobs and repeatedly cast a few small spells. Finally, the box crackled with magic and a face came into view. 


 


""Andromeda! Is everything okay?"" a worried Molly Weasley cried. Harry was shocked by how much older she seemed since the Battle and then being away from her for a time.


 


""Yes, nothing to worry about. How is Teddy?""


 


Molly looked calmer now, ""He's doing well."" She waved someone over and Ginny appeared in the screen, Teddy on her shoulder with red hair that matched her own, sleeping peacefully. Harry felt his heart constrict in a way he couldn't have imagined. 


 


Ginny smiled and turned so that Andromeda could see her grandson's sweet little face. Molly said, ""He thankfully adores Ginny, you know. To be honest, Andromeda, I wouldn't be able to handle him without her.""


 


Harry noticed that Dromeda looked both relieved and concerned. ""Thank you, Molly. And you as well, Ginny dear. I will try to arrange to retrieve him soon.""


 


""You'll be staying there?"" Molly asked, looking a bit saddened by the idea, though Harry wasn't sure if that was because Andromeda wouldn't be returning to the castle or because she was taking Teddy away with her.


 


""I am needed here far more than at the castle,"" Andromeda told her with a regal nod. ""Now. Of course I wanted to check in on my grandson, but more importantly, we have news. Is Arthur there? Any of your boys?""


 


Molly turned from the screen and beckoned again. This time, she and Ginny were joined by Arthur, Bill, and George. Ron was undoubtedly busy with his duties, and who knows what Percy might be up to. 


 


""This is news for our family specifically?"" Bill asked, curiosity and surprise written all over his face.


 


""It is,"" Andromeda confirmed. ""I recommend you discuss it with Minerva and Kingsley before telling others, but obviously that will be up to you. Hermione received a message.""


 


Harry could tell Hermione hadn't expected to be thrust into the spotlight and therefore hadn't really thought out what she would say. She hated to be caught unprepared. Clearing her throat and glancing to him for encouragement, she stepped forward at Harry's nod.


 


""I received a Patronus a little while ago. It was from... well. First I should probably say that, though it's good news, it's vitally important that no one get excited and send one back. It would probably kill him.""


 


The Weasleys all seemed to get closer at that explanation, though it looked like questions were on the tip of several of their tongues.


 


Hermione continued before they could. ""The Patronus was a wolverine."" 


 


There was a collective gasp from the family. ""Are you sure?"" Molly asked intensely.


 


Andromeda stepped forward. ""You know I would recognize it anywhere, Molly. And it was his voice.""


 


Bill's voice was shaking. ""Why did he send it to Hermione?""


 


Before the girl in question could respond, Andromeda shook her head. ""He had information that was imperative to get to her immediately. It is not something we can share until we have discussed it with Minerva.""


 


""If it came from Charlie, we have a right to know!"" Molly declared.


 


Arthur put a hand on his wife's shoulder. ""Mollywobbles, let Hermione tell us what she can.""


 


Hermione took a deep breath, then explained, ""Charlie escaped Bellatrix."" The Weasleys all broke into huge grins and began hugging. ""But,"" her voice cut over them, ""he is still in the Manor. It's why it would be so dangerous to send a Patronus back.""


 


""How is he living in that place without getting caught?"" George asked quietly.


 


""He said... I know this is hard to believe, but it's what Charlie said. Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini are hiding him somewhere.""


 


""

Malfoy

 is hiding our brother from Voldemort?"" Ginny gasped in disbelief.


 


""It's what he said,"" Harry confirmed. 


 


Arthur had a harder look on his face than Harry had ever seen. ""Maybe Charlie was being forced to say those things. Or,"" he gulped, but looked even angrier, ""he's joined them.""


 


Harry tensed, shocked that Arthur of all people would suggest such a thing.


 


""For shame, Arthur!"" Andromeda snapped. ""Surely you know your own son better than that. I am absolutely certain Charlie has not joined the Dark Lord and was in fact trying to help more people by sending this message at great risk to himself. Nor did he sound as though he were being forced.""


 


Hermione seemed angry on behalf of the Weasley she barely knew. She glared at the assembled Weasleys as she delivered the rest of his message. ""Charlie said he's not leaving until he breaks Tonks and a few others out as well. He sent his love and said he'll be back as soon as he can manage it.""


 


Through tears, Bill said, ""Fucking Gryffindor to the core.""


 


""Language, William,"" his mother sniffled, though it was clearly more a reflex than something she meant. No one could argue with the sentiment.


 


""Thank you, Hermione,"" George told her. There were tears rolling down his cheeks as well. Actually, no one on either side of the screen had dry eyes at this point. ""I miss you,"" he added.


 


Harry saw Hermione jump slightly. ""I miss you, too, George. All of you, really,"" she said.


 


""We need all the friends we can get in times like these,"" George emphasized, perhaps realizing the way everyone had tensed when he told Hermione he missed her. The family might love her, and it wouldn't be her fault if George had developed feelings, but Harry was as aware as everyone else that another heartbreak might be more than he could handle. And, no matter how much they might all wish her to be, Hermione was very much not available.


 


""Perhaps there will be other times I could bring her along to see you when I speak with Molly,"" Andromeda suggested. ""But for now, we've had the connection open longer than we should already.""


 


""Wait!"" Ginny cried quietly. ""I need to speak more with Harry.""


 


Molly wrapped an arm around her crying daughter. ""I'm sure Andromeda will bring him back with her another time as well.""


 


""Of course.""


 


""Ginny,"" Harry began. Everything he could say felt inadequate for how much he missed her. ""I love you. I wish we could be together.""


 


""Me too, Harry,"" she agreed. ""For both. I love you, too.""


 


Seeing the screen go blank again was heartbreaking. Harry felt the loss of having Ginny by his side all over again. He missed her. He missed the entire extended family he had in the wizarding world. With a sigh, he shuffled back through the wardrobe after Andromeda and Hermione. 


 


""I suggest you go to bed, Hermione,"" Andromeda said in a tone that definitely meant a command rather than a suggestion. 


 


""I'll take her there, Dromeda,"" Harry offered. He honestly didn't want to be alone right now. In fact, as he and Hermione talked quietly on their way back to her room, they held hands as a show of support for one another. As they wandered, Hermione's thoughts drifted to her dreams.


 


""When I go to sleep tonight, he might be there,"" Hermione worried.


 


""Not if you take the Dreamless Sleep like Andromeda suggested,"" Harry pointed out. He really didn't like the idea of her dealing with Malfoy after this exhausting day.


 


""I just want to know he's okay,"" she mumbled, looking ashamed. ""I... I didn't mean to hurt him. Not really."" She looked at him with fear in her eyes. 


 


Harry knew she could be - probably was still - ashamed of what she'd done to the git. But he had a hunch that this was more about her fear of his reaction. Stopping them, he moved his hands to her shoulder and made her look at him. ""Hermione, it's okay to be worried about him, whether it's because you feel bad you did it or because of your connection to him. If you don't want to take that potion, I won't make you.""


 


Hermione stared back at him for a moment, probably assessing if he meant it, before saying a quiet, ""Thank you. I know you don't like him. I don't..."" She closed her eyes for a long moment as if to physically hold back the thought. ""I don't think I hate him anymore. I don't think I can. But  anything past that is... confusing.""


 


""You feel the way you feel and that's okay. It's your actions that matter. And I believe in your choices more than anyone else's in the world. You'll figure out the right way to handle Malfoy, and I'll support you in it no matter what it is.""


 


She threw herself at him, hugging him for all she was worth. Harry patted her on the back a little before pulling away. 


 


""Now let's go on,"" Harry told her as they started back to her room, ""before I manage to screw up everything I just said by calling him Ferret and making fun of his poncy hair or the way you punched him in the face back in third year."" 


 


Hermione laughed at that and let him guide her to bed.


 


***************************


 


Fear and fury warred in Blaise's veins as he rushed to the secret room. His feelings were so intense that he couldn't even feel relief when he saw the redhead walking almost casually from the loo toward his bedroom closet with a towel hanging low on his hips.


 


The words were out of his mouth before he fully made it into the room, ""How fucking 

dare 

you?"" Blaise demanded, stopping the man in his tracks. ""You could have been killed!""


 


Charlie started walking again, making his way to his closet. ""Could've been,"" he acknowledged as he picked some clothes, ""But I wasn't.""


 


""He knows you were a mouse!""


 


""He knows?"" Charlie asked, going pale.


 


""Not for sure, but he suspects. Apparently the fucking snake told him.""


 


Charlie visibly shuddered before saying, ""I knew it was a risk, but it had to happen.""


 


""What the fuck was so fucking important!?"" Blaise fumed. He went on before Charlie could even attempt to respond. ""Have a message you had to send to your precious fucking Order? Something to say to your Mummy? Your brothers who left you behind?""


 


""No, Blaise,"" Charlie said. His voice was muffled as he pulled a robe over his body and dropped the towel from beneath it. 


 


Blaise was so angry he was shaking. ""Then what the fuck were you thinking?"" he screamed across the room.


 


Charlie turned toward him for the first time and Blaise could see how his eyes were red-rimmed and his shoulders slumped before straightening them and looking him directly in the eyes. Blaise saw that fire, the certainty and purpose strong in Charlie's gaze. ""I was thinking that Hermione was going to kill Draco in her ignorance and there was only one way to get a message through to her.""


 


Blaise felt suddenly small and his voice reflected it. ""You sent a Patronus to keep Draco safe?"" 


 


Of course Charlie would always play the noble Gryffindor in an emergency, but... It had been obvious to Blaise that this was a carefully planned maneuver, just based on how far away across the Manor the Patronus had come from. This hadn't been a spur of the moment charge into battle. Nor had it been a wild plan to request a rescue or any of the other things Blaise had been ripping himself apart thinking. No, it was something so bizarre he couldn't wrap his head around it. Charlie had purposefully risked his 

life

 to protect Draco.


 


""Of course,"" Charlie replied simply. His voice was still firm, but exhaustion was slipping through. Blaise wondered how harrowing the experience had been for Charlie to be this worn out and upset. 


 


There was a pause while Blaise tried to reconcile his anger and fear and hurt but failed to bury it all. ""Why didn't you tell me?"" he asked quietly. He was trying not to let his voice quiver, but now that the anger was subsiding, Blaise felt like crying.


 


That question caused Charlie to smile wanly. ""Do you really need to ask?""


 


""Yeah, I do,"" Blaise said, looking away to hide some of the emotions spilling through him. 


 


""You would have told me I was being a stupid Gryffindor and to not do it,"" Charlie said quietly. ""And then Draco would have died.""


 


Blaise spluttered at him. ""Like you would just... 

not

 do something crazy and stupid because I didn't want you to!""


 


""If you told me I couldn't... It may not stop me... but it would mean something to me.""


 


A bark of a laugh was all Blaise could manage around the intensity of his emotions. ""At least if you gave me the opportunity to tell you what I thought, I would have some fucking warning.""


 


Charlie was standing right in front of him now, though Blaise was too afraid to look into his face. The other man spoke after a few moments. ""I know... I know you're upset with me and I know I deserve it, but... please, Blaise. Fighting with you is the last thing I want right now.""


 


""So what do you fucking want? You're obviously just going to do it, whatever it is, no matter what I might think about it, what 

I

 might want,"" Blaise said. He knew his tone was more bitter than it should be, his voice louder and harsher. He knew he was being more of an arsehole to Charlie than he needed to be. 


 


He just... There was no way to tell this man how he felt, how his whole world stopped when he thought Charlie might be hurt. Blaise was too far gone to keep the emotions at bay and far too hopeless to admit them. Sure, Charlie was flirty sometimes. Yes, there were moments when Blaise thought there might be some feelings there. They certainly shared attraction and a deep connection. But after what he had done, how things had started... The two of them could never truly work out.


 


Blaise was startled by how close Charlie's body was when the redhead placed his large hands on either side of Blaise's face and stared into his eyes. ""When I can help it, I won't do the things you don't want me to."" 


 


The look on his face was so earnest that Blaise's breath caught. And when he rubbed a thumb across Blaise's cheek to rest just at the corner of his mouth, Blaise was certain he had stopped breathing entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       


 


""So if you don't want this,"" Charlie was leaning closer, his lips just centimeters from Blaise's own, ""I won't do it, but Merlin I hope you do. Because, honestly Blaise, I'm going mad for another taste of you and I need you badly right now - as a friend, but also... I hope... as more.""


 


There was no question how Blaise felt about that. He could feel Charlie's hot breath on his lips but he wanted far more. This was one instance where he was thrilled to show Charlie his feelings. 


 


Blaise closed the tiny gap between them. Their lips pressed together firmly but still with a tentative quality they hadn't been able to explore the first time they kissed. He felt the harsh brush of Charlie's stubble against his own face and delighted in the contrast of that feeling versus the soft skin of his lips. 


 


There was no battle for dominance in this kiss. Blaise was starting to breathe hard as he realized how sweet and loving the kiss was as Charlie explored him and allowed him to explore as well. 


 


When they finally pulled away, Blaise leaned his forehead against Charlie's and ran his hands up and down the other man's back. The two stayed that way for a long moment. 


 


""This is what I want,"" Charlie said even though his breath was still uneven. ""Just to... to be held tonight and feel safe.""


 


Blaise pulled him a little closer. ""I would love to be with you tonight.""


 


He felt Charlie stiffen in his arms. There was a tremor in his voice when he said, ""I don't mean... I just can't yet. I think... eventually. It's not that I don't want to...""


 


Blaise ran a hand up through his still-wet curls. He moved cautiously to be sure he didn't startle Charlie. He had to clear his throat before saying,""I don't need that to want to hold you. I can be a gentleman."" 


 


Charlie laughed at that, though he was still a little shaky. ""Thank you,"" he breathed. 


 


**************


 


Hermione twisted her hands together as she sat on the fountain ledge, nervous now that she knew how very real this all was. She had rehearsed an apology, but it all felt so inadequate when she had hurt him so badly.


 


A twig snapped and Hermione jerked her head up. Malfoy was standing just outside his pathway through the roses. He wasn't entirely corporeal yet, but was becoming steadily more present. Looking him over, she felt a sinking feeling at how badly wounded he looked. There were scratches all over him and he looked completely drained. 


 


""Malfoy, I'm so sorry!"" she cried. Before she knew what she was doing, she crossed the clearing and ran her hands all over him, checking for wounds. Would he have gotten them healed? 

Could

 they be healed? Charlie hadn't been able to give her a lot of detail. 


 


She heard him gasp, body held stiff, then his nose was buried in her hair, arms pulling her close, and his whole body relaxed against her. She jerked in surprise but was too shocked to move. He made a little sound and she almost thought he was crying, he was shaking so hard. Only, after a moment, she realized it was the start of a laugh, a genuine, true laugh.


 


""Bastard did it, didn't he?"" Draco asked, still laughing. ""He said he was going to but I didn't really think... He's a Weasley, you know? Idiots, the lot of them.""


 


Hermione backed away and started to nod, but she was a little stunned. She had never heard Malfoy laugh like a real person before. It was extremely disconcerting. It also, she noticed, made his face shine, the sharp bones seeming less angular, the sullen, sunken eyes brightening with mirth. She could get used to sharing life with a face like that.


 


She had apparently looked at him too long. Malfoy's face slid back into his careful mask and he curled his lip up a bit as he said, ""So you believe me now, I guess. Since someone from your side-""


 


""I've heard you're on our side, though you make it very hard to believe,"" she stated, the rest of the apology she had planned was already gone from her mind. Why did he have to be such an arse?


 


Malfoy's jaw dropped. ""Charlie really said that?"" he asked in disbelief. 


 


She stared at him for a long moment before answering. ""Yes, or his Patronus did anyway, but I would have thought you would know what he said."" She tilted her head, curious.


 


He barked a laugh. ""He dosed me with potions so I would be believable in my fake coma. I think when I fade in like this it's because I was on Dreamless Sleep but it's worn off.""           


 


Hermione was fascinated. ""Do you think-""


 


She was cut off by his swearing as blood had dripped into his eye. She started to grab her wand to help him, but he shook his head emphatically. ""Keep your wand to yourself. I've already seen the damage you can do with it.""


 


""Did I do that to you?"" she asked, watching him attempt to seal the gash on his forehead. Merlin, how could this be real? How could she not have known? It seemed obvious now. He was too much his irritating self to be a figment of her imagination.


 


""Of course bloody not! Blaise healed basically everything."" 


 


""Basically?"" Hermione questioned as he sealed off the new cut, leaving a line of pink skin.


 


""What?""


 


""Basically means almost everything. Not everything."" she said with her eyes narrowed as they scanned over his body but saw nothing. 


 


""Thank you for the grammar lesson. I will be sure to use it on my NEWTs if they have a primary school section,"" he snapped.


 


""What 

didn't 

 he heal Malfoy?""


 


""Don't worry about it.


 


""Malfoy,"" Hermione hissed, crossing her arms. She continued to glare at him silently as he looked elsewhere. She found that when trying to pull information from boys, awkward silences worked the best. To his credit it took him a full minute to crack, Ron and Harry could barely last ten seconds.  


 


""You won't bloody leave it alone until I tell you, will you, Granger?"".


 


""Of course not!"" she said. 


 


""Why can't you just leave anything alone,"" he growled. ""Always sticking your nose into things that don't concern you.""


 


""Well this concerns me doesn't it,"" Hermione snapped. ""If you're hurt and I did it, I should try to undo it.""


 


""Such the martyr, as always.""


 


""And what's that supposed to mean?"" she shouted.


 


""Always trying to save others. Doing things you hate. Not because you want to, just because you 'should'."" He sneered at her. ""Well I don't want your damned help.""


 


The bitterness in his voice rubbed at Hermione's frustration toward their situation, bringing her blood to a boil. ""Well I don't want to 

help

 you at all! Why in the hell should I? Charlie made it seem like you needed me but if not, just leave before I hex you.""


 


""I 

don't 

fucking need you! The bond needs you,"" he shouted at her. ""It's how it works!""


 


""I never asked to be bonded to you"" she shouted back.


 


""You think I did?"" Malfoy snarled. ""You think I fucking want to be around someone who doesn't want me? Do you think I like needing you?""


 


""Fuck you, Malfoy!"" Hermione shouted, smacking her hand against his chest. Now, Hermione knew that she was a formidable witch, dangerous with a wand and deadly with her words. But she was a small woman, hardly capable of landing blows that would make a man crumble. 


 


When Malfoy stumbled back, yelping in pain, her eyes narrowed and her anger was funneled into suspicion. Taking the moment where he was still trying to catch his breath, she drew her wand and banished his shirt.


 


Hermione gasped as she stared at the marks on his chest. They were a light brown color and seemed to follow along his veins and arteries, getting lighter as they went. In the middle was dark, like infected flesh, swollen and painful. 


 


Overcome by the sight, she moved forward until she was just in front of him. Her hand reached out of its own accord, the urge to be closer suddenly overwhelming. Tentatively, she touched one of the tendril-like marks along a vein. 


 


Malfoy hissed at the contact. He shivered as she felt her magic stirring between them. A breeze of the glittering they felt through the bond swept over them both. ""Fuck,"" he whispered, ""What are you-""


 


""Shh,"" Hermione shushed as she watched the color begin to retreat as she dragged her finger along the dark line. She stood in silence, watching the smooth skin of his chest return to alabaster until it met the darkest part around his heart area.


 


Malfoy took a shaky breath in. She looked up to his face. He was breathing heavily and his eyes were hooded, the pupils growing larger by the moment. Malfoy stared at her with an expression she had never imagined she would see from him. 


 


""Don't... please..."" he said. His voice was soft with something she didn't quite recognize coming from him.


 


""You want me to leave you like this?"" she asked, confused. Why would he want to stay like this? Exasperated with the arsehole despite her guilt, she demanded, ""Just let me take care of it.""


 


He scoffed, but didn't say anything, looking away instead. After a moment, Hermione began to trace the next tendril back toward his heart. 


 


Malfoy stood like a statue, jaw clenched. His grey eyes, what little was there around his wide pupils, were steel as he stared over her shoulder, obviously trying to ignore her touch. Hermione was fine with that. She traced up toward his heart again and again, feeling her own clench at the thought that she had somehow done this to anyone. 


 


With each line that she erased, the black hole in the middle became a little less swollen, a little healthier and less infected, even if it wasn't getting much lighter in color. 


 


Occasionally, Malfoy would let a tiny groan slip or a whimper when she slid over a particularly dark spot. His skin would pink every time that happened, making Hermione feel an unwelcome surge of sympathy for the embarrassingly needy position he was in. In the best of circumstances, this would hurt his oversized pride. For it to be 

her

 who had to do it? 


 


It took far longer than she had imagined, but finally all the lines spiraling out across his chest were gone, leaving only the blackness just above his heart. Not sure what else to do, she leaned forward and pressed her hand over the area, looking up at his face to gauge any reaction. 


 


The reaction she was looking for didn't come, but she could feel how fast and intense his heart was beating. Trying to jerk away, Malfoy finally looked down at her. If possible, his eyes became even wider. 


 


""You fixed it

.

"" Malfoy looked amazed. 


 


""Some of it,"" Hermione confirmed with a frown. ""I don't know what else to do.""


 


Malfoy ran his hands through his hair, unintentionally ruffling it up and making it flop over his eyes. It was hard for Hermione to admit but, honestly, seeing him looking less than perfect, with his eyes completely blown and focused on her was exhilarating. 


 


""I don't know how you did this much,"" he revealed with wonder in his tone. ""How? You rejected the bond. You hate me!""


 


""I don't hate you. I just... sometimes you aren't awful. And I certainly don't want you to 

die

,"" Hermione wasn't sure where this confession came from, but she knew deep down it was true. 


 


""I want..."" he started to reply, but suddenly he was fading away. She could see him reaching for her, a certain desperation in his eyes, but he couldn't talk, couldn't grasp anything. The wispy vision of him slid through her and made Hermione shiver. 


 


When he was gone, she bit her lip and started making mental notes. She wasn't sure why the bond magic had worked for part of his wound but not all of it. She felt pleased that some of it was gone, but she had a lot of research to do if she wanted to fix the damage she had done completely. But for now... Unless she could figure out what to do for his wound this moment, she could wait a few days, take a few Dreamless Sleep potions, while she figured out what else needed to be said between them. 


 

Tell me how you feel about Charlie and Blaise! And Draco and Hermione! And everything with Tonks. And Narcissa - what's up with her? 

And if you have any strong opinions about the kind of story you're enjoying reading - focused Dramione vs Epic war fic covering more people - talk to me about it. I really would appreciate input.

Thank you all for continuing to read this. No matter which direction I go with it, this is my first fanfic and absolutely is my baby.

Hmmmm...also should say that I'm posting this pretty late at night (early morning) and am very tired so if there are any glaringly stupid mistakes, please point those out, too. LOL

Did you miss me? I sometimes feel like this story wouldn't be a loss at all if I let it slide, but then I get excited about it again and have to remind myself that, as much fun as it is to hear from enthused readers, I'm really doing this because it makes *me* happy. 

And because I'm making myself happy (and perhaps I am also influenced by the majority of my comments leaning this direction or to follow my muse), this will stay the course of an epic. It's the story I set out to write, the one I *want* to write. Sure, it could have been good as a Dramione, too. But I would lose interest. 

So. This is not just a Dramione (for now - I'm sure I'll have this crisis again in another 20 chapters or so). It's everyone. And that is apparent in chapters like this one where the main characters are only ever mentioned, not a part of the action.

Omnenomnom is my forever alpha and best fanfiction friend ever! Especially because she's putting up with this even though I'm going the epic route. <3   

I have also added my side alpha, StarGirlPotter. She's my wild ass ideas girl. Like, I'm going ""and then this crazy thing happens"" and she's like ""but what if this crazy thing happens too!"" Seriously, though. She has been helping me wade through all of my ideas, discarding the ones that are too far out there and helping me come up with ways to make the others work.               

I don't own Harry Potter.

Tuesday, June 9th; early morning


 


Ginny startled awake to a loud crashing sound somewhere nearby. It was loud, too loud, like one of the twins' parties in the common room. Hastily finding clothes, Ginny grabbed her wand as she began dressing. She was still pulling on her pants as she hopped out of her dorm room. 


 


There were others on the stairs, but a traffic jam at the bottom. It wasn't hard to figure out why. Angelina was holding people back, darting in and out of the stairwell with her wand drawn. Ginny could hear screams from the Common Room, though it made no sense how anyone could be there who would fight them like this. 


 


""What's going on?"" Ginny demanded.


 


""Death Eaters,"" came the quick response from Alicia Spinnet.


 


Ginny felt adrenaline rush through her all over again. ""How did they get inside? The Fat Lady would never let anyone in without the password!""


 


""From the fire, like the floo but it should be closed,"" Parvati Patil said. Her voice was shaking but she had her wand out and a determined look on her face.


 


""It's impossible!"" ""That can't be it."" ""The Fat Lady must have let them in."" Voices up and down were denying the truth in front of them. Many of them seemed torn between trying to see what was going on and wanting to retreat to the relative safety of their rooms.


 


Pushing through the crowd on the stairs was impossible so Ginny started commanding instead. ""If you aren't going out to join the fight, get into a dorm room now!"" People began to move, letting those who wanted to move down. 


 


Ginny put an acknowledging hand on Angelina's shoulder. The older girl started to say something, probably a warning, but then she nodded and let Ginny pass along with a few others.


 


As the Common Room came fully into view, Ginny felt bile rise up in her throat. The sight was not pretty. There were Death Eaters - at least 20 - in the room. Carnage littered the floor around them. Though most of it was broken furniture Ginny had to choke back a gag at the sight of ahe dismantled body. 


 


One of the younger Gryffindor boys, maybe a second or third year who shouldn't even be there anymore - Ginny was ashamed to say she didn't even know his name - was moments from death. Part of her wanted to do anything and everything possible to save him. The more logical part realized his death was a mercy at this point. She was frozen for a moment, remembering how this boy had asked her for help with his potions homework from time to time, too afraid of Snape to ask proper questions in class. Now he would never need to know.


 


Some of the elder Gryffindors were fighting Death Eaters at the fringe of the group while the monster in the middle had been destroying the child. George and Cormac McLaggen were fighting back to back, a circle of fallen Death Eaters around them. They were undoubtedly generic ones, guard-duty level. Only the one mask in the center was unique, but some of the lesser fighters were holding their own. The training was getting better for their lower ranks. 


 


Ginny assessed quickly, then jumped into the fray. She leapt off the stairs onto the back of one Death Eater while shooting a stunner at the one next to him. The one whose back she jumped on was off balance now, and flailing about trying to get her off. A strong arm wrapped around her waist as someone hit her Death Eater and he crumpled to the floor. 


 


She started to fight the arm when she looked up and realized it was Ron's friend Finian who had snatched her out of the air. She could live with that. She nodded to him as he set her down and they both started shooting curses. 


 


The time for holding back was gone. Ginny wanted blood to make up for what had been done to that poor boy. She clearly wasn't the only one. Within minutes, the tide of the battle had turned. Where the Death Eaters had the upper hand at first through the element of surprise and cruelty, the Gryffindors had now gained the advantage by surprising the enemy with their willingness to engage with a viciousness that they didn't expect from the Order. 


 


There were curses that would destroy an arm or a leg. Some that would blow up the whole area around a person, leaving only bits of them behind. The blood could boil or the air freeze in suddenly dysfunctional lungs. The spells were brutal and dark, but she was past caring. They all were. It was a necessary evil as far as Ginny was concerned.



. 



By the time she was done the masked Death Eater was the last man standing. Ginny could see him desperately eyeing the floo. There was no way she was letting this arsehole get by her. She planted herself firmly in front of the fire. George and Finian had the same idea, so the three of them stood abreast as others circled the man. 


 


""You've seen what I can do,"" a deep voice with a thick accent emanated from the mask. Dolohov. There was no question. ""Know that I can hurt much more quickly if you do not get out of my way.""


 


""You think you're leaving this room?"" Angelina scoffed.


 


""We're not letting you go,"" George added.


 


""That is fine,"" Dolohov laughed. ""I will die for my cause while your people through the castle die for theirs.""


 


Everyone froze. Ginny felt her heart squeeze. Was he telling the truth? What if Death Eaters had entered all the common rooms? What if they were all throughout the castle now? 


 


While they were distracted, Dolohov shot an 

accio

 across the room and suddenly had Parvati in his arms. He was laughing as he ran a knife down the side of her face. It was light, just a trickle of blood began, but Parvati was shaking. 


 


""Ah, my sweet lioness,"" Dolohov cooed at her. ""I have played with this one before, but I didn't get to finish. I will be happy to do so now if you don't let me through.""


 


Fury shot through Ginny, but she knew there was nothing they could do but stand down. She wouldn't watch Parvati be tortured to death. Still, they had to be careful. 


 


""You will give her back to us before we let you in the floo,"" Ginny demanded.


 


He began to laugh and she hit him with a stinging hex to his ear. Dolohov gave a surprised yelp and retaliated by digging the knife in just a bit. Parvati was crying now. ""I'm afraid you underestimate my desire to keep this one. But I will keep her 

alive

 and mostly 

whole

 if you let me go.""


 


It was an impossible choice. But she noticed George and Finian appeared to be having some kind of conversation with their eyes just before they stood aside, Finian pulling her with him. Seeing their choice, the others cleared a path for Dolohov to exit, dragging Parvati along with him. 


 


As they stepped just inside the floo, George darted forward wrenching Parvati away as Finian distracted the man with curses. ""

Furnunculus! Locomotor Wibbly! Sectumsempra!""

 The last sliced through the mans chest just as he fell through the floo and away. To no one's surprise, it had been Malfoy Manor he called out as he went through.


 


Parvati was screaming in George's arms, her blood spilling as Dolohov had managed a large gash in her neck when George pulled her away. ""Any healers? I can only slow it down! No? Shite! Cormac, can you get her safely to the hospital wing?"" he asked.


 


""Of course,"" the boy replied. ""Come on Parvati."" He ended up having to carry her, but Ginny wasn't worried about it. Cormac liked the girl, even though she didn't return it, he wouldn't let anything happen to her.


 


""We have to find out what's going on in the rest of the castle. Stick together until I say otherwise,"" George commanded. With Ron in his new rooms down by the Headmistress's office, it seemed that George was the next choice for who was in charge.


 


""Shouldn't we spread out and check the other common rooms?"" Seamus asked.


 


""Not when they might be in the main corridors as well. We need to get to McGonagall. She can seal the corridors and Common Rooms,"" George answered. 


 


""But that will trap them in!"" Seamus argued.


 


""That may be the best choice,"" George said, voice hardened.


 


""I don't think...""


 


""Look, I'll send a patronus to McGonagall, but if she doesn't answer, we have to get down to the Great Hall. If we hear back from her, we'll follow her directions from there. Until then, we're safer in a crowd. Get everyone.""


 


People moved quickly, following his instructions without further argument as George conjured his Magpie and gave it the message that the Common Room had been attacked and they were worried about the others. Soon, the entire Tower had been mobilized. George instructed people to keep the few younger students in the middle, the young adults were on the outside on guard as they moved. 


 


It didn't take long to run into Ravenclaws who were on their way to escape. Their Common Room had indeed been the recipient of another attack. George was conflicted, but ultimately sent a contingent of fighters. Finian led the group of Seamus, Lee, Angelina, and a few others. Jacob Finch-Fletchley was leading them. Ginny hoped that was enough to get them back.


 


**************************


 


Luna hated fighting. She would do it, of course. There was no reasoning with these people, unfortunately. She had tried. She wasn't even the only one. Several of her housemates had tried to reason with them. It was in the Ravenclaws' nature. But it was in the nature of the Death Eaters to harm those who they considered lesser, including anyone who opposed them. 


 


Most of the Ravenclaws hadn't even bothered to fight, just hid or raced out the door. She understood. It was a safer bet; simply a numbers game. Part of Luna wanted to as well. But she knew better. She had Seen what was to come. It was essential that she distract one particular Death Eater. The rest would leave, and that was okay.


 


There was an evil cackle coming through the floo as Bellatrix Lestrange stepped through. Luna braced herself for what needed to be done. She stepped forward and touched the woman. It was almost gentle, but directly on her back. Luna could feel the ridges of scabs over the wounds on Bellatrix's back. Not that she knew that's what they were, of course. She had only Seen that this would hurt the other woman. But she guessed. And her guesses were often correct.


 


Bellatrix gave a gasp of pain and then whirled to face Luna. ""How dare you, filth?"" Bellatrix spat at her. 


 


Luna smiled back. It clearly unnerved her. ""I was just wondering if you knew you dropped this,"" Luna said sweetly.


 


When Bellatrix looked at what Luna was holding out to her, Luna threw the powder into her face, causing the woman to be temporarily blinded, lost in the blackness of the twins' Peruvian Instant Darkness. Bellatrix screeched in horror, anger, and frustration, her hands lashing out to catch Luna, but the girl had already stepped away. She was a Ravenclaw after all, too smart for that. 


 


Shaking her head sadly, Luna picked up a nearby long candlestick. With simple precision, she walked to the exact point where she could stand back but still reach and swung the stick so that it hit Bellatrix in the back of the head. She shoved her in a pile into the fireplace and sent her back to Malfoy Manor. Hopefully that was correct. It was a shame she couldn't have just ended her madness right there, but that wasn't meant to be. Bellatrix was still needed for it all to work out.


 


Turning to the others, she saw that a crowd of Gryffindors had followed Jacob Finch-Fletchley into the Common Room and begun dueling. Luna absentmindedly flicked an impedimenta at the ones closing in on the Gryffindors, but the rest rapidly slipped out the door, intent on some other prey. It appeared the Common Room wasn't their destination. Luna sighed as she watched them go and then joined the fight continuing here.


 


******************


 


The doors to the hospital wing burst open and Neville looked up to see Gran rushing in, still wearing her night dress. It was ridiculously early, sunrise still half an hour away, but some of his plants only accepted water at this time of day so he had been up already, shuffling around in his hospital-issued pajamas. 


 


These days, there wasn't much use in getting dressed unless he knew Cho was coming to see him. Not that she cared what he was wearing, but he wanted to make the best impression he could. It had been a long time since he had been so interested in someone. She made him want to show her his best self.


 


Right now, though, he had other things to think about first. ""Gran?"" he questioned. ""What's wrong?""


 


""They're in the castle!"" She was rushing toward him, wand drawn. 


 


""Who?"" he asked, though in his heart, Neville knew. There was only one set of people who might be ballsy enough to attack Hogwarts, even with it half broken down.


 


There was no opportunity for Gran to respond as there was a sudden commotion in the hallway and then the doors slowly swung open. Death Eaters. Several of them looked fully ready to charge. Others were as stunned to see his battle-ready Gran as he was. Neville held his breath for a few seconds before launching into action as well.


 


He snatched his wand from the table by his bedside and began casting. He dared not interfere with Gran's fight. She was too close and he wouldn't chance hitting her. But there were plenty of other Death Eaters filtering in. 


 


At the head of the group, there were three uniquely masked figures, plus at least a dozen of the generic ones. Neville made a move for the Inner Circle members. He needed to keep them away from Gran and from the other patients in the Hospital Wing, all of whom were now hiding behind their beds or helping one another toward the back of the room and Madam Pomfrey's office. Where was she? But he didn't really have time to ponder. Moving swiftly, he sent a variety of slicing hexes and stunners. He wasn't ready to cast the more ruthless things Ron had been suggesting at the meetings lately.


 


Gran was holding her own. She had taken three down already, but one of the Inner Circle members was closing in as well as two more generics. Her vulture hat had fallen to the ground and her hair was coming unpinned. Neville had never seen her in such disarray. But he was intensely proud of the way she was spinning and casting, hitting the Death Eaters over and over. To his relief, several of the Weasleys appeared at the doorway, cutting the Death Eaters off from any possible retreat. Now they were more evenly matched.


 


A man growled at Neville and physically lunged, catching him off guard. The man's wand was at his neck and he knew it was over. From somewhere behind him he heard an angry cry, ""Confractus Ossa!"" The man crumbled in front of him, screaming.


 


Neville spun and stared at Madame Pomfrey who was marching through the ward with the clear intent of protecting her charges. The man in front of him had bone shards sticking out of his skin here and there. Neville snatched up his wand where the man had dropped it and snapped it in half. 


 


Kicking him in the face, Neville stepped forward on his path to duel the Inner Circle members. 


 


""That was one of my pups,"" one of them snarled, targeting him. 


 


""I'm afraid I don't really give a damn,"" Neville informed the man politely as he blasted him off his feet. ""Who the hell did they get to replace Greyback anyway?""


 


The man's mask fell off, revealing Augustus Rookwood - not who Neville would have expected to turn wolf. He was too old for one thing. From what little Neville knew about werewolves, he doubted Rookwood would be able to hold the pack for long. Of course, if he had his way, the man - wolf - wouldn't be around after today to do anything with the pack. 


 


Rookwood pulled himself from the ground and hit Neville with a 

Petrifucus Totalus. 

Damn, he hated that spell. As he fell, he saw Ron jump at Rookwood and begin dueling him. But another Death Eater, one of the Inner Circle, had stepped away from the fight with Gran and was sneaking up behind Ron. Neville could do nothing to warn him, nothing at all except watch. 


 


This new Death Eater raised his wand. Neville couldn't hear what he whispered, but it hit Ron squarely in the back. Neville's friend, the General of the army of Light, screamed. Ron's wand glowed suddenly and then seemed to burst, blowing everyone in the vicinity backwards. The Death Eaters began laughing. The one who hit Ron shouted something that Neville couldn't make out past the blood-curdling screams. Death Eaters, both the important ones and their minions, began flowing from the room as the Order members rushed to help Ron, all except Gran who was headed Neville's way instead.


 


A single Death Eater turned back. His wand came up and a green beam shot from it. Neville was confused for a moment. It had gone to the side of the main group. Gran. It went straight for Gran. And she dropped with her look of concern for him still on her face.


 


***********************


 


George was relieved when they made it to the Great Hall without running into any new Death Eaters. From here, however, he could hear fighting off near the hospital wing. They rushed even more now. George was eager to get to the fight. 


 


They were soon fighting in the hallway. Even a few of the younger ones stepped forward to defend, despite his orders not to. The only Death Eaters not fighting were two small ones pressed up against the wall of the hall clutching one another as though terrified. They would defend, but not attack.


 


There wasn't much time for George to notice further details. He was wading through the dark troops, flinging 

sectumsempras

 or worse at everyone he could get to without harming one of their own. The time for mercy was long past for him. It died with Fred. 


 


From the corner of his eyes, George saw some of the Order's numbers were dropping, even as some of the adults that had come pouring out of the family wings that Hogwarts had provided as the need grew. Overall, though, there were more Death Eaters falling than Order members. Soon, they were almost to the Hospital Wing, which seemed to be the Death Eater's target. 


 


A cry sounded from inside and George redoubled his efforts. He would swear that was his brother. Death Eaters were running past him now, inexplicably headed for the Great Hall. He couldn't chase them until he knew Ron was okay. 


 


The hospital wing was littered with bodies on the floor. Looking across the carnage, he saw his family - Mum, Dad, Bill, Fleur, and Percy crowded around someone on the floor. McGonagall was standing over them, fighting tears as Madame Pomfrey worked. To one side, Neville was making his way toward someone on the ground, his movements jerky as though he was fighting off a spell. George realized it was his Gran that Neville dropped next to, sobbing, and rage filled him. So many families destroyed and for what?


 


He stormed back out of the hospital wing. There was nothing he could do for Ron except take down the ones who did this to him. George was getting very good at that. For Fred, for Charlie, now for Ron and Neville, too.


 


Unfortunately, there were only two Death Eaters left in the hall. The small, terrified ones who had been hanging back earlier were still frozen in place together. Well, George was going to give them something to be terrified of. As he stalked toward them, they both dropped to their knees and held their hands up. He didn't care. He couldn't. They were Death Eaters and they weren't leaving this castle.


 


It was Ginny who was suddenly beside him, pulling down the hand that was raising his wand. ""They're surrendering, George.""


 


""We don't take prisoners,"" he reminded her.


 


""Well we're going to have to. We're not killing people who didn't run away with the others,"" she told him obstinately. 


 


""They did something to Ron.""


 


Fury crossed Ginny's face and she turned to them angrily.


 


""Not us! We didn't hurt anyone who didn't hurt us first,"" cried a surprisingly young and feminine voice. 


 


""And it was just stunners when we had to,"" said the other, also young and feminine.


 


Before he had time to demand they remove their masks, George heard angry voices from the Great Hall, then Kingsley's booming voice calling for quiet. ""

Incarcerous,""

 he chanted at the two Death Eaters.


 


Ginny started to protest but he shook his head. ""We need to see what's going on and I'm not leaving them loose."" George stepped forward and took their wands. Neither of them protested.


 


Turning, he grabbed Ginny and headed for the Hall. 


 


""They got away, but we took down a large number of them,"" Kingsley was saying. There were bodies strewn around the giant fireplace there, which led George to deduce they had flooed away from there - fascinating as it did not, so far as he knew, have a connection.


 


""But how did they get in?"" a frightened voice demanded from the crowd.


 


""We don't know yet,"" Kingsley admitted, ""But we will not rest until we find out.""


 


""How can any of us rest knowing they can get into our Common Rooms?"" Angelina asked.


 


Kingsley looked ten years older when he said, ""We'll have to post guards by all the fireplaces, even the ones that have never had floo connections."" He then began delegating jobs to carry and tend the wounded as well as dispose of bodies.


 


""Is that the only version of protection we can rely on?"" George asked him quietly.


 


""I'll be talking to Hermione. She has been working on the warding problem, but it hadn't seemed urgent with the Fidelius. I had no idea they could come through the floos that way. Previously someone had to be actively using a floo, which was frightening enough."" Kingsley's tone was low to keep others from overhearing. ""We'll use whatever research she has come up with so far as soon as possible.""


 


*********************


 


""How did this happen?"" Lord Voldemort hissed at them. 


 


Those of the Inner Circle cowered before him. It was just them this evening. Well, and Blaise of course. He could hardly get out of it when so many of them had needed or 

would need

 healing. That he had the entire infirmary full upstairs and Draco had no idea what to do to help most of them was beside the point. 


 


""Rowle?"" he demanded when no one else answered.


 


The man crawled forward and touched his head to the ground. ""Forgive me, my Lord. Our mission was accomplished, but we lost so many because orders were not followed.""


 


""Oh yes?"" the Dark Lord encouraged.


 


""Yes. Bellatrix never arrived from the Ravenclaw Common Room and Dolohov did not leave the Gryffindor Common Room. I am told he decided to toy with those who found them first, resulting in nearly all of those who entered through that room to fall. It left our forces entirely unprepared on one side. Once the Order were in our midst, defending against them was almost impossible, my Lord.""


 


""I was merely taking care of a threat!"" Dolohov cried, trying to save himself. Blaise was relieved. Better that idiot be harmed than Rowle who would take it out on Tonks. And Narcissa. He had to remember to be careful when visiting that room now. Especially if Dolohov continued to mess up and Narcissa was left with him long-term.


 


""Funny,"" Voldemort said dryly, ""Selwyn and Yaxley both report that you were ripping apart a little boy for the fun of it. I doubt that was in your Orders. Rowle?""


 


""It certainly was not, my Lord. We entered through the Common Rooms to let them know how unsafe they are, but the orders were to fight only those who stood in the way and make their way to the communal parts of the castle as quickly as possible, where we knew the most important members would be. I was able to cast the spell on their strategist, Ron Weasley, then signaled the withdrawal as you wished,"" Rowle explained cautiously.


 


Lord Voldemort glared down from his dais. ""You are fortunate, Dolohov, that your unique enjoyment of the things we do is still useful to me. However, I think you will be tonight's entertainment. I'm sure Healer Zabini will get you back in shape tomorrow."" 


 


Looking up and around, Voldemort's eyes landed on Blaise's bowed head. ""There you are, Healer. Where is your new apprentice?""


 


Blaise felt the sweat sliding down his back. Even when he wasn't forced to directly lie about anything, it was terrifying to be under the Dark Lord's direct scrutiny. ""He is tending the rest of your army, my Lord. Many who made it back were gravely injured. I will have to do the majority of the healing, but he is able to tend minor wounds and administer potions. I knew that you would need my dedication here.""


 


""Of course,"" Voldemort said, smiling. ""Please do help Selwyn and Amycus. They're the worst of the lot that came back. We've lost Crabbe and more guards than I care to think about. I don't appreciate my soldiers being used as fodder."" It seemed he was done with Blaise. The Dark Lord continued, ""Rowle. While your plan was admirable and I appreciate that you accomplished the task I set you, you must be punished for losing so many of my people.""


 


Blaise shuddered at the thought of what Voldemort might do next, even as he focused on healing the internal injuries Selwyn had sustained from a curse. It had been something complex and Blaise wondered who among the Order was now throwing spells like that. If they got much darker, they were going to be as bad as the Death Eaters. He wasn't sure that was such a bad thing, but he wondered how Charlie might take it. Blaise already feared how he was going to take the news that Hogwarts had been breached and that his little brother had been cursed by something Voldemort himself had ordered.


 


He was only vaguely listening when something caught his attention. Lord Voldemort was saying, ""And of course you will need to lose one of your pets. I hear you have been very much enjoying the former Lady Malfoy.""


 


""I have, my Lord. Your gifts are generous,"" Rowle acknowledged.


 


""Unfortunately, you don't deserve her and I will leave you just with the wolf's bitch. Fail me again and I'll give that one to Rookwood.""


 


""I will not fail you again,"" Rowle vowed. Blaise heard determination in his tone. For all that the man was horrible, he did seem to care about Tonks in his own twisted way. 


 


Blaise was relieved that it wouldn't be necessary to work around Narcissa now when helping Tonks. Though he would need to check in on her as well if she had been enjoying Rowle's not-so-tender attentions. Blaise began making mental notes about everyone who needed his help in the next day or so. Exhaustion was already settling over him like a cloak, but there was nothing to do but keep going. Too many people were counting on him.


Please do let me know what you think! We will be seeing plenty more of Draco and Hermione both in the next chapter. This attack just needed to happen to move things along from here.

Hello again! I think this is another trigger-free chapter. 

I have signed up for far too many fests lately. I still *plan* to get the next chapter out in 2 weeks as scheduled, but if I don't manage it, that's what I'm up to. Be on the lookout for some absolutely bizarre fest stories over the next month or so. LOL

I wish to thank my always amazing alpha, omnenomnom. I would be remiss in not mentioning that StarGirlPotter is helping me in the ideas department as well, these days, and I appreciate her deeply as well. My beta, highlyintelligentblonde, has been a great help, too! I couldn't do this without my team.

I still don't own Harry Potter.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Tuesday, June 9th, late morning







""Where have you been?"" Ginny demanded as Severus walked slowly up the hill to the castle. He started to make a snide remark about not having to answer to the brats he had taught, but then he really took her in. 


 


The girl's skin was pale, with blood and bruises covering her arms, legs, and even a cut on her face. Her clothes were torn in a couple of places and she had the exhausted look of someone who had been through entirely too much.


 


""What happened?"" was what came out. A few brief months ago, Severus knew he never would have admitted that he wanted to know, not when it was a Weasley who was in such worrisome condition. But things had changed. 


 


""We were attacked!"" she shouted at him. ""And you weren't here! They think you've done it. Or that you're still a spy. Or... or... I don't know what else they think, but I know they're looking for you and it doesn't look good that you weren't here and Ron was cursed and we don't know what it was.""


 


He held up a basket of plants. ""I was collecting for that calming cake you wanted to try. The Bubbletwig leaves had to be picked in the middle of the night, six nights before the full moon, as you know.""


 


Ginny groaned. ""I do know, but they're not going to listen.""


 


""We could make them all eat some calming cake before we try,"" he suggested, trying a small smile to show he was mostly joking. The girl burst into tears.


 


""Don't make jokes right now, Severus. They're looking for a traitor! People are furious."" 


 


""It won't be the first time I have handled people who are furious,"" he told her more solemnly. ""Come along. Tell me what you know about this curse that hit your brother."" 


 


Severus still loathed the Weasley boy - the ""General"" he thought with an internal sneer - but he knew Ronald was important to the Order's efforts. Personally, he believed there 

had

 to be someone who was better at strategy than that dunderhead, but Severus had to admit he didn't know who that would be.


 


""Madam Pomfrey isn't saying much. I don't think she knows much yet. There were so many who were injured. They only managed to kill a few, but Pomfrey is very busy. Mum... Mum was hit, too. She would have died, and little Teddy with her, if it hadn't been for one of the house elves protecting them."" Ginny was fully sobbing now.


 


""Focus, Ginny,"" Severus snapped, trying to hold back the cursing he wanted to let loose at her babbling. ""What's wrong with your brother?""


 


""He can't seem to move any part of his body or see anything. We're not sure he's hearing right either. Ron keeps calling for all of us but doesn't acknowledge anyone most of the time when they try to say something back to him. He's also been having trouble breathing, but Madam Pomfrey thinks that may be from his ribs breaking rather than the curse."" It all came out in a rush and Severus had to make her repeat parts of it more than once. 


 


Knowing the details was important to keep it from getting worse. Anything like this that was cooked up specially by one of the Dark Lord's loyal followers needed to be counteracted immediately. His long legs were covering the ground into the castle and toward the hospital wing as fast as he could go. Severus was impressed by how well Ginny was keeping up. Had the child grown again lately?


 


""Stop!"" Kingsley commanded just as they were finally arriving. Severus felt his eyebrow twitching in irritation. 


 


""For what purpose?"" Severus inquired. ""My services are needed inside."" He gestured to the hospital wing.


 


""He has to see if he knows the curse they put on Ron!"" Ginny said frantically.


 


The look Kingsley gave Severus could easily kill. He ignored Ginny. ""I don't think so. We need to know where you've been.""


 


Severus sighed. ""Collecting ingredients for something,"" he told the man impatiently. ""You may interrogate me as much as you like 

after

 I assess the boy.""


 


""Do you seriously think we're letting you - a Death Eater - anywhere near the people who have already been compromised by your companions?"" a hard voice snarled. 


 


Looking up, he was shocked to see Neville Longbottom. The boy looked like he had been through hell and back. Again. His eyes were so dark with anger that he hardly looked human. Actually, Severus knew exactly where he had seen that look in someone's eyes - Bellatrix. Madness. 


 


""Stand down, Neville,"" Kingsley commanded. The boy didn't back away at all. He had his wand drawn and he looked like he was a hair's breadth from using it. 


 


""What are you doing?"" Ginny cried, though the boy reacted so little to her that Severus wasn't sure he had even heard.


 


""Neville!"" Kingsley snapped again before turning back. Severus saw worry in his eyes and a moment of understanding passed between the two men. 


 


""If you had anything to do with this... Anything to do with my Gran dying, I'll boil you alive in one of your own cauldrons.""


 


Severus was a bit taken aback by the colorful imagery the once-timid Gryffindor had used. They were all changing so quickly. He didn't know how to keep up with it all.


 


""I can assure you I have no association with the group of people who believe me dead because they think they killed me. Nor do I have any desire to return to the wretched job of spying on or for anyone,"" he said. Honestly, he tried not to sound irritated about it, but he could only do so much.


 


""We'll need to test you with Veritaserum again,"" Kingsley said with a sigh. Severus knew this was one more thing he didn't want to deal with any more than Severus did. 


 


It was that knowledge that made him agree. ""Use it, then. Quickly, before it's too late to stop the curse from spreading.""


 


Neville had already disappeared and returned with the potion vial before Severus had finished agreeing to use it. 3 drops were administered and he began answering the questions. It didn't take as long as he had feared it might to soothe Kingsley's worries. 


 


He had been in the area of the Forbidden Forest just inside the Fidelius. He had to be because if he left, he didn't know the secret and wouldn't be able to return. There had been no one else there. It was the middle of the night after all. Yes, he could explain each of the ingredients he gathered and what they were for. And he did, since merely saying so apparently wasn't enough. 


 


Finally, the man was satisfied and the young man beside him, though still glaring, gave a reluctant nod as well. 


 


Severus swept quickly into the hospital wing. Any who looked up and saw him gave him wary glares. He was used to the condemnation, but it did make his desire to help them flicker just a bit. It was the look in Ginny's eyes that kept him moving toward her arsehole of a brother. He was in a bed right beside Pomfrey's office. His mother was resting in the bed next to his. She looked pale and worn in a way that Severus actually found rather worrying. Setting it aside for the moment, he approached Ronald's bed.


 


""Madam Pomfrey,"" he said, tilting his head briefly in deference to her. 


 


""Severus,"" she said, relief in her voice. ""I've never seen this one before. I hope you have."" A swoop of her wand and a complex set of diagnostics hovered above the unconscious boy.


 


They were soon murmuring together, doing their best to figure out the complexities of the curse. More than an hour passed before Severus had enough information to hazard a guess. This seemed to be a curse Dolohov had worked on before the Battle - the first one, that is - of Hogwarts, before Severus had ""died."" 


 


""It causes a debilitating disease, paralyzing parts of the body.""


 


""What of the fact that he can't see or hear?""


 


Severus shifted uncomfortably. ""That wasn't part of the curse when I was still there. So I don't know. It may just be additional malice, more harm caused. Or there may be a specific purpose. With Dolohov it's hard to tell.""


 


""Can we stop it?"" Madam Pomfrey asked.


 


""I should be able to reverse it with a potion, given some time. The good news is that it's not anything that's spreading,"" he said. That part was a relief. He had expected it to spread. 


 


""The bad news is?"" Ginny prompted. Severus had forgotten she was still sitting there, pale and drawn, listening to every word they said. 


 


Pursing his lips in distaste, he said, ""The bad news is that it 

will 

take time. And we aren't completely sure we haven't missed something in our assessment of his health.""


 


Madam Pomfrey shot him a disapproving look. She would not have given Ginny so much information, he knew. Which is exactly why he had done it. The girl deserved to know. These weren't the children Madam Pomfrey was accustomed to working on. These were soldiers, warriors. Take your pick, but they didn't need to be babied any longer. ""I will continue to check his diagnostics, Miss Weasley. I'm certain we will locate any further maladies.""


 


Ginny nodded. ""What about Mum?""


 


Severus looked away when he saw the sad look in Madam Pomfrey's eyes. Mrs. Weasley might be another bane of his existence, but there was something about her that made the thought of her dying rather distressing. And he could see that it was inevitable, no matter how Pomfrey might sugar coat it.


 


Unable to stand the emotional barrage that was sure to follow no matter what words Pomfrey said, Severus retreated toward his potions lab with the notes he had taken on Weasley's condition. What he wouldn't give to know who their spy on the Death Eaters side was and be able to request information.


 


**************


 


Draco had been nervous at first - afraid his disguise wouldn't hold or someone would notice that the transfigured pillow wasn't actually him. Soon, though, he was too busy to worry about that. They had decided on Drew as his official Healer Apprentice name. Lots of people knew it now and were calling out to either himself or Blaise. 


 


He hadn't yet had time to find out what happened. It was obviously bad, but most of the soldiers they were treating were so out of it, they couldn't explain. They were all more afraid of Lord Voldemort than whatever did this to them anyway. Knowing their great Lord, 

he

 probably did a lot of this damage.


 


Draco had run back into the lab to grab some more blood replenishing potion when he saw a flash of red hair. ""What are you doing coming out of there?"" he hissed at Charlie.


 


""I think you have my recruit,"" Charlie said. ""The one on the second bed to the end with the sandy blond hair. His name is Bart.""


 


Immediately understanding why Charlie had risked poking his head out, Draco nodded with a sly smile. ""Opportunities shouldn't be overlooked.""


 


Charlie smiled back. ""They certainly shouldn't.""


 


""I'll handle it,"" Draco told him quietly. ""There are too many people here for you to risk being seen. Get back in the room.""


 


For a moment, it looked like Charlie would argue, but then he nodded and disappeared. Draco gave a relieved sigh and headed back out into the infirmary. Blaise was working his way along the line of beds where the worst injuries were. Draco had been of little help to those, but there were plenty of others who he could be of use with. Watching Blaise sway on his feet, he was glad he could finally do something useful instead of just watching or laying their comatose. 


 


Speaking of that, he needed to find a way to get Bart into his bed and polyjuiced into himself. Thankfully, the man was hurt badly enough that there was no danger he would spontaneously walk out while Draco was busy with something else. But it would take some careful planning to see him moved without anyone else catching on. 


 


Initially he was thinking that Blaise could help, but considering the man's feelings about Charlie actually joining the guards, he wasn't sure that would work. Knowing what had just happened to the very man Charlie was going to become probably wouldn't help either. Blaise was going to be furious with him, but Draco knew this needed to happen. Charlie wasn't going to give up on his idea to get people out and the best way to do that was to work from the inside. 


 


As he poured dittany over smaller wounds and cast more 

Episkeys

 than he could count, Draco debated. The idea he came up with was simple, but he hoped that was a sign it would work more easily. Not that anything else tended to be easy, but he could hope.


 


As the last of the easy injuries finally left, Draco looked over to see what Blaise was doing. He was thoroughly distracted with a patient and the others he had worked with were unconscious. It was for healing purposes, Draco now knew. After a traumatic injury, it was best to sleep even if magic had healed you. No doubt the people who had left were instructed to sleep as soon as they got to their bunks. 


 


He felt a moment of guilt that moving the real Bart might damage him somehow, but he squashed it down. He would have plenty of rest time under the effects of the Draught of Living Death.


 


Keeping one eye on Blaise, Draco disillusioned the stocky young man. With some simple wand work, he let the transfiguration on the pillow revert back so that the bed was available again and momentarily look-alike-free. Thanking Merlin that Bart had ended up in a bed not far away from his own, Draco floated him into place. For the moment, he just glamoured the man's head to a platinum blond, turned the body toward the wall, and pulled the blankets up to hide the rest of him.


 


Hurrying, Draco made it into the lab and moved potions bottles around until he found the stashes of Polyjuice and Draught of Living Death. Momentarily letting his own glamour go in case it might affect the outcome, he pulled a hair and added it to the Polyjuice Potion. Draco threw the glamour back on himself and headed back to his bed. He turned the unconscious Bart over and fed him the two potions. Watching the body morph into a perfect imitation of his own was creepy, but he appreciated the efficiency. 


 


It occurred to him that mixing the Draught of Living Death with whatever sleeping potion Blaise had given the man might not have been a good idea, but he couldn't really bring himself to care. Noting that Blaise was still busy, Draco quickly floated the fellow in the last bed to the one where Bart had previously been, then flicked his wand to vanish the last bed so it wouldn't look like one was unoccupied when it shouldn't be. Blaise would know what he had done soon enough. No reason to have him upset while he was still working.


 


Finally, he slid down the wall and sat with his head in his hands, appreciating how good it felt to be this tired for a real reason. There had been people who needed help and 

he

 had a hand in helping them. If Blaise had more time to teach him, he might have been even more useful, could be that in the future. 


 


""I think that's the last of them,"" Blaise said, sinking down against the wall to sit next to Draco on the floor. There were no empty beds now and they were both too exhausted to continue standing. It was dark beyond the window. They had been at it all day.


 


""What the bloody hell happened?"" Draco asked. ""I've seen this place get a couple of visitors after a raid now and then, but nothing like this.""


 


""They attacked Hogwarts.""


 


""What!?"" Draco shouted loudly enough that he woke at least one of the infirmary patients. There was a grunt and a muttered, ""Shut up,"" before the man shifted and fell back to snoring.


 


""Nott figured out some way to go through a floo. Any floo they know the address for, whether it's open or closed,"" Blaise explained.


 


""Without having to hitch a ride with someone?"" Draco asked. He heard the panic in his own voice at the same time he was becoming aware of how fast and frantically his heart was beginning to beat.


 


""Yeah,"" Blaise said morosely. It was bad news and he obviously hadn't wanted to have to share it. ""For as bad as it looks here, the order-""


 


""Hermione!"" Draco cried. He pulled himself off the ground and began to pace. His muscles were shaky from overuse, but he couldn't sit, not right now.  ""Has she-""


 


""Calm down. If she had been hurt, I'm sure the arseholes would have been gloating about it,"" Blaise pointed out logically. 


 


But Draco was in no mood for logic. ""Even if she wasn't this time, she could be next time! You know they'll go again. And what if they hurt her and just didn't realize it was her?""


 


Blaise almost looked amused at where his mind had immediately gone, but then he grimaced. ""I suppose with all the recruits they sent, that's possible.""


 


""Then she could be hurt and she's still in danger either way,"" Draco stated logically. ""I have to do something!"" At least he managed to only whisper-shout this time instead of doing it outright.


 


""Draco. We can't do anything about it right now. Maybe you'll see her in your sleep tonight,"" Blaise suggested.


 


""Sleep! You should give me a potion and I'll see her now.""


 


""Not if she isn't sleeping,"" Blaise pointed out. 


 


""It's night. She probably is,"" Draco argued.


 


Blaise looked thoughtful. ""Unless they've heard about the attack. Then she's probably stretching that brain of hers to keep it from happening again.""


 


""Merlin, she'll be a target!""


 


""A new one, perhaps,"" Blaise agreed absentmindedly. He was looking half-asleep now.


 


""There was a target this time?"" Draco asked.


 


""The Weasel. He was their strategist.""


 


""Fuck. Are you serious? No wonder they're losing,"" Draco scoffed.


 


Blaise reached his long arm over and lightly smacked the back of Draco's head. ""He's apparently pretty good. We have a spy or two in Hogwarts, it seems, yet he's kept most people alive. I'm not even sure they're losing.""


 


""With Snape dead, do you think they have another spy here in the Manor?"" Draco worried. ""How else will they get information?""


 


""If they didn't before, they do now,"" Blaise said. 


 


Draco was even more tired than he had thought, because he looked over at Blaise with confusion until his friend rolled his eyes and said, ""You.""


 


""Me?""


 


""You can relay information to Hermione,"" Blaise explained slowly.


 


Scoffing, Draco said, ""If I know it in time. And if we both happen to be asleep at the right time to get the message through."" He dropped his head in his hands. ""Merlin, if I had known, I could have warned her. What if she's hurt?"" He couldn't let go of that possibility.


 


""It's a limited system, yes,"" Blaise agreed, ignoring Draco's last question, ""But it's better than nothing.""


 


""I don't care about that right now,"" Draco growled in frustration. ""I want to know if she is hurt! Damn it!""


 


""In the past when something was wrong on her end, didn't you know about it? Not what it was, but that she was hurt or distressed?""


 


Draco paused, realizing Blaise was right. 


 


""You don't feel anything bad from her right now, do you?"" he prodded.


 


Concentrating, Draco reached out along the stretched string of magic that ran to her, wherever she was. He felt nothing out of the ordinary. She was either sleeping or just not feeling anything too strongly. For a moment, his head clouded with the image of her reading in a library. A surge of longing rushed through him and Draco felt like he couldn't breathe.


 


When he managed to look up, Blaise was looking at him oddly. Draco wasn't sure how to explain himself, so he just said, ""No, I think she's fine. She must not even know about it or there would be... something.""


 


They were quiet for a moment before Blaise said, ""She's not at Hogwarts, then.""


 


Draco's eyes widened. He hadn't considered that there might be a way to figure out where she was. Not without following the thread of magic, which he was determined not to do. Even if he hated her as much as he wished he did, Draco wouldn't lead Voldemort to her.


 


A sudden feeling of panic and fury almost overwhelmed him. He choked over the words as he clutched at the dark spot above his heart and said, ""I think she knows now.""


 


************


 


""What do you mean, 'attacked'?"" Hermione asked, her heart fluttering with fear. The warding book she had been reading was on the floor where she had dropped it when Harry ran in, frantically trying to communicate the information he had. She couldn't decide now if she should jump up or not. This felt like a moment for action, but what could they 

do

 from here? She felt frozen with indecision, a state she hated.


 


Harry was running his hands through his wild hair as he started speaking again. ""She didn't tell me anything else, but I've never seen Dromeda look panicked like that!"" 


 


At the nearby table, Theo set down the quill he had been scrawling notes with and stood. ""Is she still here?""


 


""No. She was headed out. Told me Hogwarts had been attacked and to stay put.""


 


Hermione blinked. She felt like she was a few steps behind. No matter how many times Harry said it, she just couldn't believe Hogwarts had been attacked when it was under the Fidelius. Unless it had failed - but Snape and McGonagall had figured it out together and used a group casting to secure it. Had something happened to the Secret Keeper? Had something happened to Ginny? Neville? George? Baby Teddy? She shook her head, trying to focus on the two boys in front of her rather than letting herself panic about all the people in the castle. 


 


""I'm sure Kingsley and Ron would have let us know if we were needed to fight,"" Hermione said, but she knew her voice was shaking. 


 


""Would they?"" Harry said, his green eyes meeting hers. ""You and I have been removed for our own protection. They don't want me in a fight until I'm ready to take down Voldy and you're pregnant.""


 


It seemed Harry would have gone on, but Theo interrupted. ""They would have called on the recruits we have here if it were that dire.""


 


""I wouldn't stay,"" Harry said. He looked both panicked and outraged at the idea.


 


Theo snorted. ""Of course you wouldn't, but they would tell you to. If the attack were bad enough, they would need the back-up too much to ignore a whole contingent of fighters.""


 


Harry looked contemplative for a moment, nodding to himself as he processed what Theo said. 


 


""Did you say Andromeda went out?"" Hermione asked. She realized as she said it that the question had potential to undo what little calming Theo had managed on Harry so far. Theo clearly thought so, too, based on the irritated look he shot her.


 


""She was carrying a broom,"" Harry said. He seemed to be growing more frantic again. Theo stepped over to him and put a hand on Harry's shoulder. 


 


""Let's go down to the kitchen. I'll make tea,"" Theo suggested in a tone that made it clear that's what they were going to do. 


 


Thankful for some sort of direction, Hermione stood, too. Harry still seemed resistant, but once she slid her arm through his and began to follow Theo, he went along with it. By the time the two of them made it downstairs, Theo had the teacups made and sitting at their favorite spots. Despite the rather grand Great Hall the manor had adjusted to Harry's liking, the kitchen was still a preferred spot for him when he could get away with it.


 


Hermione sat down next to Harry and took a sip of her tea. Harry did the same next to her, but he sputtered and nearly spit it out. Theo grinned where he was leaning against the counter and sipped his tea. 


 


""What did you put in this?"" a wide-eyed Harry asked.


 


""Bit of firewhiskey. Maybe a bit of Calming Draught. Thought you could use both,"" Theo answered nonchalantly.


 


""Theo! What if they interact badly?"" Hermione scolded, feeling a surge of protectiveness for Harry. She pursed her lips when he chugged the rest of his cup of tea and held it out to Theo with a gesture of more.


 


As he prepared the tea, Theo carefully said, ""I've mixed the two together on many occasions. Almost always for better than worse.""


 


""When?"" she demanded, thinking he was just saying that to make her drop it. Hermione rather liked Theo, but sometimes she wasn't sure he was telling her the complete truth.


 


He paused, staring at the floor for a moment before he met her eyes and said, ""Before Mum died,"" then turned away.


 


Harry gave her an exasperated look and Hermione felt her cheeks burn. She hadn't meant to imply anything that would hurt him. ""Theo, I...""


 


""It was a long time ago. Don't worry about it,"" he said, turning back with a smile on his face that she knew he didn't mean.


 


For once, Hermione decided to keep her mouth shut rather than chance making things worse. She just didn't know enough about Theo to be sure that anything she said wouldn't upset him more. It was Harry who broke the silence.


 


""Dromeda must have gone to the castle by broom. I wonder how far it is. I've never been outside the wards here, so I actually have no idea where we are.""


 


""Harry James Potter, you are not leaving this Manor,"" Hermione demanded. She could hear the possibility in his tone.


 


He scowled at her, but sipped his doctored tea instead of responding. She could see that it was starting to relax him. Theo, too, was relaxing as Harry did, his eyes never leaving their volatile friend. 


 


""Do you think they're okay?"" Harry asked morosely. ""Ginny and Ron? Teddy? I know he was the one Dromeda was most worried about. I am, too."" Harry was fidgeting with something he had pulled from his pocket. 


 


""What is that you have?"" Theo asked, ignoring Harry's unanswerable questions.


 


Harry looked down like he'd never seen his hands or what was in them. With a puzzled look on his face, he set the object on the table. It was some sort of amulet. Nothing fancy, but made of a delicate rose gold. It was a hexagon with an engraved heart - a scientific depiction of one - on the front. Hermione thought it was odd to see that on a magical creation, but that only made her more interested. It was on a matching delicate chain and had a clasp that suggested it was a locket as well.


 


Slowly, Harry seemed to recognize it. ""This is from the Heart of the Manor,"" he said, confusion marring his brow. ""I thought I left it all there on the desk by accident.""


 


""Except the rings you got stuck on,"" Hermione grumbled. She still hadn't figured out how to remove the unknown one or found a spell that would identify what it did. At least the other seemed to be a family Signet ring, so probably harmless.


 


""Yes, except those,"" Harry agreed absently as he picked up the necklace and turned it over in his hands again, ""But I don't know how I still have this. And I think... I'm not sure, but I think it's been in my pocket ever since.""


 


""You haven't been wearing the same clothes,"" Theo pointed out. Hermione could tell his interest was sparked. The boy loved a puzzle.


 


""No, I haven't,"" Harry mused. ""Maybe I've been switching it over with me?"" He shrugged, seeming to lose interest, though his fingers were still playing with it. ""Do you think there's anything useful we can do right now?""


 


Hermione bit her lip. ""We could brew some healing potions. If they aren't needed right now, they will be sometime.""


 


""

You,

 Harry, can brew some potions,"" Theo said, his voice imbued with that strange commanding tone he got sometimes, ""Hermione, you and I have to finish out the first warding ritual. Immediately.""


 


""Do you think better wards would have kept this from happening?"" she asked. She was trembling at the thought, but she knew it was only logical that that would be true. 


 


""Until we know more, there's no way to tell,"" Theo said grimly, ""But this proves the castle is still vulnerable. If we have the ritual mostly worked out, we can add whatever happened this time once we know more, if it's not already covered anyway.""


 


Hermione nodded. That was sensible. She would work on the wording of the ritual and let Theo plan the wandwork. They would handle the additional aspects together. Loathe as she once would have been to admit it, the two of them made a wonderful team. 


 


Sighing, she followed the boys to the progressively larger potions lab. When they entered this time, it included a nice library table and their books on warding had already moved themselves down. The three of them settled into their tasks, trying to ignore the worry of waiting.


 

What do you think is going on with Ron's curse? How are they going to counter it?

Are you expecting any particular kind of ritual for the initial Hogwarts warding? I'm so interested to see what you might be anticipating.

No trigger warnings for this one. I don't think there's even anything I need to talk about. Enjoy!

Thank you to my alpha, Omnenomnom, and my beta, highlyintelligentblonde.

I still don't own Harry Potter!

Wednesday, June 10th; morning


""Why didn't you warn me?"" Hermione demanded the moment she arrived in the clearing. 


 


It appeared that Draco had been waiting for her, perhaps for some time considering the way he was pacing.


 


His head jerked up at the sound of her voice and he was across the clearing with his arms around her before Hermione had time to stop gaping at his movement. She was crushed against his chest and couldn't help the fact that her nose was buried in the crook of his neck. He smelled amazing, the perfect combination of spices and apples and something masculine that was purely him. She was shocked to realize that he was shaking.


 


""You're okay. Fine. Alive,"" he murmured, ""I've been fucking worried sick that you've gone and done somthing idiotically Griffindor.""


 


""You've been worried about me?"" Hermione was so stunned she forgot to even sound derisive.


 


""I-"" 


 


It seemed that her doubt made him realize what he was doing since he suddenly released her and stepped back like he had been slapped. His hands slipped into his trouser pockets and he looked away. Hermione had never seen Malfoy look so sheepish.


 


Instead of really answering her question, he spoke in his sarcastic, dismissive tone, with a sneer on his face that seemed oddly forced. ""Of course you're fine. You would have taken my magic again if you were in trouble."" His tone was bitter at the end.


 


Hermione had been intent on making him talk about his worry and where the hell that had come from, but she was distracted by the end of his sentence. ""Taken? Yes, I might have 

asked 

for your magic if I needed help, but I would never just take it. That's not how this works.""


 


He glared at her and sneered, ""If you say so. It's easy for you to say that when you're safe and standing in my rose garden,"" before storming away to resume pacing.


 


""I wouldn't exactly consider the rose garden at Malfoy Manor safe,"" Hermione huffed to herself. But he either didn't hear her or ignored that statement as he turned heel and stalked the other direction. 


 


She watched him for a moment, observing the tension in his muscles like a snake coiling to strike. While it should have been terrifying, she realized she didn't feel endangered by him in any way. Instead, she felt the creepingly familiar sense of worry that she frequently carried for Ro-... Harry. Just Harry now. Usually she fixed it with a hug and a late night talk in the common room; she doubted Malfoy would respond well to that.


 


In the end, she finally settled on, ""If you were so worried about me, why didn't you tell me it was going to happen so we could have been prepared? "" There was no reason for him to be so helpful, but she was curious and more than a bit hurt, as silly as it sounded considering the circumstances. But the last time she had seen him here she had healed him... somewhat. As much as she could. She had thought they had reached some sort of accord. That may it meant something to him...


 


""I didn't know!"" Draco paced over and dropped down on the edge of the fountain. He ran his fingers through his hair and tugged on it.


 


""Stop it,'' Hermione hissed, smacking his hands away from their tugging on instinct. ""You'll go bald.""


 


""That is the very least of my worries right now, Granger,"" he groaned but let his hands fall to his side.


 


""I just don't see how you couldn't know. There we so many,"" she gasped as the possibility occurred to her, ""Were you--""


 


""No! No. Still reportedly in a coma,"" He cut her off, ""Even if I weren't, when I let you go I destroyed what little standing I had with the Dark Lord. I doubt he'd let me into a battle unless he was certain it would hurt me. I'm only alive because I'm the last of my bloodline and he'll be locked out of the Manor if he kills me."" He laughed mirthlessly. ""Unless he imperiused and obliviated me into siring a bastard I don't know about. Still, I suppose I would have a few months left to live before the poor wretch was born.""


 


Hermione's heart stuttered and it took everything in her to keep from placing a hand on her belly. Thank Merlin she wasn't showing yet. She hadn't even thought about... But now was not the time.


 


When she didn't respond he seemed to take it as some sort of condemnation. ""I 

didn't

 know. But believe what you want. I don't care!""  


 


He started to stand and Hermione's hand shot out on instinct, catching his wrist. He froze and to be honest so did she, entirely unprepared for the surge of warmth radiating from his skin. He sat back down gracefully, as if his legs had lost the will to hold his body up and she forced herself to retract her hand. Instead she cleared her throat, focusing on information.


 


""So you didn't know what was going to happen because you're pretending to be in a coma?"" she asked. She was a little skeptical, but she supposed it was possible. ""Why are you telling me about it now?""


 


""Because I need to help if I can,"" he said. The frustration in his voice was intense.


 


""You want to help?"" she asked, almost convinced her hearing was failing.


 


""Of course I do. Merlin, we have to... the Dark Lord can't win. He would kill you, Her- Granger. He'd kill all of us sooner or later.""


 


""So this is to keep yourself alive; self preservation,"" she said, feeling like she finally understood. But then the look he gave her, like something inside him was dying, made her uncertain again.


 


""I wouldn't want you to... I don't... If I had known when we last talked, I would have told you,"" he answered, getting progressively softer. Then he seemed to steel himself and said, ""That's what we're going to do here from now on. I won't always know things ahead of time, but any information I can get, I will give you.""


 


""You're going to, what, spy on the Death Eaters for us?""


 


""If you want to call it that."" 


 


""What do you want to call it?"" Hermione asked sternly. ""I have no time for traitors. We're at war. There are no second chances. I need to know why you're doing this so that I can know how trustworthy you are, or if you'll turn tail at the first sign of trouble.""


 


""I think we're well past trouble at this point,"" he scoffed.


 


""Malfoy. Give me your reasoning now. If you want to bargain for clemency for you or your family we should start negotiations now.""


 


""Sure, my family. Good enough?"" 


 


""Your mother?"" Hermione asked, her voice soft. ""I don't think there is much we could do for your father at this point but maybe-""


 


""My mother has disowned me. My father is-"" Malfoy snarled and looked off to the side. 


 


""Oh. I'm-"" She started an apology only to let the words die on her lips. She 

wasn't

 sorry to learn Lucius Malfoy was dead, and the look on Malfoy's face told her he wouldn't appreciate the fake sympathy. ""I mean... some cousins then? Or perhaps...""


 


""No,"" he sighed, burying his hand in his hair again. She reached for it again and he dropped it back to his side and sent her a glare.


 


""I'm not well versed in your family tree, Malfoy. Perhaps you could assist? Otherwise I will just start listing purebloods I know.""


 


""It's 

you!"" 

he emphasized, though he seemed very unhappy about it. 


 


Hermione had no idea what to say or do in response. She knew she should come up with something grateful to say, but all she could think was the word that tumbled out of her mouth. ""Why?""


 


""Because... Merlin, you're infuriating! You're my wife, by magic and law! I can't just stand by and let you get hurt,"" he shouted at her. 


 


In most cases, she probably would have shouted right back, or walked up and slapped him like he deserved. But all Hermione could do in that moment was stare. She finally gathered her wits and said in a small voice, ""I wasn't even 

at

 Hogwarts.""


 


""But you could have been. I don't 

know 

where you are, so I just have to sit here and worry-""


 


""I'm at-""


 


""For fuck's sake, don't 

tell

 me where you are! I don't need to know, Hermione. I don't 

want

 to know! Anything I know, he could get!"" Malfoy was working himself into a panic by the look of things. Before she could say anything to try and calm him down, he was up pacing again. ""I'm at the Dark Lord's mercy here. And if - more likely 

when

 - he catches on to what I've been doing, he's not likely to go easy on me.""


 


""I was just going to tell you I'm somewhere safe,"" she said indignantly. Then taking in the rest of what he said, she asked, ""Wouldn't it make more sense for you to lay low and not do something foolhardy like spying while you're supposed to be in bed?""


 


""Did a Gryffindor just suggest I not be foolhardy?"" He seemed so incredulous, he almost quit his pacing. 


 


Hermione was surprised by how much that relieved her. When he smirked a little, she found herself smiling back. ""You have to admit it seems a bit out of your wheelhouse.""


 


He shrugged. ""The least dreadful Weasley is rubbing off on me more than you might imagine,"" Malfoy said casually with something that looked like an actual smile.


 


""Charlie?"" she asked. It was utterly bizarre to her that the two knew each other at all, much less that they might be friends. Though she supposed if anyone could manage it, it would be Charlie. 


 


""No, I invited your Weasel over for tea,"" Malfoy said, rolling his eyes at her dramatically. 


 


Hermione flinched but covered it by brushing off her dress. ""How are you hiding him?"" she asked. ""Charlie that is.""


 


Hermione had been dying to know how they were managing it.


 


""We had this secret room. I mean, we still do, but he's not hiding there anymore.""


 


""Secret room?"" she asked curiously before realizing what else he had said. ""Wait. Why isn't Charlie there anymore?""


 


""He's on a... mission he assigned himself,"" Draco said, seeming a little worried about telling her.


 


After a moment, she asked, ""Are you going to tell me more?"" 


 


He shook his head. ""I'm not telling anyone anything that might blow his cover. But he is as safe as he's willing to be and-,"" he said, but suddenly his body was fading away. Hermione reached for him as though she would pull him back, but of course it didn't work.


 


**************


 


""You are 

not 

going!"" Blaise cried, stomping with one foot to emphasize his point. He knew he looked like a child, but he couldn't help it. He didn't have much time before he needed to be back out in the ward, and he couldn't lose this argument.


 


Charlie had his arms crossed, but his expression was a mixture of stubbornness and pain. ""Blaise, we've talked about this. This is something I have to do, and we've been handed a golden opportunity.""


 


""You don't have to do it, you 

want

 to do it. Stupid fucking Gryffindors, always throwing themselves into danger with no regard-""


 


Blaise was cut off by Charlie's lips on his. For a long moment, he protested, not giving in to the distraction. But some part of him knew he wouldn't be able to talk Charlie out of this deception, and he knew there might not be another opportunity for a long time. He tried valiantly to ignore the little voice that suggested there might 

never

 be another chance, if things went wrong. 


 


He ran his fingers through Charlie's loose curls, memorizing the way the other man felt against him, the taste of him. Blaise was pleased by the little sound Charlie made when he tugged at his hair and the way his tongue and lips increased their pressure in response. That wasn't the only response, of course, but Blaise resolutely ignored the hard length pressed next to his own. 


 


No matter how turned on either of them were, how much more Blaise wanted with Charlie, there was no way he would make that move without Charlie explicitly asking for it, either in words or by starting it himself. Even then, Blaise knew it would require caution. 


 


And at the moment, even if Charlie had been ready for it, there was no longer time. If Charlie was going to become this Bart fellow - and as much as he hated it, Blaise knew it was inevitable - they were out of time. He tried to push down the sick feeling he had at the thought that this could be the end even if Charlie didn't get killed in the process of what he was doing. 


 


This man Blaise felt so much for might not care for him in return once he wasn't dependent on him anymore. He could just... leave. And Charlie had every right to. Blaise wanted him to have that freedom. He just... he also wanted Charlie to choose him. 


 


Fighting back his emotions and the tears they wanted to bring forward, Blaise lost himself in the kiss. Charlie seemed to as well, until they were interrupted by the clearing of a throat. 


 


Draco was watching them with his usual smirk, but Blaise had known him long enough to know that the look in his eyes was soft and happy for them. ""Snog faster,"" he drawled. ""The patients will be waking soon."" 


 


Blaise wanted to yell at him like he had earlier, when Draco admitted what he had done with this Bart fellow. Charlie, though, just laughed. It was the hearty laugh Blaise loved that made it difficult not to laugh with him. 


 


Before he could say anything, Charlie pulled him into a tight, rough hug. Was Blaise imagining it or was he trembling just a little?


 


""I'll be back, Blaise. This isn't the end. And I'll be as careful as I can.""


 


The words were murmured straight into his ear and Blaise felt a tingle go down his spine with them. It felt almost like magic. He had heard corny lines about love being that way, but he hadn't believed them until now. 


 


""You better be,"" he choked out. ""I hate this. And I'm still upset with you.""


 


""I know you are,"" Charlie acknowledged. ""But please help me anyway.""


 


""Of course,"" Blaise answered. ""I'm certainly not going to let you get captured by not helping.""


 


With that, Draco handed Charlie a hip flask he had pilfered from the real Bart and filled with polyjuice. Charlie made an awful face as he drank from it, then they all watched as he morphed into someone else. 


 


He was a little taller, far less muscular, and his signature red curls were a short, stick-straight, nondescript brown. His eyes were brown as well. ""Merlin, do you have his glasses?"" Charlie asked. 


 


""Yes, sorry,"" Draco replied, handing them over. 


 


""I guess I'm ready, then,"" Charlie said. He was wearing the man's borrowed clothes. 


 


With a last, awkward squeeze to Blaise's hand, Charlie stepped away and followed Draco out of their secret hiding place. Blaise fought back the tears that wanted to fall and followed as well. 


 


They managed to get him arranged in a bed before any of the others awoke. From Charlie's time observing, they knew that the man three cots down was Bart's tent mate and the most likely to speak with the loner he now was. Sure enough, Daniel asked if he remembered much. 


 


The two talked briefly - ""Bart"" barely remembered a thing, but gathered plenty of information from Daniel about what happened - before Draco and Blaise interrupted to check them over. Blaise knew he should probably make Daniel stay a little longer, but he certainly wasn't going to let Charlie head out to the camp alone, so he released the two together. 


 


Charlie-Bart gave him an arched eyebrow when he had to steady his new friend before they even made it out the door. Blaise hoped the look he sent conveyed that he was going to make Charlie be as careful as he could. The man he loved inclined his head with a grunt as his disguise required, but his eyes told Blaise thank you. 


 


As he left, there was nothing Blaise could do but hope that he wasn't discovered. 


 


*********


 


Hermione woke to the thump of Harry falling off the sofa and Theo's cursing as Harry landed on him.


 


As she raised her head from the table, she cast a 

Scourgify

 on herself to get the ink from her cheek. There were no mirrors about, but she knew what she looked like after falling asleep on a pile of notes. She blinked over at the two boys. ""What are you doing?"" she asked, confused by the fact that neither of them had moved.


 


""Snuggling,"" Theo said snarkily, turning and squirming a bit so that Harry wasn't on top of him anymore, but wrapped in his arms facing Hermione instead. 


 


Harry's emerald eyes were sleepy and, yawning, he agreed, ""Yeah, snuggles are good."" Harry lay his head down on Theo's arm, completely unaware of the shocked look on the other boy's face. 


 


""It was a joke, mate. Get up,"" Theo said, pushing Harry away from him.


 


""No way,"" Harry grumbled. ""You offered and I'm not ready to get up yet."" He wiggled his body to more comfortably fit against Theo who was now backed against the sofa.


 


Theo looked like he might hyperventilate when he said, ""Harry, that's enough. We need to find out if Andromeda made it back.""


 


Eyes snapping open, Harry was up and away from Theo in an instant. His gaze flickered around the room, then he was darting out, undoubtedly searching for the older woman.


 


Hermione got up and began that way as well, but then looked back. ""Are you okay, Theo?"" she asked. He still didn't look like he was breathing very well and his cheeks were flushed. 


 


""Yes. Fine. I'm fine,"" he told her, but his voice was shaking a bit. 


 


""Are you sure-"" she started.


 


""Very,"" he responded, much more harshly than Theo usually spoke. With a determined look, he stood, his face sliding into that perfect pureblood blankness, as he offered her his arm. ""Would you like an escort to breakfast?""


 


Hermione was confused by what had just happened, and she got the impression that Theo really needed some time to gather himself from whatever was wrong. She shook her head slowly. ""No, thank you. I'm going to go see if I can find either Harry or Andromeda or both. I'll see you down there.""


 


""Of course,"" he agreed, then left the room as fast as his long legs could carry him without running. 


 



What was that?

 Hermione wondered. Whatever had upset Theo, she couldn't really focus on it right now. There were too many other things they still needed to get done. Harry had brewed for hours last night while she and Theo worked through the complicated intricacies of the initial warding. It had been long past midnight when they had drug each other out of the lab and into the kitchen. At one point, she suggested they all go to bed, but none of them hadn't really wanted to leave the common areas, in case Andromeda came back and needed help of some kind. 


 


They had compromised by retiring to the library, where there were plenty of comfy places to fall asleep. Of course, only Harry had actually used one. Falling asleep over her notes wasn't unusual for Hermione, but she had no idea how Theo had ended up on the floor by the sofa. Last she recalled, he had been in one of the wingback reading chairs.


 


Hermione wasn't actually planning to search for the others, but she did have some things she wanted to gather from her room. Before Andromeda had allowed her to leave the bed, Hermione had started working on a few items that she hoped would help them all eventually. She hadn't been magically strong enough to finish them, but she could now.


 


The collection she gathered consisted of several notebooks, a couple of necklaces, and as many galleons as she had been able to get her hands on. Sitting on the side of the bed, she pulled out her wand and went to work on the galleons. She was most familiar with them, after all, so adding the modified protean charms to them was a quick job.


 


Before she could move on to the other items, she heard yelling from downstairs. One of the voices was definitely Harry's. Merlin, what now?


 


As Hermione raced down the stairs, she saw Theo coming out of the Great Hall with a number of worried recruits behind him. Harry and Andromeda were facing off in the sitting room. Andromeda looked beyond exhausted. Harry was furious.


 


""You could have sent us some kind of message! Or let us know somehow... I knew you should have told us how to work your... communication thing...""


 


""The one I made you promise not to mention to anyone as discretion is vital?"" Andromeda snapped, any patience she may have had clearly gone.


 


""We've been dying to know what's happening! There was no way to get information!"" Harry shouted.


 


""And no way to send any either,"" Andromeda shouted back. Suddenly, a little wail started from a bundle on her back. Hermione hadn't even noticed until now that what appeared to be a shawl around the older woman was actually a sling to hold baby Teddy. 


 


As Andromeda struggled to turn it around and free him, Hermione rushed forward to help. ""Can I pull him out?"" she asked.


 


""Yes,"" Andromeda answered, showing her how. As Hermione cooed at the 3-month-old now cradled in her arms, Andromeda seemed to hunch over, perhaps relieved to have the extra weight gone. Hermione realized the woman looked much older this morning than she ever had before. 


 


Andromeda conjured a bottle from the pack she had brought and handed it to Hermione. Part of her bristled, wondering if she was being selected simply because she was the pregnant witch in residence. Pregnant. Memories of the rose garden last night that she hadn't had time to analyze yet came tumbling back into focus.


 


Again putting that thought off for another time, she chastised herself. Of course no one was making her tend a baby because she was pregnant. She had rushed to help with Teddy all on her own. And now Andromeda needed her to keep taking care of him while she dealt with an irrational Harry Potter.


 


Hermione searched the crowd for Theo, but he wasn't there anymore. She found herself wishing he were. He was so much better at handling Harry's more volatile moods than she was. Harry was just worried and frustrated and tired, she knew, but he was behaving horribly and the recruits didn't need to see this.


 


That's when she realized most of them were slowly dispersing. She could see Dean waving people outside, but if she listened closely, Theo's voice was somewhere near the back door encouraging everyone to hurry up. Apparently it was time for a training session, no matter how exhausted he was.


 


Relieved, Hermione turned her attention back to Harry and Andromeda. Teddy was suckling at his bottle, though he was still fussing some, especially when Andromeda would raise her voice. Gently snuggling the baby closer, Hermione walked in between the two and spoke quietly, ""I know you're both very tired and there is a lot to be upset about, but you're not accomplishing anything by shouting at one another. Perhaps we should give each other updates instead?""


 


Both of them looked like they were going to argue. She could see the matching stubborn set of their jaws. Finally, though, Andromeda pulled in a deep breath and nodded brusquely. ""That would be more useful,"" she said.


 


""And why don't we do that somewhere we can sit down,"" Hermione suggested gently. ""My back is starting to hurt holding 

two

 babies.""


 


Harry and Andromeda spontaneously turned into coddling mother hens rather than antagonists shouting at one another. It was ridiculous, but useful. Hermione soon found herself back in the library in one of the cushy reading chairs, with a pillow propping Teddy in position on her lap and being served breakfast and tea by Harry. She appreciated his service, and was particularly glad for it since Andromeda finally gave up competing and sat down in a chair of her own. 


 


Hermione could tell she was exhausted. Before the poor woman could fall asleep without telling them what they needed to know, Hermione decided she better start the conversation. ""We tried to keep ourselves busy last night, since we couldn't sleep,"" she began.


 


""What did you do?"" Andromeda asked.


 


""Harry brewed as many healing potions as he could - Wiggenweld, Skelegro, Blood Replenishing Potion, some others I think, but I don't know what,"" she looked to Harry, hoping he would elaborate, but he was still looking stubborn. 


 


Hermione rolled her eyes at him and then explained the rest of the night's preparation. ""Theo and I have been working on the warding problem for ages, as you know,"" she said. ""We were close already, but with... whatever happened... we decided to use our time to finish it.""


 


""Is it done?"" Andromeda had perked up considerably with this information.


 


""Yes, I believe it is. There are a few things to gather, but we can be ready within a day or so,"" Hermione informed her.


 


""Thank Merlin,"" Andromeda said, slumping back into her chair. 


 


""Why?"" Harry asked, softly this time.


 


""What do you mean 'why?'"" Andromeda snapped at him.


 


He sighed. ""I'm sorry, Dromeda. I shouldn't have acted like that.""


 


""No, you certainly should not. I am... beyond disappointed that you mentioned I have a way to communicate. Especially now."" Her voice quavered on the last statement.


 


""Why? What's happened?"" Hermione asked, heart in her throat.


 


""As Harry no doubt informed you, Hogwarts was attacked. They came in through the floos, much the way they did at Shell Cottage with you, Hermione,"" she explained, ""But here, no one had come through before. They were able to enter any floo they knew the address for, without needing to 'hitch a ride' as they did before. We're not sure, but it didn't even seem like all the ones they used were attached to the floo network at all.""


 


""Where did they enter?"" Harry asked, worry in his voice.


 


""The Common Rooms, a contingent of fighters to each. And then some came through the Great Hall. They all left that way.""


 


Hermione gasped. The Great Hall's fireplace - she was almost certain it wasn't attached to the network. Then her mind focused on the Common Rooms. Where they could get to people who were sleeping. Merlin, they had access to 

everyone.



 


Harry must have been thinking along the same lines, because his voice was shaking when he asked, ""Is everyone okay? Were there any..."" he paused, steeling himself, ""any casualties?""


 


Andromeda sighed. ""There was a young man in Gryffindor. None of the Death Eaters who entered there made it into the rest of the castle, though one got back out through the floo. Augusta Longbottom."" Andromeda's voice broke on that one and Harry was suddenly by her side, pulling the older woman into a hug as Hermione's mind spun, thinking about poor Neville.


 


She sobbed for several long moments before pulling away from Harry. Andromeda was staring across to Hermione and Teddy when she said, ""I almost lost him. Teddy. They were attacked - he and Molly. A house elf saved them. Well, saved Teddy completely. He doesn't have a scratch. Molly...""


 


""Is something wrong with Mrs. Weasley?"" Harry asked sharply. Hermione could see the fear in his eyes. 


 


Andromeda's eyes looked unfathomably sad. ""She was frail ever since the battle... the previous battle. Whatever curse Bellatrix hit her with, it took a lot out of Molly. This one seemed to zap her strength even more. They didn't realize at first. She was so worried about Ron that she was pushing through the pain. Madam Pomfrey believes she may have made it worse by not getting treatment until after she collapsed. She had left Mimsy minding Teddy when the Death Eaters were all gone, so no one knew what had happened until later.""


 


""Mimsy?"" Hermione asked, voice small. She hadn't thought about the little elf in some time, but somehow knowing she had protected Molly and this darling baby in her arms filled Hermione with an odd guilt. She was happy to be distracted when Harry spoke over her.


 


""So Mrs. Weasley's okay,"" Harry said with relief, ""just a little drained and weak.""


 


""Harry, Hermione,"" Andromeda's voice was pitying, ""Molly Weasley is a very strong woman, and she'll fight to be here with her children - including the two of you - for as long as she possibly can - but she is dying.""


 


""No!"" Harry shouted, startling Teddy out of his near-sleep state and making Hermione glare at him. As she got Teddy to settle back down, Harry paced. ""I'm sorry. Just. Mrs. Weasley has to be okay. She's like... she's like the mother I never got to have.""


 


""She's 

a

 mother, yes, Harry,"" Andromeda agreed softly, ""but she's nothing like 

your

 mother. I'm glad you had her in your life to show you what a good mother could be like, but rest assured that Lily was a different kind of wonderful mother.""


 


Harry looked like he might argue, and Hermione was certain she couldn't bear any more of that. Besides, there was something else, a couple of somethings.


 


""You said Molly was worried about Ron?"" Hermione enquired hesitantly. She wasn't sure if she wanted to know. But she still cared about him. He was an important part of her past even if they couldn't push through to even friendship in the future. 


 


Andromeda closed her eyes and took a deep breath. ""It seems the entire attack's purpose was to put a curse on Ron. We don't... no one is sure quite what it is. Severus was able to shine some light on part of it, but new twists have been added and neither he nor Madam Pomfrey can tell if they serve a deeper purpose. Severus is working on a cure, but it will be slow going when he doesn't know all of the things that make this curse different.""


 


""What is wrong with him?"" she heard herself ask.


 


""It is a debilitating curse for the arms and legs. He has no ability to move them any longer. That's the part Severus was already familiar with. However, he is also blind and sometimes deaf. We don't know how or why.""


 


Hermione felt tears sliding down her cheeks as she wondered how those horrible things could possibly have happened to 

Ron,

 their friend, their confidant. They had been through so much together, and now he was... Merlin, he must be so scared and angry. Hermione's eyes met Harry's and she knew he was thinking the same things. 


 


Trying to tuck away the fear and heartache she was feeling, Hermione snuggled the baby in her arms, taking comfort in his presence, and began trying to think through things. ""All of the fireplaces everywhere need to be blocked,"" she began. ""Harry, could you start a list?""


 


He nodded at her, tears streaking down his cheeks, as he gathered parchment and one of her quills. He sat down at the table nearest her and earnestly began writing her suggestion. Before falling asleep, Andromeda agreed that they would need to use her Scrying Wall when she woke, to talk to those at the castle. When that happened, Hermione intended to be armed with a plan.


Trigger Warning: Discussion of sexual assault in second segment (Death Eaters bragging about things they want to do)

I'm excited about this chapter! I can't wait to hear what you all think!

Another thing I'm excited about: This was my first ever fanfiction. I started it just over a year ago (September 5th). Since then, I've gone crazy with my writing and been churning out lots of content - not always the best, but I have fun with it. This chapter will push my posted word total over 500k! Is that not the craziest thing? 

My alpha, Omnenomnom, keeps me on track. My other alpha, StarGirlPotter, helps me with my wild ideas. And I greatly appreciate my beta as well, highlyintelligentblonde. Thank you all!

I still don't own Harry Potter.


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            


Thursday, June 11th, early afternoon


 


Hermione pursed her lips as she watched some of the recruits slide the last bricks in place to close off the library floo. There were several others throughout the Manor, of course, but with teams working all over the house, they would undoubtedly all be done soon. All the floos across all the safehouses and Hogwarts itself were being blocked today. 


 


It was supposed to make them all feel safer. Hermione knew it 

was

 safer this way. But somehow it still felt suffocating and scary. There were moments when she could scarcely catch her breath. Part of her wanted to go outside where she couldn't see. But the sweltering heat did nothing to make her feel less trapped. So she was inside, under cooling charms, trying to focus on the Protean-based communication devices she was working on, and wishing she could escape the oppressive feeling that threatened her.


 


Teddy seemed to agree. He had been fussing in Andromeda's arms all day. They had both been awake in the wee hours of the morning when Hermione frantically told her what Draco had told her. They hadn't slept in all that time. The few times Andromeda had tried to put him down, the tiny boy had been inconsolable. Hermione had tried to take a turn with him, as had Harry and Theo, but he wouldn't allow anyone but Andromeda to hold him without wailing. 


 


Andromeda was walking back and forth to soothe him when she finally seemed to reach her breaking point. She called out, ""Lorry!"" 


 


The little elf that appeared was tidy and held herself straight. She seemed pleased to be called upon. ""How may I help you, mistress?"" she spoke. Hermione blinked in surprise, having never heard such a well-spoken house elf. 


 


""Are you feeling any more up to tending my grandson than you were before?"" Andromeda asked. Her words were not spoken harshly, despite how tired and worn she seemed. She hadn't really recovered from everything yet and Teddy's mood wasn't helping.


 


""No, mistress. Lorry apologizes, but I am no better at tending children than I was when  Nymphadora was the young one."" The elf's cheeks had tinged pink, but she spoke confidently and didn't try to hurt herself.


 


For a single moment, Andromeda looked ready to collapse. Hermione started to move forward on instinct before the older woman sank into a seat and asked, ""Are there any elves at Hogwarts who would be willing-""


 


""Mimsy, Mistress. Mimsy loves little Teddy. And there is none better for raising little wizards.""


 


Hermione felt her breath constricting. Mimsy. She couldn't trust that elf! How could she let Andromeda entrust her with Teddy? But then her logic came streaming in. Mimsy had saved him, and Molly, too, as best she could, from the Death Eaters during the attack. The little elf had always seemed to care - about her, and certainly about the new Young Master growing inside her.


 


As much as she wanted to protest, one look at Andromeda and she couldn't imagine saying no to an elf who could offer relief. Hermione caught the end of what she had been saying. ""... ask her if she would be willing, if we can negotiate it with Hogwarts, for her to come-""


 


Mind made up, Hermione sighed and said, ""Mimsy."" 


 


The elf appeared beside her, much to Andromeda's shock if the look she was giving Hermione was any indication. 


 


""Mistress Hermione!?"" Mimsy squeaked. ""Yous called for Mimsy?""


 


There was such hope in the elf's voice and the look in her eyes that Hermione felt guilty for a moment before remembering the elf's betrayal. But... she knew more now. She wasn't sure how Malfoy had managed to both give her his elf and retain enough control over her to keep Mimsy from telling Hermione the secrets she held, but ultimately he had. Perhaps some of it was Mimsy's own stubbornness, too, but it didn't matter. Hermione understood the whys now, knew that 'Master' could be trusted, and that Mimsy had bravely defended Molly and Teddy against the Death Eaters. It was time.


 


""I did, Mimsy. I appreciate your service to Molly Weasley and baby Teddy-""


 


""Mimsy takes care of the babies. Yes she does. Mimsy takes care of Teddy now?"" she asked. She looked hopeful.


 


It wasn't where Hermione had intended to begin, but it was the purpose of bringing her here. ""Yes-""


 


""Thank you, Mistress Hermione!"" She turned and bounded over to Andromeda, pulling Teddy into her arms where he immediately giggled and snuggled into her.


 


""Wait, Mimsy!"" Hermione said, trying to keep the frustrated amusement from her tone. ""I wasn't done speaking to you.""


 


""Oh? Mistress Hermione wants to speak to old Mimsy?"" she questioned. Hermione could hear the unspoken censure for having shut her out.


 


""Yes, Mimsy, I do. I'm not apologizing for sending you away when you had proven untrustworthy to me."" That much was certain. She saw Andromeda's eyes widen. It took Hermione a moment to gather the rest of what she needed to say. ""I know who Master is now. I know I am married to Draco Malfoy. I suppose that makes me Hermione Malfoy."" She only choked on her own name a little bit.


 


The wizened elf beamed. ""Is hims here, Mistress Hermione Malfoy?""


 


""Just Mistress Hermione, thank you. And no, he is not. But we-""


 


""MIMSY?"" an incredulous voice spoke from the door.


 


""Mister Theo!"" Still careful of Teddy in her arms, Mimsy was across the room in no time, flinging her tiny body against the young man standing there in shock.


 


""Mimsy - what? How? Is Draco here?"" Theo asked, each question slightly more excited than the last.


 


""No, Mister Theo. Mimsy has been being at the castle. But Mistress Hermione calls me back now. I gets to be taking care of Teddy.""


 


Theo's expression had fallen to discover that Draco wasn't with her, but he smiled at her now. ""I'm glad, Mimsy. You'll take the best care of him.""


 


""I take it you know this elf?"" Andromeda asked. She was stating the obvious, but Hermione was as curious as she was to hear more.


 


""You could say that,"" Theo said with a smile. ""She practically raised me, especially after my Mum passed and I spent as much time as I could at Draco's.""


 


Teddy began to fuss a bit again and Mimsy shushed him. ""Mimsy be taking Young Teddy to hims bed."" She walked off down the hall toward his room, though Hermione had no idea how she would know where it was.


 


""They know the layout of any manor, or regular house, I suppose, that they're called to. It's part of their magic,"" Andromeda explained without being asked. Hermione was glad for it but she felt her cheeks tinge a little pink at being caught so unaware of a fact that must be basic to them.


 


""I can't believe she's here..."" Theo trailed off, still staring at the spot where she had walked away. ""How... why was she at the castle?"" 


 


Hermione wondered how he was going to react to this story, but there was no real reason not to share it. ""Mimsy was with me when I woke, having just been obliviated, my last memories of battle. She helped me escape. We were in Paris. She told me Zabini had obliviated me and left me there, but I'm not sure..."" The more Hermione had thought about it, the less sense that made. But any deception around those moments had probably just been Malfoy's orders to protect Mimsy. She wasn't sure what to make of his care for the elf.


 


""She must have been terrified,"" Theo commented. ""Mimsy was always nervous when they were at the Paris property. I never understood why, but something about the city scared her. She wouldn't ever let us go explore like she would in other cities.""


 


That was something she hadn't known. Mimsy never let on. Not that they stayed in Paris very long, but it was still disconcerting to discover from someone else that the poor thing may have been frightened. She had seemed so in control and certain at the time. 


 


""I never wanted to own a house elf."" She heard Theo snickering and muttering SPEW. ""But she refused to be freed, so I kept her with me. When we were finally found, she came with me. But then I found out the bond was a marriage bond and... the pregnancy. I don't think she meant to reveal that she knew about it all along. But she did. She had 

known.

 When Draco didn't - doesn't - know, she did and she hadn't said a word. I... now that I know more, I understand, but... it was a huge betrayal, Theo. I trusted her.""


 


""So you sent her away?"" His tone was angrier than she could ever recall Theo sounding before and Hermione felt herself responding before she thought better of it.


 


""Yes! I sent away the house elf I didn't want in the first place who claimed I was her Mistress but continued to keep secrets for her previous Master who she said she no longer belonged to at all!"" she defended.


 


""Well it... how... that shouldn't have been possible."" Theo seemed completely confused, looking to Andromeda for help. 


 


""I don't know either, child,"" Andromeda responded to his unspoken plea, ""but my guess would be that ownership was able to change that way because of this bond between them. And that his previous commands could still override Hermione's because, despite giving her the elf, he's still technically part of her magic.""


 


""Part of 

my

 magic?"" Hermione heard herself say. Malfoy absolutely was not that. 


 


""Yes. Hermione, I know that isn't something you want to hear, but... a goblin blood ritual ties your magic together in ways that can't be undone. It ties your 

magic

 together. The most puzzling part, honestly, is that he's not draining your magic all the time.""


 


Hermione tilted her head to the side, thinking. ""He hasn't ever done that. There have been times when I feel... almost a little tug from the thread and I know he needs help. So I can send him my magic, but he has never taken it.""


 


Andromeda looked troubled, but she nodded slowly. ""Perhaps the boy is a better person than we have ever had reason to give him credit for.""


 


For a moment, Hermione considered saying something disparaging about him, but there wasn't really a reason. And as annoying as her no-nonsense care had been, Hermione respected Andromeda. She didn't want the woman to think less of her. She was just thinking of something neutral to say when Andromeda changed the subject.


 


""Was there something you came in here for, Theo?"" she asked.


 


""Oh! Right. I had a thought I wanted to discuss with Hermione, about the ward rituals,"" he explained, hastily pulling some parchment from his pocket. ""I just jotted this down when it came to me. So it's not very organized yet.""


 


Theo pulled out a chair at the library table and spread the parchment out before him. Hermione leaned over to see, reading aloud as Andromeda made her way toward them, ""Flounder Room Temp? Are we cooking? Required Secrets. Did you mean secret ingredients? I don't think leaving fish at room temperature is a good-""


 


An irritable grumble told her Theo was not amused, but she really couldn't tell what he was getting at. His handwriting was just atrocious.


 


""I told you I was just jotting things down. It says Founders Rooms. Temp for temporary is on a different line. And that part is for the Room of Requirements and the Chamber of Secrets.""


 


""Oh,"" Hermione could see it now. ""What do you mean by Founders' rooms? We know Salazar Slytherin created the Chamber of Secrets, of course, but the Room of Requirement isn't like that.""


 


""Isn't it?"" Theo asked. ""It's always there, but can only be found temporarily, when there is need.""


 


""That's true,"" she agreed, ""But the Chamber exists whether there is need or not.""


 


""It seems that way to you. And it's true that it doesn't change the way the Room of Requirement does, but I think that might be more because Slytherin's goals were more singular. House a giant monster to murder muggleborn schoolchildren. Simple. It's entrance, however, is only available under the right conditions.""


 


""I can see the similarities. It's more theoretical than literal,"" Andromeda said, the last part probably for Hermione's benefit as it looked like she was about to protest.


 


""Yes,"" Theo agreed, scribbling out something else Hermione couldn't read. 


 


""Your handwriting is usually much more legible than this,"" she complained. 


 


""It's always shite when I'm excited. Fingers can't keep up,"" he replied absently. His quill was still flying over the parchment, making something of a map.


 


Looking at it, she suddenly realized what he was getting at. ""You think they each made a room? Just for their heirs? And... in the corners like that, up and down. Merlin, if that's true it changes a few things with this first ritual, too.""


 


""Yes, but I think we can make the changes easily. It's a simple matter of who is paired and which parts of the castle we send them to,"" Theo agreed.


 


Andromeda sounded exasperated when she asked, ""Are you going to explain all this or should I go take a nap instead?""


 


Hermione's eyes met Theo's and they both smiled. ""Nap,"" they said in unison.


 


At Andromeda's stunned look, they both began to laugh and Hermione said, ""Just for now. You truly need it while Mimsy is tending Teddy. You haven't had much sleep lately. We'll explain it all once we have it worked out ourselves.""


 


The older woman huffed, but dropped a thankful hand on Hermione's shoulder before heading out of the room grumbling to herself. Hermione and Theo exchanged an amused look before diving back in.


 


""So who do you think created the Room of Requirement?"" Hermione asked.


 


""Hufflepuff,"" Theo said with complete confidence.


 


""What? How can you be so sure?"" she balked.


 


""Well it's there for everyone, right? Whatever they need. And loyal to whoever is in the room at the time."" Theo stated his case, ticking off the points on his long, elegant fingers. ""Helga Hufflepuff would have considered every student of Hogwarts an heir of her own.""


 


Hermione considered those points for a moment. ""I was thinking it might be Godric's since it's the only place you could train for battle.""


 


""Are we sure of that?"" Theo asked. ""Whoever made the Room of Requirement, we're still missing two others. Perhaps one is a giant arena.""


 


She rolled her eyes. ""How could something that large be hidden inside the castle if not in a room that changes?"" she scoffed. 


 


Theo raised an eyebrow, then wiggled his fingers at her. ""Maaaaagic.""


 


Without missing a beat, Hermione accioed a pillow to hit him with. It turned into a scuffle for a moment, until they were both out of breath from laughing. 


 


""Seriously,"" Theo finally said. ""I think we're probably looking for rooms that belong to Ravenclaw and Gryffindor.""


 


""I should think Ravenclaw's would have to be some sort of study,"" Hermione said, excitement rushing in her veins.


 


""Or a library,"" Theo said with a smirk. She could tell he wasn't surprised when she was practically dancing at the thought. Thinking aloud, he continued, ""Gryffindor's could be an arena as you mentioned-""


 


""I was only joking!""


 


""Fine, an armoury, then. Or... some sort of room for doing daredevil things?"" Theo suggested mischievously.


 


She hit him with the pillow again and he was laughing too hard then to keep guessing. Hermione sobered suddenly, a new thought crossing her mind. ""Oh Merlin,"" she whispered and snatched over one of the books they had previously been using for their research. 


 


""What have you thought of?"" he asked, his mood coming down as he waited for her to explain. Despite his question, he waited patiently for her to answer. Hermione loved that he was a good enough research partner to know when something new needed to be checked before discussing.


 


She was flipping carefully through an old journal that had once belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw when she found the passage. Biting her lip, Hermione confirmed what she had feared. ""Listen to this,"" she said, voice trembling as she started to read. 

""We built the castle's mind from inside our own, starting in our rooms,

 - of course I didn't see it when I read this before, but she must have meant their special rooms, the ones just for their heirs -

 with the blood that was needed.""



 


""How much blood? Why do they never think these things are important?"" Theo groaned.


 


""I don't know,"" she whispered, trying not to panic. ""And even if we 

did

 know how much they used, it would likely be different now. The castle's 'mind' as she calls it is far more advanced. The castle itself is bigger. There would need to be more-""


 


Theo caught her hands and pulled the journal away from her as he said, ""Those aren't things we have to worry about yet.""


 


""How much blood do you think that kind of ritual will require, Theo? And no one will agree to a blood ritual anyway,"" Hermione worried.


 


""They will. They have to. Hogwarts will fall without these ancient wards, and the wizarding world will crumble. Now,"" Theo was breathing heavily, clearly struggling to calm himself, ""what we have to focus on at this moment is tweaking the spell for selecting the participants in tomorrow's ritual.""


 


""What should we do differently? We're already seeking the best candidate from each house. What could we- No. Theo, no. We can't bring blood into this, too,"" Hermione denied.


 


""The people chosen now will connect better for the current ritual if their blood is attuned to the Founders. If any of them actually have the blood of a Founder, however small, it will make the whole thing more powerful. And it could make all the difference later, when these same people participate - along with others - in the larger ritual,"" Theo reasoned.


 


She couldn't deny it, much as she wanted to. Hermione sighed, and nodded. The two of them pulled a few more books and parchments closer and bent over the table, making the necessary adjustments and hoping the Order members would allow it.


 


*********************


 


""Bart!"" someone shouted near his ear. Charlie jumped and dropped the book he had been reading. He growled at the fellow, thankful that it was in character for Bart to do so. 


 


""What the bloody hell you reading that's so all fired interesting? Dinner bell's ringing.""


 


Going through the mental battle of what he wanted to say versus what Bart would say, Charlie let the silence get awkward before choosing, ""Not hungry enough to put down my book yet.""


 


""I know you're used to your little pureblood pampering, but here they won't feed you if you don't go at the right time. Get your arse to the mess hall,"" Daniel told him irritably. Charlie knew the man should still have been in the infirmary even today, so his mood was more than understandable. 


 


Grumbling, Charlie pulled himself up off the bed and stomped out ahead of his one ""friend"" amongst the training guards. He was really quite thankful. Charlie had been thoroughly engrossed in his book and wouldn't have made it to dinner without the nudge from Daniel. He was thankful, too, that this was quite normal behavior for Bart.


 


Charlie was planning something crazy. Crazier than just joining the Dark Lord's ranks. More dangerous, too, considering how vulnerable he would be at times in the process. But what wasn't crazy and dangerous in his life these days? 


 


The book he had been reading contained all the instructions to become an animagus. Once he and Draco had made their secret room, he had been able to relax enough to work on the meditations. He still wasn't sure yet what his form would be, but he was getting closer. He had begun looking around for a place to gather dew that was neither touched by sunlight nor human feet back when he was scouting out the recruits and choosing Bart. He already had a mandrake leaf, just waiting for the full moon on the 24th. Blaise could get him the other potions ingredients, or Draco, if Blaise refused. 


 


Thinking about the man he had left behind made Charlie's heart hurt. He had discovered in the brief time he had spent with the other recruits that, while they had a lot of freedom when there was downtime, there wasn't much of it. So he would be able to visit Blaise, Draco too, but not as frequently as he wanted. He already fiercely missed them both. Of course, he could always find a reason to need the infirmary. Bart was about to get a reputation as a terrible clutz.


 


Gathering food onto a plate, he made sure to act the part of a proper low-level pureblood, disgusted by the common folk around him. It was a bit like pretending to be Percy, though that thought made his heart hurt, too. He couldn't think about the rest of the family, not while he had to be focused here. He would see them all again. But he was helping everyone out first.


 


That was why it was so important to become an animagus, after all. He was taking so many risks right now. At any moment, someone could figure out who ""Bart"" really was. He hoped it wasn't for a long time. Charlie had a lot he wanted to accomplish first. But someday, someone would. At the very least, they would catch on that he wasn't actually on the Death Eaters' side. When that day came, he needed every tool possible to get himself, Tonks, Blaise, Draco, and every single person who was a victim here, out.


 


Charlie tried to shake himself out of his thoughts. No matter how much he wanted to worry over things and make plans for how to handle all of this, that wasn't his job right now. What he had to focus on right now was what was going on around him. 


 


Bart's disinterest in other people had been part of why Charlie had chosen him in the first place, making him an outcast and considerably easier to pass as him. But he, Charlie, needed to learn enough about his new mates to know who and what he could work with, so Bart was about to become a little more friendly. 


 


Daniel was looking at him from across the room. He had sat down with his hometown mates, and was waving at him as though he wanted Bart to join them. Perhaps that was the best place to start.


 


""Look at that,"" a blond-haired bloke said. ""His Lordship come down to sit with the little folk.""


 


Charlie put his napkin in his lap and cleared his throat. ""I thought the commoners might appreciate my benevolence,"" he said, quiet and dry. It was the way Bart always spoke, but Charlie liked to think it was a bit wittier than the man would have come up with on his own. And might be funny enough to start, slowly, allowing Bart to join the group.


 


There was laughter around him and someone clapped him hard on the back. The force of it on this very different body surprised him, knocking him forward so that the spoon of potatoes he had in his hand was now on his face and all over the very necessary glasses Bart wore. 


 


He began cursing in a most un-Bart-ly way, but no one heard him over all the laughter. The man who had hit his back was laughing hardest, a giant fellow with long, scraggly brown hair. ""Best eat up, Bartleby. You'll be losing rank if a mudblood taps your back and you fall right over like that.""


 


More laughter. He could feel his cheeks burning. But following the script he had created for Bart in his head, Charlie opted to ignore. The conversation, at the mention of mudbloods, had turned from him anyway.


 


""I'll be making the mudbloods fall on themselves, not the other way around!"" the blond man said. ""Get'em down where they belong, then I'll make the animals pay for trying to steal our magic.""


 


Charlie felt his insides turn to lead. The men around him all guffawed. Another brown-haired man, this one with sharp green eyes, said, ""I think they should pay with their legs spread. Muggle ones, too. Teach them to birth abominations.""


 


""Can't wait til we move up. Just another couple of ranks and we can start having our way with them on the raids,"" Daniel said excitedly.


 


""I'm looking forward to the 

crucios

 myself,"" a prim feminine voice at the next table weighed in. Charlie tried to keep himself from startling. He hadn't realized there were women here. That table had several though, all far too young to be caught up in this mess, he thought. ""Especially since those monsters at the castle took Story and Maggie. Until I can get my hands on a blood traitor, mudbloods and the creatures they come from will have to do.""


 


Ice filled his system as Charlie struggled to continue eating as though this were all normal. There was a moment of quiet before a gruff voice across from him replied to the girl, ""Less they ran off to them. Not so sure those two weren't blood traitors themselves.""


 


""How dare you!"" the original girl started, voice rising.


 


Another girl leaned over, ""Tracy, forget him! We know them and we know he's wrong.""


 


The man laughed and several others joined him. The girls went back to their own conversations as the men continued to boast about the horrific things they would do to any muggles or muggleborns they could get their hands on. Charlie struggled to continue forcing himself to eat, acting like everything was normal. Merlin, he wanted his own body back so he could beat the shite out of these arseholes. With that reminder, he took a swig from his flask, working not to shudder at the disgusting potion. 


 


He had known he would have to face these things. This first day of training had been brutal for him just in the sense of all the blood traitor and mudblood talk as they dueled and trained. But somehow Charlie hadn't counted on the people he was surrounded with being actively horrible during everyday conversations. He would have to stay a loner if this was how all the recruits behaved. And they probably did, he realized with a sinking heart. They wouldn't be here otherwise. 


 


Thicker skin would be necessary, but he could do that. Merlin, he had convinced Bellatrix to trust him. He worked with dragons. He could handle living with a crowd of Death Eater hopefuls, no matter how much it turned his stomach to listen to them.


 


He left as soon as he could choke down enough food to be believable. He had to get away. And honestly, he wanted to get back and meditate, not even on his animagus form, just work on clearing his mind before trying to sleep. Perhaps a book on mind magic, occluding specifically, would not be amiss. As Charlie entered the empty bunkroom, he heaved a sigh of relief. Being alone, even for just a few minutes, was like a balm to his soul. He lay down on the bed and closed his eyes, letting all the tension of his first full day on the dark side melt away. He could do this. He would. But he would treasure the quiet moments to himself.


 


**************


 


She rushed into the center of the Rose Garden as soon as she arrived. Hermione's feet couldn't carry her fast enough. Frustration almost overwhelmed her when she found the clearing empty. She was throwing stones into the fountain when she finally heard movement behind her and spun. 


 


Malfoy was coming out of his entrance, looking pleased about something. Hermione was aware that she should greet him, exchange some pleasantries before asking her questions, but she couldn't stand it.


 


""What did they curse Ron with?"" she asked urgently.


 


""The Weasel?"" Malfoy sneered, stopping in his tracks.


 


Hermione sighed. She didn't understand how he could go from being somewhat decent last time to such an insensitive childish arsehole. Though, now that she thought about it, she didn't have the best feelings toward Ron either. 


 


""Yes, the Weasel. He was hit with something Dolohov created.""


 


""Shite,"" Malfoy said, running his hand through his hair. 


 


When he didn't respond otherwise, she said, ""You're still planning to give me information?"" He nodded, but then she told him, ""Snape said-""


 


Malfoy went white. ""How dare you?"" he hissed. ""What the bloody hell could Severus have said that would be relevant now?""


 


Hermione blinked a few times, trying to figure out why he was so upset. Oh, Merlin. ""You were... close?""


 


""He was my godfather. And a hell of a better father figure than the one I ended up with.""


 


She bit her lip. Did she tell him? Something inside her wanted to ease the pain she could see on his face. But he had also said not to tell him anything. If he didn't know that Snape was alive and she told him, that was a huge secret to have to hold back from Voldy. 


 


""Okay,"" she said slowly.


 


Malfoy stared at her for a moment. She could see hope flaring in his eyes, his normally guarded look dropping. ""Do you know something? Is... did he make it?""


 


Her mouth dropped open. ""I... how can you ask me that?"" she questioned. She had no idea what else to say. Maybe that would give him enough of an answer to feel hopeful but not enough to accidentally reveal what he shouldn't know. 


 


His expression closed. ""Of course,"" he sneered as though he wasn't the one who had told her not to tell him things. ""For security. Fine. So you need information about this curse? What are his symptoms?""


 


As she explained to him everything she knew, Malfoy started breathing rather heavily as though he were panicking. Finally he held up a hand. ""Stop! That's enough. I know... I can consult with Blaise for how to fight it, but... I know enough to help.""


 


""Oh thank Merlin! We need him cured-""


 


""I doubt you can cure him. I don't know a countercurse if there even is one,"" he snapped. ""But I know something you clearly don't. The blindness, and probably the deafness, too. They're tools. Whoever cast it can see through his eyes, hear what's happening around him. He needs to be completely isolated, or at the very least, kept far away from any planning they're doing.""


 


Hermione felt her heart stop. ""Are you serious?"" 


 


""What reason do I have to lie exactly?""


 


""I... I need to get out of here,"" Hermione cried, starting toward her pathway out. 


 


She was halted by a strong, hot hand on her arm jerking her back. ""Wait!"" he barked. ""Wait, please."" Something about his tone when he said 'please' made Hermione pause.


 


""What?"" she asked, unable to keep the impatience out of her tone. 


 


""Would that even work? Can you just walk out of here and be awake?"" he asked.


 


She huffed. ""No, probably not. But I don't know how to beat on the walls here and demand to be let out.""


 


Malfoy smirked at the image she had created, then his look became serious again. His silver eyes were so close. ""I need you to know I'll try, Granger. I know you lot will be trying to figure something out, but I'll work on it here, too. We're... Zabini is the Healer, of course, but I'm his apprentice now, and we'll-""


 


""I thought you were in a coma?"" she asked, suspicion making her blood run cold. Was he lying to her already?


 


""I am. Well, I'm not. Fuck. We're using polyjuice and having someone we're pretending is me and I'm polyjuiced as the Healer's apprentice and... it all sounds rather stupid to explain, but it's necessary...""


 


Hermione had never heard Malfoy ramble quite like this. Mixed with how earnest he had been moments before, how important it had seemed to him for her to know he was going to do what he could, she found it... appealing. And he hadn't dropped her arm yet. Before she realized what she was doing, she reached a hand out and placed it on his chest, above his heart where she knew the black spot was. 


 


His eyes rounded and his breathing turned harsh. ""What are you doing?"" he asked.


 


""I don't know. It just felt... feels right,"" she told him honestly. The hand that had been holding her arm suddenly dropped, brushing her hand on its way down. Hermione felt sparks between them where they had touched. 


 


She thought she was just bringing her hand up to inspect it after that odd feeling, but it moved of its own will. They were both surprised when she cupped his cheek, her lower palm resting on his jaw. Malfoy's breathing was rapid now. So was her own.


 


When they came together, Hermione had no idea who had initiated the kiss. Only that a single touch ignited a fire down low inside her and their lips seemed made to fit together. She had never been kissed so thoroughly, though they never moved beyond the press of their lips. The magic flowing between them made it so much more intimate, though. Or maybe, somehow, it was just the two of them. As they pulled back just enough for her to tuck her head under his chin, burying herself in his neck and his scent, he exhaled hard. She could feel his heart hammering where her hand still rested. 


 


Hermione pulled away suddenly. ""It's time for me to go now,"" she said. Somehow she knew she was waking. She reached up and kissed his cheek, but it set his heart racing even harder.


 


""I'll do everything I can,"" he said, voice hoarse and low.


 


""Thank you. Be safe."" She disappeared from the clearing as her eyes popped open in the real world and she popped out of bed to find Andromeda.


 

Are you excited about the upcoming ritual? Any guesses as to what will happen with it? And things that might happen while they're at Hogwarts? 

What do you think Charlie's animagus form should be?

Like that taste of Dramione?

I'm so excited to be posting this chapter, and for the arc it's starting! Buckle up, folks. 

Thank you to omnenomnom, my forever alpha. And an apology to highlyintelligentblonde, my beta whom I just realized I never sent this one to. Sorry!

I'm too excited to write anything else, so here you go! Let me know what you think!


Saturday, June 13th


 


""Who are you? Where is Zabini?"" the woman hissed.


 


Draco held up his hands in surrender. She looked like she might attack him and from everything he'd heard, his cousin was quite proficient at attacking. Of course, she would need to do it quietly, it seemed, as she was watching the unmoving figure on the bed even as she glanced back at Draco for an answer. 


 


""I'm the Healer's apprentice. Healer Zabini sent me to bring your potions. And something Mr. Rowle ordered."" 


 


He pulled a selection of potions from his robes. ""You'll want to take this one first,"" he said, voice almost silent as he slipped her the contraception potion.


 


Eyes widening, Tonks gulped it quickly down and handed the vial back so that Draco could pocket it. 


 


""These are for your pain,"" he said a little louder, handing her the potions Blaise had sent, knowing what shape she was likely to be in. He was right, of course. She looked like she had been beaten both recently and at some point closer to Blaise's last visit.


 


""Who are you?"" she asked quietly, urgently. 


 


He stared at her. Draco wasn't sure how to answer when his apprentice name would mean nothing and his real name would make her distrust him. ""I'm someone Zabini trusts,"" he settled on.


 


Tonks looked exasperated, but shook her head as though to clear it. ""Why isn't he here?"" she asked.


 


""He isn't required to be, you know,"" Draco said, casting a diagnostic on her as Blaise had taught him. He was relieved to see that nothing was too bad. He just needed to bandage a few things and apply some bruise salve. Knowing he wasn't really ready to set bones or deal with major wounds, Draco was happy that he hadn't run into any of those things on his rounds yet today.


 


Tonks seemed agitated by his answer. ""I'm aware he isn't required to be,"" she snapped, ""But he usually is and I... needed to speak with him.""


 


Damn. This was a problem he and Blaise hadn't discussed. They 

knew

 Tonks was on their side and wouldn't rat them out to the Death Eaters no matter what might happen to her. Charlie vouched for her personally. She was an ally, even if she didn't know it. Whatever she had to tell Blaise was probably worth knowing, and in his new role with Hermione, he needed all the information he could get.


 


Without his permission, Draco's cheeks had turned a little red at the thought of Hermione. He blushed harder when Tonks raised an eyebrow at him, but her expression was more angry than playful. ""Busy with Zabini? I was under the impression he had a boyfriend already.""


 


""Merlin, no!"" he sputtered, loudly enough that she shushed him. ""No, he's... the man Blaise is with has nothing to worry about from me."" She obviously knew. To be sure, he added, ""You'll understand that I can't mention his name.""


 


She was staring at him like a puzzle now as he worked on cleaning up an abrasion on her cheek. Speaking so quietly he wouldn't have heard her if he weren't leaned in close, she said, ""So you know 

him

 and you're friendly enough with Zabini to call him 'Blaise.' What's your apprentice name?""


 


He told her and then she smirked at him. ""But it's not your real name, is it?""


 


""No,"" he breathed. It was a risk, but a calculated one. 


 


After a moment, she nodded. ""Cousins should stick together,"" she said, as though she were discussing the weather. Draco couldn't help but smirk back at her. 


 


""Some cousins can be quite smart, I hear.""


 


Tonks smiled back. ""They can. Now why isn't Zabini here? Will you be coming in his stead regularly?""


 


""Possibly, but today specifically he's working on a countercurse for something."" He looked meaningfully toward Rowle on the bed. Tonks' eyes went wide as she seemed to understand. 


 


""That sounds useful, if there were a way to get it through to the people who need it,"" she said carefully.


 


""It will be useful,"" Draco said, not daring to look at her. 


 


""Can you fetch me parchment and the quill from the desk over there?"" Tonks asked him. For a moment, he wasn't sure why she needed to ask him. Then he realized that without magic, she couldn't just call it to her. Not to mention the gashes he still needed to heal on her legs. So he did as she asked and then set about his task, ignoring the scratch of the quill as he worked. 


 


By the time he finished, Tonks was blowing on the piece of parchment. ""I'll be able to put this back now,"" she said in reference to the quill, but the parchment she had folded up and handed to him. Draco felt his eyebrows rise, but he took it and stuffed it deep into the pocket with the empty contraception vials.


 


""Now I must tend to Mr. Rowle,"" he told her, walking over to the bed. The man appeared to be in some sort of trance. Part of Draco wanted to say fuck the subterfuge and deal with the man by Avada-ing him on the spot. It wouldn't be his first kill, after all, and at least this one would be more meaningful. 


 


It was tempting, but he knew they wouldn't make it out alive. The Dark Lord would know instantly if one of his Inner Circle was killed. Even knowing that, Draco could feel his body tensing to do the deed. He had to stop and breathe deeply to bring himself back under control.


 


Tonks, off to one side, seemed concerned about him, but Draco couldn't very well explain to her the urge he was fighting off. He shook his head and cast his diagnostic like a good little Healer boy. Most unfortunately, the man was still in perfect health.


 


Just as Draco was turning around, Rowle sat straight up in bed, his eyes suddenly focusing hard on Draco. Of course he was polyjuiced, but there was still that moment of terror when he was sure the man knew who he was. 


 


""They're going today!"" he cried, and leapt from the bed. If Draco had thought faster, he would have found some way to stall the man. Anything Thorfinn Rowle sounded that gleeful about had to be bad for the Order or the muggles or wizarding society in general. 


 


By the time something occurred to him, the man was out of the room, leaving him standing there, staring at a frantic Tonks. She ran up to him, grabbing his upper arms and practically shaking him, despite how much taller he was than her current form. ""Shite! Your way to communicate! Can you get them a message now? Immediately?""


 


Reluctantly, Draco shook his head. ""No, Tonks. It's not that fast."" He was trying to peel her hands off of him, knowing he needed to get out of there before Rowle came back and found him still there, talking with his slave. 

That

 would be a way for the Healer's apprentice to be noticed. And not a good way at all.


 


""Fuck!"" She tugged at her hair.


 


""Why? What is it?""


 


""Some of the Order members are moving from a safe house to Hogwarts. Today, from the sound of what he just said. He's seen or heard them discussing it around Ron, so there are Death Eaters - record numbers of the bastards - waiting for them and blocking their way.""


 


Draco had a sinking feeling in his stomach as he asked, ""Who? What Order members are moving?""


 


""Harry and Hermione,"" she whispered, fear making her voice tremble.


 


***********


 


""Get your gear, recruits!"" the one Charlie thought of as Brute shouted. For the life of him, he couldn't recall that trainer's name. No one ever dared say it anyway, so he figured it didn't much matter. 


 


Scrambling along with everyone else, Charlie, or rather Bart, managed to get his mask and armband on without falling over or hurting himself or anyone else even once. Of course, grabbing a broom was another matter. He ""accidentally"" struck three of his fellows in the process of getting his broom. They would be apparating, but then flying to their final destination.


 


Charlie felt his nerves tightening. He hadn't expected a raid so soon. Of course he wasn't completely sure that's what this was. Perhaps it was some sort of advanced training. But the look on Brute's face said it was important to do well, whatever it was.


 


""We're apparating to Hogsmeade, then we'll be surrounding the area we know must contain Hogwarts.""


 


""That's a huge area!"" someone cried. Charlie was honestly glad someone had voiced the sentiment as he had just been thinking the same.


 


Brute snarled, ""And now you know why useless idiots like you lot are being called into action. We'll have targets to watch for and, under no circumstances will any of you allow those targets to get past you.""


 


""How will we identify them, sir?"" another brave soul asked.


 


""It's Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. If you don't know them on sight, you don't deserve to be here.""


 


Charlie had to take deep breaths to calm himself enough to act happy about this prospect like the others. As he looked around, he did see a couple of others who looked unhappy. A man a few years younger than himself was clearly trying to hide his grimace. Did Charlie recognize him? He looked familiar, but he wasn't sure. The other looked a little older, with curly blond hair. He was openly scowling. 


 


Trying to memorize the two as people he could seek out for connection in the mess hall, Charlie realized he had to be more focused on the apparation. 

Destination. Determination. Deliberation.

 


 


Merlin, he hated apparating when he wasn't completely certain of the exact location he was going. At least it was now normal for Bart to land poorly and stumble into his fellows in the process. 


 


He had barely righted himself when there were instructions shouted from a man in a mask. It occurred to Charlie that if the Order could get ahold of some of those masks and robes, they could cause a lot of chaos by pretending to be Death Eaters.


 


The nameless Death Eater barked their instructions, ""You wankers will head for where we think the front gate would be. The whole perimeter has to be guarded, but they'd be barmy to go there so it ought to be safe enough with you. Our intelligence says they will have very little cover, opting for 'stealth' instead. If you see Potter or the Mudblood, capture them. The Dark Lord wants to finish them himself.""


 


Charlie felt a sense of deep foreboding as he mounted his broom and joined the group in flight. But he also looked longingly toward the place he knew the castle must be. Mum and Dad and probably all of his siblings were in there. Merlin, what he wouldn't give for a round of Weasley family hugs. 


 


Closing his eyes for a moment, he put them out of his mind. Thankfully, this mission wouldn't involve going into the castle and coming face to face with any of them. He didn't think he could manage to hold his facade if that were the case. Thicker skin. He could do this.


 


Nervously, he drank from his polyjuice flask again. This would be a terrible time to be revealed. It was lucky that they were in the least likely place for action, as he couldn't think of a single way he could help Harry and Hermione without giving himself away. All he knew was that he couldn't let them get caught if they came this way.


 


***********


 


""Why does it have to be brooms?"" Hermione asked in a tone she refused to acknowledge was whining.


 


""Because Death Eaters are watching all the places we could apparate and we believe this will be a more surprising tactic,"" Andromeda said for at least the fourth time. Hermione could tell by her tone that the older woman's patience was wearing thin.


 


Harry, Theo, Goyle, and Dean all laughed. Goyle and Dean were sticking closest to them, as the most experienced fighters. The recruits would be spread out around them until the hand-off to the more experienced Order members.


 


Hermione considered arguing again. Flying in wasn't any safer than apparating where they would be watching. And no matter how many times Andromeda had assured her she had passed on the message about Ron, Hermione wanted to ask - again - if they were 

sure

 that Ron hadn't been around for any of their planning. And if they were absolutely certain that reading the parchment with the castle's information had been enough to let them through the Fidelius. And all of the other scenarios she had come up with that would ruin the plan. She sighed, knowing they would just tell her she was worrying too much. 


 


Listening to everyone else jostling one another happily and joking around, Hermione couldn't understand why she was the only one worried about this. What they were going to the castle to do was hugely important, aside from the simple fact that Harry and Hermione would have been juicy targets completely on their own. 


 


""It's time,"" Dean announced. Hermione wasn't sure when he had taken leadership of the recruits, but they followed his commands seamlessly.


 


Nervous, she waited as the front recruits took off, then those who were meant to be on their sides. She grumbled to herself as Harry, whose waist she was clinging to from behind, flung his cloak over the two of them and kicked off. Her heart hammered as the wind began tugging at her hair as they rose, even through the cloak.


 


It would have been more ideal to split them up, but she was such a terrible flyer that Harry had insisted she ride with him. They had bargained with the Invisibility Cloak, which had helped some, but there had still been objections. The protests had finally stopped when Harry suggested that putting her on a broom alone would basically be handing her back to the Death Eaters. And she had made it clear that Harry was the only person she trusted enough to ride behind. 


 


Privately, she had considered Theo, as well, but she didn't know him well enough to be sure he would fly carefully with her, so she had kept her mouth shut. He was sticking close to them. Theo might not be a coveted target on his own, but he was as essential to the ritual as she was. Harry had studied his parts as well, but Theo knew it better and was more likely to attend to all the tiny details that were necessary. Plus, he was as strong a fighter as either Dean or Goyle, so another asset to their group in the center.


 


The wind licked her skin as they reached whatever height Dean and Andromeda had decided was ideal and began moving faster. Hermione shut her eyes tight, not only uninterested in seeing how high up they were, but also the strange sight of their legs dangling beneath the Invisibility Cloak. It wasn't big enough anymore - or rather they had grown too big - to cover both of them completely. But the hope was that as long as they stayed surrounded, a few extra legs wouldn't be all that noticeable.


 


Things were eerily silent with the wind whooshing past them. There were the sounds of cloaks snapping in the wind, and every now and then a low mutter before someone shushed the speakers, but it was mostly quiet. Her pounding heart was thudding louder than the rest of it. Hermione leaned into Harry, focusing on her brother's familiar pine scent, and trying to regulate the breaths that were coming too quickly.


 


Sounds began ahead of them and she tensed. Harry patted her hand where she gripped the front of his shirt.


 


""S'okay, Hermione. It's just the exchange. Some of the recruits will stay with us for numbers, but now we've got Kingsley and some of the Aurors, plus Bill, George, Angelina, Neville, Parvati... others but those are the ones I noticed for sure.""


 


""Thanks, Harry,"" she said, and felt his hand squeeze in response. As nervous and upset as she was to be on a broom, she was thrilled to see their friends. She had missed George so much. And Neville gave her a bright smile before refocusing on the flight... if only it were under less grim circumstances. The others she wasn't as close to, but the sight of familiar faces was enough to lighten her heart. 


 


""Now hold on tight, we're going to be weaving around a bit through the forest,"" Harry warned, sending her happy heart back down through her stomach.


 


""The Forbidden Forest?"" Hermione squeaked.


 


""Yeah, Mione,"" Harry agreed. ""We can't very well go flying straight up to the front gate. Even the newest recruit would see us coming then, no matter where they have them stationed.""


 


""I thought we were expecting to sneak right past the Death Eaters since they wouldn't expect us to be flying?"" she asked, horrified at the thought. Her breaths were coming in little gasps again as they began moving under the canopy of the forest.


 


""Don't worry. It's just a precaution. If there were Death Eaters around, they would have stopped the Order from coming to meet us, right?"" Harry prompted.


 


""Right,"" she muttered, trying not to let herself think of logical reasons why that might not be true.


 


""Quiet,"" Andromeda scolded them. ""We're getting closer.""


 


Hermione was gritting her teeth and trying to ignore the swoops back and forth around trees and  over and under branches by mentally going over the ritual and all the things they would need to do before starting it when cries and crashing sounds began up ahead. She felt Harry's body tense and Hermione willed herself to open her eyes. The last thing she wanted to see was a battle or a chase on broomstick, but if either of those things were happening, she didn't want to be blind to them either. Harry might need her.


 


Gripping her wand tightly, she peeked around his shoulder to see what was happening. Andromeda, Theo, and Goyle had all tucked in tighter around them, making it even harder to see, especially as they all dodged trees and tried to stay together. But she could hear Dean yelling orders somewhere behind them, redirecting different recruits here and there. 


 


Bill and George were suddenly right next to their little party - Harry and Hermione, Andromeda, Goyle, and Theo. Quietly, Bill commanded, ""Follow us. We're splitting off from everyone else since this way is blocked.""


 


For the most part, that seemed effective. There were so many recruits between them and the Death Eaters, hardly any followed after them. But the three that did...


 


Hermione considered casting a Silencio on herself to keep from screaming as Harry's flying became increasingly wild with the Death Eaters gaining on them. George shot one cleanly off his broom with something that was nasty and green, not quite the shade of the killing curse, but close. Hermione didn't want to contemplate what that had been, but it had taken their pursuit down to two.


 


Sparks rained down on them as a spell hit the tree branch just in front of them, having barely missed Harry. How did the Death Eaters know where they were? Or was it just luck? Hermione felt too panicked to guess. She shot back at them, but gripping so tightly to Harry made it difficult to aim properly. Her spell glanced off of a tree as well, though it did seem to make the Death Eater slow down somewhat.


 


Turning to the front, Hermione was distressed to see something white and thick gathering between the giant trees of the forest around them. Something was moving in and around it when she suddenly realized... those were webs.


 


""Aragog's Children,"" Harry whispered, seemingly to himself, though she heard. It took a moment for the words to mean anything to her. Remembering Harry and Ron's story about the acromantulas, she gasped and clutched her wand tighter, reciting 

Arania Exumai

 over and over in her head as she scanned below them. 


 


Hermione could see that, though flying fast, Bill and George were being tremendously careful about the path they took, Harry and Andromeda following along with seeming ease. Goyle, however, made a wrong turn, headed straight into a web, but Theo grabbed his broom and hauled him backward, the two of them laying low to try and catch up. 


 


She was almost certain that hadn't been a purposeful maneuver, but it still worked to send one of the Death Eaters into the web, something that a loudly clicking spider seemed grateful for. The last, though. His mask was one of the unique ones, marking him as an Inner Circle member. He was gaining on Theo and Goyle at the back and Hermione couldn't hold back a little shriek when one of his spells nearly caught Theo. 


 


It made Harry look back. She saw the dread in his eyes and for a split second he looked to her in question. But there was no other answer. Even with how terrified she was; they weren't going to leave him behind. Hermione was almost thankful that the rushing wind took her breath away and made it impossible to shriek. Harry jerked to the right in a tight turn that gave her whiplash before rocketing back towards the boys. She gripped her wand and prepared for a fight, even while holding back a scream. 


 


There were trees - nothing but webs and trees - flying by as they sped forward, the wind drawing tears to her eyes. Still she didn't close them, scanning the area. They couldn't be that far. Suddenly Harry slowed, his eyes going hard. As they got closer, she could hear why. The Death Eater was speaking, taunting really.


 


""Worthless little coward! I should have drowned you after I killed your worthless mother!""


 


It was Goyle trying to pull Theo away by the broomstick now as he had a rather large gash across his forehead and cheek. Theo was pale and looked like he might pass out at any moment. The Death Eater remained floating, uninjured but with his wand trained lazily on Theo. He shot off a hex that splashed against Theo and Hermione's heart jumped in her throat.


 


Theo's pained cry and the slash of blood on his shirt was such a relief. It was just a cutting curse. Even if the wound was deep, they could heal it. The Death Eater was just toying with him.


 


She saw Theo raise a trembling hand, pointing his wand straight at the Death Eater that could only be his father. ""Avada-"" he began, but something that was a sickly yellow-brown color hit him in the shoulder, knocking him completely from the broom. 


 


""Don't be even more pathetic than you already are, boy.""


 


Hermione's heart stopped, her stomach flipping in horror as she watched him fall. She hadn't known until that moment how much of a friend Theo had become. Now he looked like a broken rag doll crashing along branches toward the forest floor.


 


Harry went into a dive without a second thought. Hermione snatched hold of the invisibility cloak so it wouldn't fly off as they swooped under Theo and caught him midair. His father was laughing like a hyena when Goyle knocked him physically off his broom by ramming straight into the man. As their brooms collided, Goyle went spiralling off to the side, but the Death Eater hit the ground hard. 


 


Not hard enough, unfortunately, since he got back up, but Hermione was happy to see they were still in the acromantula's territory and the skittering of many legs suggested Theo's father was soon to be a welcome treat.


 


Bill suddenly appeared beside them, more furious than Hermione had ever seen him. She squeaked as his strong arms were suddenly around her waist, yanking her unceremoniously onto the front of his broom. ""Merlin's fucking left tit, Harry! You just took ten years of my life going back TOWARD the Death Eaters. We don't go TOWARD the Death Eaters, Harry!""


 


""He would've died!"" Harry yelled back as they flew, cradling Theo's seemingly lifeless body to his chest.


 


""Is he alive now?"" Bill bit back angrily. ""Isn't he the Death Eater kid anyway?""


 


""Both of you, be quiet!"" Hermione hissed at them, voice shaking with emotion at the state Theo was in, the fear of an unexpected mid-air transfer, the possibility of more Death Eaters hearing them, not to mention the wild chase itself. ""And his name is Theo, Bill. He is our friend and absolutely essential to this bloody ritual so let's hope he's alive, shall we?""


 


""He's breathing,"" Harry said, ""but we need to get him to Madam Pomfrey now!""


 


""Where did Goyle go?"" Hermione asked, gulping back her terror and focusing around them in the forest. 


 


""I don't know. He was in the air after the attack, but I didn't see which way he went,"" Harry said. ""We don't have time to find him. We can only hope he made it.""


 


Bill nodded. ""We should be clear from here. George took Andromeda one way. Hopefully Goyle followed them or will catch up with us in time if he's still out here. We're going in a little closer to the front gates.""


 


""What?"" Hermione asked. ""Isn't that a terribly obvious-""


 


""It's the absolute last way they'll think we're coming in since they were waiting for us in the woods,"" Harry agreed.


 


Hermione had misgivings, but obviously she had no say in what happened, so she did her best to make herself feel secure against Bill and hope they were right. 


 


She wished she were surprised when they came to the edge of the trees and found a line of Death Eaters on the ground between themselves and Hogwarts. They all had brooms in hand, but no one was in the air at the moment. Hermione was at least relieved that she could see beyond the line. Reading the location had indeed lifted the Fidelius for her. 


 


""Fuck,"" Bill swore. 


 


""They just surrounded the entire perimeter,"" Hermione observed, fear gripping her lungs for a moment before she shoved it aside. They needed her to be thinking right now. She scanned the crowd in front of them before continuing. ""I think you were right that this was the place they least expected us to come. These are all low level guards.""


 


""How do you know that?"" Bill asked, his voice suddenly suspicious.


 


""Because I have eyes,"" she huffed. ""Their cloaks are identical and even from back here I can tell they're cheaply made. All their masks match, and they look like they're made of cloth rather than the fancy metal ones the Inner Circle members wear. That one just tripped on air. These clearly aren't top tier warriors.""


 


There were a few beats of silence before Harry grinned and dryly said, ""Well we know we still have our Hermione with us.""


 


Bill barked out a quiet laugh, but shook his head as they looked at the mess in front of them. ""I don't know how we're going to do this.""


 


""We're going to fly through them,"" Harry declared. There was steel in his voice.


 


Bill's frustration was palpable when he said, ""You can't fly through them, Harry. There are too many.""


 


Harry didn't reply, but Hermione knew what that look meant. They needed a plan 

fast

 if he was going to make it. Her hands twisted the fabric she was still hanging on to. As she looked down at the Invisibility Cloak, the plan formed in her head. As usual, it was insane and unlikely to work, but it would have to. 


 


""You're going to hold back for a moment, Harry,"" Hermione said. When he started to argue, she held up a hand. ""Bill and I fly out first and cause a distraction. When they're after us, you fly in.""


 


""And we just fly back into the forest and hide somewhere?"" Bill asked, nodding unhappily.


 


""No,"" Hermione told him. ""Or not like that. We use the Invisibility Cloak to disappear, avoid them, and fly in behind.""


 


""It won't cover the two of you and the broom,"" Harry worried.


 


""It will be enough to confuse them for a few moments. It's the best I can come up with,"" Hermione replied. She was worried, too, but they had limited time and limited resources against a seemingly insurmountable foe. But she and Harry - and 

a

 Weasley - had faced worse odds before and made it out alright.


 


""Why doesn't Harry use the cloak instead?"" Bill suggested.


 


""Because that still doesn't get you and I through and this ritual has to happen tonight because of the calculations we did about the positions of the stars.""


 


He sighed, unable to argue further but clearly not happy with the plan. ""Hold on then, Hermione."" 



And they were off.


 


************


 


Charlie was bored, just like the others. A few of the recruits had actually broken ranks to play exploding snap. This area was so unimportant there weren't even higher-ups anywhere near them to yell at them for it. Word along the line said there was a battle going in the Forbidden Forest somewhere. It made Charlie feel even ancier, wishing he could do something to help the Order. If anything happened to Harry and Hermione...


 


Suddenly, there was a shout, and every head turned toward the forest, several hundred feet in front of them. There was a flash of a very familiar red head and bushy brown hair. Bill. And Hermione. Charlie's blood ran cold for a second and then adrenaline filled his system. He had always worked well under pressure. 


 


He mounted his broom and launched into the air in a fluid motion. He had to dodge a stunner almost instantly, but it did give him an opportunity to recklessly ram against two other recruits, sending a domino effect along several more. 


 


""Sorry bout that,"" Charlie-Bart said, his tone as dry as always. 


 


How else could he help without seeming to? He was a better flyer than Bill, especially with a passenger in front of him, but that would only be useful if he were actually trying to go after them. Still, he wove to the front of the pack. 


 


The fellow with the long scraggly hair laughed, ""What are you going to do, Bartleby? Fall off your broom onto them?""


 


""If that's what it takes to bring them down!"" he shouted back. He could say the right things in the heat of the moment.


 


Still, Charlie had to be mindful not to let them get hurt. Making it seem as careless as possible, he dodged into the path of a slicing hex, grimacing as it cut across his ribs.


 


""Out of the way, you idiot!"" the caster called.


 


He dodged a different direction, catching another spell, some kind of bludgeoning curse this time. Thank Merlin they hadn't learned anything horribly dark yet. Bart's body wasn't as capable of taking a beating as his own.


 


In the corner of his eye, Charlie saw movement over by the forest. Fuck. That's why Bill was being so careless. It was a distraction. Harry had to get through.


 


Yelling as loudly as he could manage, he cried, ""They're getting away, surround them!"" 


 


Charlie hadn't actually expected anyone to listen to him. He had just been trying to drown out the cries from below where a few people had spotted Potter. Yet the jumble of flyers suddenly sent people out in all directions to do what he had said. Damn. That hadn't been his intent. 


 


Still, Harry was being pursued by only a handful, dodging their spells easily and very quickly crossed over the invisible line to essentially pop out of existence. Perfect.


 


Now he just had to help Bill and Hermione out of the mess he had helped create.


 


His brother unexpectedly shot straight up, causing Hermione to scream. Charlie had to bite his lip not to laugh as he suddenly remembered he had never seen her on a broom and realized why. Shite. That only made things harder on Bill. But now he was flying hard back into the forest. Surely he realized they couldn't escape this many people in a chase. There had to be some further plan.


 


As accidental as he could make it look, Charlie raced to the front of the pack, taking a couple more spells on the way. Blaise was going to have his hide when he got back. What was left of it anyway. He was starting to feel a little light-headed from blood loss.


 


Something hit him and Charlie screamed as his arm broke instantly. He saw black for a moment, years of Quidditch and then zooming around with dragons being the only thing that kept him on the broom in that moment. Breathing hard and coaching himself to come out of it, he suddenly realized Bill and Hermione weren't in front of him any longer. 


 


Remarkably, no one else seemed to know where they had gone either. But a small movement beside the trees to his left showed him the peculiar site of a broom end seemingly floating by itself - except it had the lower half of two pairs of shoes hanging near it as well. An Invisibility Cloak. Had to be. But how did they think they were going to manage to get to the castle without being seen when it wouldn't cover everything?


 


Muttering the spell under his breath, Charlie shot a disillusionment spell at them. Thank Merlin it was a nearly invisible spell shooting across the space between them. Still, Bill dodged and Charlie had to try again enough times that he was afraid someone was going to notice - either him casting or see what he had seen of them. He finally landed one and heard Hermione squeak in realization. 


 


""Go low!"" he shouted rather abruptly to drown out the sound.


 


""What?"" the nearest Death Eater asked. 


 


""I was just... thinking of how we can find them,"" he said more normally, talking in Bart's dry tone. He took a sip from his flask before continuing. ""They must be hiding in the forest. Probably went to ground so we couldn't find them. We should fly low if we want to flush them out.""


 


""Nah. We need to hold the line,"" another said.


 


""I think there are plenty to do that,"" Charlie replied. ""Some of us could go in.""


 


Ultimately, he let himself be talked into giving it up. He could only hope he had kept enough of them away long enough for Bill and Hermione to get through. All he knew for sure was that no one had caught them. He made it almost back to his position in line before the blood loss and pain overwhelmed him and Charlie slumped to the ground.

















Surprise! You get an extra mini-chapter because today is this fic's one year anniversary. Incidentally, that means it is also MY one year anniversary of writing fanfic. Well, posting it at least. It's been a wild year and I LOVE it. Thank you all so much for reading this and my other fics. I have so much love for you all, ESPECIALLY those of you who comment and encourage me along the way.

My alpha, omnenomnom, is wonderful for everything she does for me! Especially on busy weekends when she checks over and fixes this stuff even though she's between wild social engagements she's too old for. :P

I still don't own Harry Potter.


Harry's heart was beating too hard. He knew that. He could feel it slamming against his chest, in time with his thoughts.


 



Your fault. Your fault.



 


Madam Pomfrey had given him a once over and told him to lay down, while turning back to Theo. Theo who had gone eerily silent, leaving nothing but Harry's heart echoing words in his mind as he just laid there. Waiting.


 


He hadn't planned on actually doing it, of course, but it turned out Professor McGonagall was near enough to have heard. She shooed him to a bed and he climbed in without complaint, as long as he could still see.


 


So there he lay while everyone else bustled around Theo's bed, keeping him from seeing much, save for Theo's hand hanging off the bed. Every once in awhile Harry's heart would speed up and his mind would comment that it had been too long. But then Theo's fingers would twitch, and start the whole process over again.


 


He wanted to demand that they let him over to... to do something to help him. Even if it was only by being there when he woke. But he didn't.  Instead he watched. Listened. Waited.


 


""Harry!"" he suddenly heard a cry from Ginny. She flung herself at him and he momentarily forgot about Theo as he wrapped his arms around his girlfriend and buried himself in the familiar scent of her hair. Merlin, it had been a long time.


 


""Ginny,"" he whispered reverently. ""I've missed you so much.""


 


""You too,"" she said accusingly, ""And I hear you're still trying to get yourself killed!""


 


""Hey, it wasn't so bad. Mione and Bill flew a distraction... wait. Are they back yet?""


 


""We are now,"" Bill said, limping through the door. Hermione was helping prop him up despite how pale she looked.


 


""What happened to you?"" Ginny asked, though she didn't move to help, her hands clenched in Harry's robes and seemingly uninterested in letting him go, even for her brother.


 


""Death Eater caught me with a slicing hex. Nothing major, just need a little patching up,"" Bill assured, gasping slightly against the pain.


 


""And you, Mione?"" Ginny prompted. Her eyes were scouring their friend and clearly coming up with the thought that she was not okay. 


 


""We flew in, remember?"" Harry said gently, seeing that the mere mention of it made Hermione look a bit green. ""Did you have trouble escaping them?""


 


Hermione and Bill exchanged an odd look. ""No,"" she said slowly. ""It was surprisingly easy actually.""


 


""Really?"" Ginny asked skeptically.


 


""Really,"" Bill confirmed. ""A Death Eater... I mean, we have no idea who they were, just that it was a man from his voice, but he didn't sound familiar. He helped us.""


 


""We followed the plan,"" Hermione jumped in, ""Had them chase us into the forest, then hid and put the invisibility cloak on. But they could still see the end of our broom and our lower legs dangling. Or they would have been able to.""


 


""He helped us. I was confused that he didn't say anything about seeing us. And whatever spell I kept dodging was colorless. But when he finally hit us... I was sure for a second we were done for, but then I realized... it was a disillusionment spell to the bits that were sticking out.""


 


""He... what?"" Harry asked, confused.


 


""That's how we feel!"" Hermione agreed. ""But that's what happened. And then he shouted 'Go low' but made out to the other Death Eaters that it was a plan for how to flush us out of the forest. But it wasn't. It was brilliant, really. I hadn't thought about how they might have been able to see us from below.""


 


""He kept most of them busy arguing and we were able to just sail right in between the few who were holding the line. No one saw us except that Death Eater who helped us.""


 


Everyone was quiet for a moment. Harry was stumped. ""So... we have an ally on the other side? And we have no idea who...""


 


""I might have an idea,"" Hermione said, ""but I want to confirm some things first.""


 


Everyone looked at her. ""Does this have anything to do with your secret source?"" Bill asked quietly. They all glanced around. They were close together and no one else was nearby, but it still wasn't something that was supposed to be discussed. 


 


Hermione nodded, clearly not wishing to tell them anything about Malfoy. Harry knew she was sensitive on the subject even if it seemed like they must be getting along better in the dream world she talked about. He wished he could go with her and let the git know that he had to be good to Harry's sister, but Hermione could hold her own.


 


It looked like Bill was going to ask another question when Madam Pomfrey scurried over. ""Let me check you all out. William - on a bed!"" she snapped. 


 


Harry smiled to himself that Bill lay down immediately as though he were still a student, doing as he was told. Harry had other things to focus on, though. As he ran a hand up and down Ginny's arm, squeezing her close, he looked over to Theo's bed. 


 


""Madam Pomfrey? Is Theo going to be okay?""


 


She looked at him like she wanted to snap at him, too, but thought better of it. ""He'll be fine, thankfully. I knew the countercurse for turning his stomach inside out and thankfully was able to flush the toxic waste out of his blood. He needs a few days of solid 

rest. 

Then he'll be fine.""


 


Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He would never forget the terror he felt watching Theo get hit by that spell and then toppling off the broom moments later. 


 


""Now let's take a look at you,"" she said, having finished her work on Bill. 


 


""I'm fine,"" Harry told her, wanting nothing more than to spend as much time with Ginny somewhere private as possible before the meeting. 


 


""I'll be the judge of that, thank you,"" Madam Pomfrey said crisply. After a few moments of reading diagnostics, she shook her head. ""You haven't let yourself recover from being on the run, Mr. Potter. And the rush of adrenaline today means you're running on empty now. You're taking a rest, as well. All of you are!"" she declared. 


 


Hermione, across the room, protested. ""We can't rest here. The meeting will start soon and the ritual 

has 

to happen tonight. I need to prepare Harry to take over Theo's role and-""


 


""I said all of you, Miss Gran- Mrs. Malfoy,"" Madam Pomfrey said. 


 


""Hermione, please,"" Ginny started.


 


But Hermione shook her head, begging. ""You 

have 

to let us-""


 


""No. I don't. You'll be useless for the meeting - and especially for a ritual - if you haven't had rest. You're even worse off than he is and pregnant on top of it. Whose idea it was to fly in the middle of this Death Eater infested..."" The sound of her mutters faded away as she went back to the potions cabinet and began pulling out bottles of Sleeping Draughts. 


 


""Gin, help me up,"" Harry said. Truth be told, he 

did

 feel awfully tired, but he wasn't telling anyone that. He would be fine. 


 


But she shook her head at him. ""No, Harry. I think you and Hermione should do what Madam Pomfrey says."" He was surprised when Hermione huffed and then lay down as she had been told, too. 


 


""It won't even be for the entire morning,"" Madam Pomfrey informed them as she appeared beside Harry's bed. ""I know they want you at that meeting, but a few hours of sleep will do you all good.""


 


""And it's fine, Harry,"" Ginny said. ""I need to visit Mum then I have some stuff to get done with Severus before the meeting anyway.""


 


""Severus?"" he asked, but his eyes were closing before she could explain. 


 


*******


 


""Fucking pea-brained moron with a fucking death wish,"" Blaise muttered furiously as he scanned Charlie's diagnostic. 


 


'Bart' had been dumped unceremoniously on the floor of the infirmary, just inside the door, looking more than half dead. It had taken three blood replenishing potions to get his skin back to a natural color. Blaise couldn't stop his hands from shaking as he worked on the man he loved, fixing gashes and bruises and setting his broken arm bones. 


 


The man who dropped him off didn't seem to know much about what had happened. He just grunted and said, ""All from our side. He's as much a wreck in the air as he is on the ground.""


 


Yes, Charlie had quickly worked up a reputation as one of the clumsiest Death Eaters in existence. Blaise scolded him for it, but he couldn't deny that he needed those opportunities to see Charlie and know that he was okay, even on the occasions when he couldn't get away with making him stay overnight. 


 


He was excited and horrified that this wasn't one of those times. Charlie would need to stay for several days this time. He needed far more rest than his trainers would allow him if Blaise let him return. 


 


""Are you going to wake him up yet?"" Draco demanded. 


 


He had been next to useless through today's crisis. The clash between the Death Eaters and the Order had been ugly, presumably for both sides. And Blaise was bracing for another wave of them once the Dark Lord finished punishing the ones who had failed - everyone, basically. 


 


""He needs to sleep so he can heal, Draco.""


 


""Not as badly as I need to know what happened to Hermione!"" Draco yelled. 


 


""You're going to wake my patients and we'll have to obliviate them again,"" Blaise hissed. ""Get control of yourself!""


 


Draco growled in frustration. ""I can't. I don't know if she made it. I don't know if she's hurt.""


 


""Again,""Blaise began, gritting his teeth as his patience snapped, ""you would be able to tell if something was wrong with her."" 


 


""I've gotten worry and upset and terror from her multiple times today so I don't-""


 


""But she's fine now,"" Blaise stated. 


 


""She's 

blank 

right now. Like she's... Fuck! Blaise, they've put her to sleep. I need one of those draughts! Now!""


 


""Draco, you idiot, I need your help. And what would I do with you anyway?""


 


He stood still for a fraction of a second before he stormed over to ""his"" bed where the real Bartleby lay and plucked a hair. ""I'll be Bart for now and Charlie can sleep in 

your

 bed. In the room.""


 


Fucking Draco and his fucking brilliant ideas. 


 


*********


 


He nearly tackled her when he arrived. Draco's arms crushed her to him and she could feel his wild heartbeat against her. He didn't even speak, just held her tight. 


 


Hermione wanted to push him away because, even with the kiss they had shared not that long ago, 

this

 felt too personal. Frighteningly personal. Like he cared. Like she 

wanted 

him to care. 


 


Because she liked it. It was upsetting to realize, but Hermione had never been one to hide from the truth. She wanted Draco to care about her. She wanted him to hold her like this when she returned from something harrowing. 


 


Instead of standing rigid as she had last time he waylaid her like this, she melted into his arms. It had been a horrific morning and, dear Merlin, she wanted the comfort he was offering. 


 


Maybe it was just the pregnancy hormones, but she wanted to fall apart. And she wanted someone to hold her while she did. That her someone was Draco fucking Malfoy was just a fact of her life now. She might as well accept it. 


 


A sob escaped her at that thought and he clenched her tighter. ""What's wrong?"" he demanded. ""Are you hurt? What happened?""


 


""I'm... I'm fine... everything is okay,"" she sobbed into his chest. 


 


Draco was quiet, clearly confused, but she could hear his heartbeat slowing down, steadying, as he rubbed her back. After a few minutes, he led her over to their fountain and pulled her down. He sat, braced against one side of it, and pulled her so that she was between his legs, her head resting back on his chest, body curled against his. 


 


Frustration filled his voice when he asked again, ""What happened, Granger? I need to know.""


 


She tried to scoff. Her internal beliefs about how an interaction with Draco was meant to go said that he didn't need to know a thing. But instead of any of that, what came pouring out of her mouth was a complete recounting of the morning. Her fear of flying, the awful chase through the forest, the horror of seeing Theo's father try to kill him, watching him fall and then Harry's daring rescue - she didn't notice Draco's reaction to the mention of Theo and his fall. She told him about the hair-brained plan to get Harry and Theo into the castle and the way she and Bill had made themselves bait. 


 


By the time she finally got to the Death Eater who had helped them, her tears had stopped and she was far calmer. The clearing was quiet except for the splashing water. Draco hadn't said a word, just listened to all of it. 


 


""It was one of you, wasn't it? You or Blaise or... I think it was Charlie. Because you and Blaise already have places you're supposed to be. But Charlie's on a dangerous mission he gave himself. He's spying. Isn't he?""


 


Draco didn't answer for a long moment. Then he said, ""I told you before that it's too dangerous for me to share that information.""


 


Hermione felt disappointment flood her. She had thought he would tell her. She had thought-


 


""But if the idiot is going to give himself away like that anyway... yes, I imagine it was Charlie,"" he told her. He sounded like he was trying to sneer and act above Charlie, but at the same time, his tone held respect and a hint of mirth. 


 


""You only imagine?"" she asked, a bit confused that he wouldn't know. 


 


""He's definitely pretending to be a Death Eater. And, knowing him, he was the one doing all of that. But I can't confirm it because he's still unconscious,"" Draco explained.


 


""What?"" Hermione felt panicky all over again at the thought of something happening to another Weasley.


 


""He took a lot of damage. Slicing hexes, bludgeoning, broken bones. Honestly, he was lucky he wasn't hit with anything worse, but he did lose a lot of blood.""


 


""But how?"" she asked, confused. ""I was only shooting stunners and none hit him.""


 


Draco gave her a look somewhere between astonished and pitying. ""Granger, he must have been taking friendly fire. Well, Death Eater fire. It would be inaccurate to call them friendly in any way.""


 


""He... he was flying into the spells they were shooting at us?"" Hermione couldn't keep the tremble from her voice. Of course he was. Charlie would never have let anything happen to Bill when he could stop it. Draco didn't respond, but he didn't need to. His silence said enough.


 


She felt so emotional again, but Hermione managed to hold back her tears. It helped to squeeze the hands in hers. Blinking, she really noticed for the first time that Draco's pale hands were clinging to hers, long fingers wrapped around and his thumbs drawing soothing little circles on the backs of her hands. Had they been like this long? She had no idea. 


 


After a few quiet minutes, Draco spoke. ""Thorfinn Rowle is the one who cast the spell on the Weasel. Blaise hasn't figured out the countercurse yet, but he's trying. Well. He was. Now he's busy with an infirmary full of angry Death Eaters.""


 


""Aren't you supposed to be helping him?"" she asked. He had claimed to be the Healer's Apprentice after all.


 


Draco blushed. ""I should be, but I couldn't focus so Blaise agreed to let me come here and see. I thought... you've been... upset today, and the bond felt blank now, so I was pretty sure you were sleeping. I needed..."" He trailed off without finishing. 


 


""It's been a hard day,"" she said, trying to explain away her emotions.


 


Draco squeezed her hands, still entwined in his, and nodded. ""You don't have to explain. I was bloody terrified all morning. All I knew was what you were feeling. And then my cousin, Rowle has claimed her, so-""


 


""Your cousin? Tonks?!"" Hermione asked, excited. Merlin, to know that Tonks was okay...


 


""Yes,"" he told her. ""I only... I mean, today was the first day we met. Blaise usually takes care of her."" Seeing the look in Hermione's eyes, Draco rushed on, ""She's not in a good situation, Granger, but she's making the best of it, and she knows we, including Charlie, are planning to get her out when we can. And she's bloody tough.""


 


Hermione smiled, thinking how tenacious Tonks could be. Draco's next words just confirmed it.



 



""Tonks had been listening in as Rowle got information, so she told me that you and Potter were being moved. They knew the plans to fly. It's why they lined the perimeter of Hogwarts as they did.""


 


""They didn't believe me,"" she said quietly, realization shooting through her with hurt following just behind. ""About Ron. They didn't listen and we could have died because of it.""


 


There was silence for a moment before Draco spoke again. ""It's strange.""


 


""That they don't listen to me?""


 


""No. They're idiots. I'm not surprised in the least that they ignore the only one who's not a halfwit.""


 


""Then what?""


 


""Caring about someone. Worrying like this. Strange and bloody well terrifying.""


 


""Caring about me you mean?"" Turning and staring up into Draco's face, she saw that his eyes were open and vulnerable, worry and anger warring inside them.  He shook his head.


 


""It's more than that,"" Draco responded. ""I don't know if it's the bond or if I'm just so desperately sick of all this death that I don't want to see anyone else hurt. I suddenly 

care

 for people. You. Blaise. Charlie. Even my cousin, which makes no sense since I barely know her.""


 


""Did you ever consider that you may just be becoming a better person?""


 


""I wouldn't go that far."" Drawing a hand away from hers, he brought it up to touch her hair, his fingers toying with a curl. He seemed almost in a trance. ""I'm selfish in that way. Whenever I know there is danger it feels like poison in my stomach. Pure, liquid fear. I hate not knowing if you're safe,"" he whispered, the words sliding from his lips like a secret. ""Especially when I know you're probably not.""


 


""I..."" Hermione wasn't sure how to answer. She didn't worry about him overly much. But it was becoming harder not to. He was in constant danger, and he was helping them now. And he seemed... different. 


 


There was sadness in his molten grey eyes when he said, ""You don't have to feel the same, Hermione. I wouldn't like me much either. Not after all the things I've done. The bond affects me more because I'm alone. You have plenty of people who already care for you of their own volition.""


 


""Draco... I don't... I would be lying if I said I think of you all the time, but... I care about you. I 

do 

think about you sometimes.""


 


He smiled, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. ""That's enough for now.""


 


Knowing it was silly, Hermione still didn't want to leave the conversation there. Some part of her badly wanted Draco to understand that the affection was deeper now. She just didn't know how to find the right words when there was also still anger and hurt between them.


 


But her eyes wandered down his face and fell on his perfect lips. Those damn lips were made for kissing. And if she couldn't tell him how she felt verbally, Hermione knew she could make him understand in other ways. 


 


It was a tentative touch when she leaned up his body, a hand on either of his broad shoulders, and gently brought her lips to his. Draco's eyes fluttered shut as Hermione pressed her body down along his, her lips pressuring his open. 


 


The moment their tongues met, he took over the kiss. Draco's mouth was suddenly insistent against her own and Hermione gave in to the demands with only a token resistance. She wanted his rough, desperate kisses. She wanted to feel his hands running slowly up and down her sides, his fingers twitching as he no doubt coached himself not to try for more. 


 


Did she actually 

want 

more? Hermione felt a thrill go up her spine as he nipped at her lower lip and caused her tongue to dart out to meet his. A tiny moan escaped him when she licked her lips and pressed closer again. 


 


It felt like a duel when they came deeply together, and she couldn't help but love it. She wanted to snog him forever.







Hermione woke with a smile, even though she was irritated that someone had jostled her awake and away from Draco. She swore she could still feel him on her lips and it was impossible to be upset about anything. 











After that brief interlude in happy land, we're launching more intensely back into the story. Hermione is on the war path! But no warnings necessary. This whole chapter is in the castle. Sorry Draco, Blaise, Charlie lovers. I think they'll be back next time, just a lot going on at Hogwarts right now.

Omnenomnom is wonderful. I was quite sick this past weekend and cannot for the life of me get back in the writing groove so I promise I am not exaggerating when I say what I initially handed over to her was garbage and she had her work cut out for her getting me in shape this time. It hasn't been run through anyone else because, well, I want to post it on the day i consider it ""due."" I suspect AStrangeFan, StarGirlPotter, and highlyintelligentblonde will let me know of any errors once they read it and I'll stealth edit said errors away. I love you people!

I don't own Harry Potter.


Her good mood didn't last, but it was replaced with a steely confidence. Draco's words were ringing in her ears as Hermione stormed through the castle toward the planning rooms. 


 


""You nearly got us killed!"" she proclaimed as she slammed the doors open dramatically. ""For all your talk about your precious savior you didn't listen to the one blasted person who had the information to protect him.""


 


""Herm-"" Dean started.


 


As she should have expected, Ron was there. He was on some sort of stretcher type chair, clearly unable to sit up, but they had him propped next to Kingsley. Minerva, Dean, a couple of aurors, and the man Finian who she had only briefly met before were gathered around a table covered in maps and tiny magical figures, with parchment pieces here and there, perhaps with labels or information scrawled across them. The mouths of all those present were hanging open in surprise at her entrance.


 


""Why is he 

still

 here? Do you want Harry dead? Do you want this whole operation to rot from the inside out?"" Hermione shouted at them, pointing to Ron. ""I told you. I 

told you

 that they are using his eyes and ears. It's part of the bloody curse. Get him out of here!""


 


""Mione?"" Ron asked. ""Is that you? I have so many things I need to-""


 


""Don't you dare! Not one single word about me, Ronald! Nothing about... any of the things anyone knows about me. Do you hear me?""


 


Ron grumbled, but said, ""I hear you. My hearing is fine right now.""


 


""Thank Merlin for that. Perhaps it means they're not listening in. Can you see as well?""


 


""Not sure. They've made me wear this blindfold."" He moved to take it off and Hermione stormed over, beating his hands down off his head. 


 


""This isn't a bloody game,"" she raged at them. 


 


""Miss Granger-"" Minerva began.


 


""No! You don't get to 'Miss Granger' me when you've just been party to nearly getting me killed. I have the utmost respect for you in most circumstances, Minerva, but I am 

appalled

 that you - all of you - chose not to heed my warning.""


 


""Hermione, you have to admit the way you say the curse works is a little absurd,"" Kingsley started. ""I can't have your personal disagreements interfering with the-""


 


""There is nothing personal about this other than my concern for Harry, which 

you

 could clearly learn from. And absolutely 

nothing

 is too absurd for the Death Eaters to try, for them to create, no matter how far-fetched it sounds,"" she hissed at them.


 


""According to your source?"" Kingsley pushed back in his chair, crossing his arms. ""He isn't trustworthy, Hermione. And you won't even tell us how he is getting it to you. The son of-""


 


""Don't you dare! Get Ron out of here before you say another word!"" she demanded.


 


""Mione, I need to apologize-""


 


""I don't care what you need!"" she snapped. ""You do owe me several apologies. But you can start to atone for them by not saying another single word about me until they have found a countercurse and lifted this from you entirely. Do you understand me?""


 


""Hermione, be reasonable,"" someone said, but Hermione was beyond caring. 


 


She lifted her wand and everything stopped. She didn't even say a word, just the thought that everything had to stop, and it did. Her mind caught up a moment later, realizing how out of control her emotions had become and that Draco had given her his magic without her even realizing she had reached out. Did she ask? She had promised him she always would. But she hadn't known it was going to happen. How was that possible?


 


Now was not the time. Shaking her head to clear the thoughts, she stormed forward to her unblinking victims. They were staring at her with varying expressions of fear, shock, horror, and respect in their eyes, the only thing that could still move. 


 


""Ronald is leaving 

now

,"" she said, moving her hand toward him. 


 


He and the stretcher chair he was in sped from the room. She wasn't entirely sure where he was going to end up and she almost didn't care except that he might overhear something else. Storming over to the doors, she poked her head out and saw Lee Jordan looking stunned by the fact that Ron and a stretcher had just appeared in the corridor. 


 


""Lee, take Ron to a room somewhere alone, then come back and let us know where he is. Not any of the towers, nowhere other people could be seen or heard, and don't speak to him on the way. Put him in a full body bind or seal the room or whatever you need to do to keep him there. We'll see to him in a bit.""


 


""Hermione? Are you sure-"" He cut himself off. With a curious and then alarmed expression, Lee nodded, using his magic to levitate Ron off somewhere. Hermione didn't care where as long as it didn't endanger anyone else.


 


Turning back into the planning room, she looked around at them. She could release them now, but she needed them to listen without interrupting for a few - probably long - minutes. 


 


""Until a countercurse is found, Ron is absolutely compromised. Even in the moments he can see and hear, we are not sure the Death Eaters can't as well. Not to mention that they can take over those senses at any moment.""


 


""Whether we like it or not our 

source

 is my husband and he is loyal to me. Despite his past he has shown his commitment to me and has proven to be more trustworthy than half the people in this room."" Hermione glared at Kingsley. ""This is not a question. It doesn't matter who his father was. He is one of us. So is Blaise Zabini. I would trust my life with anything they told us. Even if I didn't, they're the best you have and I won't have you endangering our only inside source.""


 


""You not only came close to losing Harry today, and Theo and I, who are essential to this ritual that needs to be done, but far more Order members, experienced and not, were endangered for no good reason! There was no way for any of this information to have slipped early enough for them to use it other than your loose tongues in front of Ron. Unless one of you want to confess to turning traitor?"" Hermione met each of their eyes but saw nothing but steely resolution. ""I thought not.""


 


""We cannot win this if you won't trust our sources and continue to make assumptions based on prejudice! We are better than this! We are smarter than this! 

I

 am smarter than this, at least, and I won't step aside and watch you destroy our world. We are no longer children and you cannot treat us like such while at the same time having us fight a war for you. Either we are children not to be trusted with things like wards, fighting and planning. Or we are a valued part of this resistance and my words will be given the same weight as any of yours. More really, since none of you know a bloody thing about what's going on."" 


 


Hermione glared around at all of their wide eyes. With another thought, she snatched the magic from the air and they could all move again. She didn't even use her wand this time.


 


There was a long moment of stunned silence. Finally, Minerva said, ""Miss Granger-""


 


""Mrs. Malfoy, thank you,"" Hermione snapped, the words flowing out before she thought them through. ""I am Hermione Granger, but I am also Draco Malfoy's 

wife

.""


 


""But you're not really-"" Dean began.


 


""By law and magic, whether I like it or not, I am his wife,"" Hermione said darkly. She wasn't sure why she was arguing this point, why she had suddenly decided to embrace it. But if they couldn't respect Hermione Granger, perhaps being the dangerous wife of a Death Eater would make more of a difference.


 


""Mione, we all know you don't want to be with him. Malfoy forced you.""


 


""No. That evil snake forced us both. And... and I won't hold it against Draco. It wasn't his fault any more than it was mine. Whatever happens between us is strictly between 

us

. But to all of you, to the world and to magic, he is my husband. I suggest you remember it.


 


She could see the shock on Minerva's face for a moment before the Professor recovered herself and said, ""You have... several reasonable points, Mrs. Malfoy. It is not so much 

who

 your information comes from-""


 


""Though you have to admit we have reason to not trust a Malfoy,"" one of the Aurors cut in.


 


Hermione glared at him, but Minerva continued, ""It is not so much who, but 

how

 you are getting your information that is suspicious. Andromeda did not explain and it was my understanding that you could not speak through your bond.""


 


Pursing her lips, Hermione tried to decide if she wanted to tell them. Would they believe in her dream world more or less? Looking at their serious faces, she knew her answer. ""We can't, but you'll just have to trust me that we are able to get some messages to one another. It's not a fast method. He can't warn me of last minute attacks. But information about this curse - about how vital it is that Ron 

not

 be in the middle of your planning sessions? That kind of information he can sometimes get to me in time for it to be useful. 

If

 anyone bothers to listen.""


 


""Why should we trust the wife of a Death Eater?"" Finian asked. Hermione remembered that he and Ron were close. 


 


She started to retort, but Kingsley, Minerva, and Dean, as well as one of the aurors, came to her immediate defense. 


 


When the chaos became too much, Kingsley raised his hands for attention. ""Fin, you have never had the honor of knowing Hermione, but I know you've heard enough about her - and from more than just Ron - to know her reputation. She was married to Malfoy under duress, but they are learning to work together it seems. Are you certain you can't tell us how?"" he asked Hermione.


 


""No. It would be too dangerous,"" Hermione lied. Well, it wasn't a lie if telling them meant that they would dismiss the information they received from Draco. ""The Order clearly leaks like a sieve. We lose our method, we lose all information.""


 


Minerva nodded. ""We trust you. Especially after today's attacks prove they knew our exact plans."" The formidable woman looked around at the others who were gathered in the room, glaring down anyone who might have argued.


 


""What will we do for a commander for the forces then?"" Dean asked.


 


Kingsley smiled at him. ""Are you volunteering?""


 


""No. I have the recruits. Harry's a big help with them, but he has his own things to handle.""


 


""Training them is more than we asked of you and we appreciate it,"" Kingsley told him.


 


Dean glowed under the praise. ""It was Harry and Theo's idea, but it's what we all needed while we're stuck out on our own,"" Dean said. ""Now there's a purpose to being there.""


 


""So the young..."" There was a pause as Kingsley glanced Hermione's way. ""...men who joined us - Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle - have not been detrimental to the cause?""


 


""Greg's a powerhouse when it comes to helping me teach. He's um... not the smartest fellow, but if you tell him exactly what to do, he's fantastic at it.""


 


Hermione stepped up, ""Theo is one of the most intelligent and resourceful people I have ever come across. He is as much an asset as I am and his commitment is as strong as Harry, Ron, and I.""


 


""You expect us to believe-"" Finian began.


 


""Yes!"" Hermione snapped. ""I do expect you to believe that the son of a Death Eater doesn't have to be one, too. Theo is intelligent, he helped create the ritual we will be performing tonight, and we're working together on the larger one to repair the castle's sentience and ability to protect itself.""


 


""He's also a dynamic fighter and easily handles Harry's moods when he's in a funk. Different way than Ron ever did, but it seems to work,"" Dean added. 


 


""Mrs. Malfoy, we appreciate your concerns and will find somewhere safe to put General Ron until Severus or Mr. Zabini find a countercurse for him. You have my word,"" Minerva looked at her seriously. ""For now, we need you to leave unless you wish to join the war council.""


 


""No thank you,"" Hermione said. ""I have preparations to make for tonight's ritual.""


 


""And don't forget the meeting,"" Kingsley added. 


 


""I doubt anyone will let me,"" she said with an eye roll as she walked out the door.


 


Hermione rushed back to the infirmary, knowing she needed to make sure Harry was going over his parts as he should. Of course he was missing entirely. 


 


She was just about to rush out when she heard a groggy, ""Mione?""


 


""Theo?"" Hermione cried, turning back and rushing to his side. ""How do you feel?""


 


""Like shite,"" he replied. ""What happened?""


 


Hermione gulped. She didn't really want to be the one to explain what his father had done.


 


""He tried to kill me, didn't he?"" Theo asked, eyes bright with what was probably a fever. 


 


Putting her hand on his forehead to confirm it, she nodded but said, ""Let me go get Madam Pomfrey for you.""


 


As she started to walk back toward the other wing - there were two of them now - he said, ""Wait, please. Where's Harry? Is he okay?""


 


""Yes. He's fine. He caught you when you fell. I'm sure he'll be excited to tell you about it after I find him and murder him.""


 


""What's he done now?"" Theo asked, laughing, but then clutching at his aching body.


 


""Gone wandering off when he should be practicing for tonight,"" she told him.


 


""Why?"" 


 


""You can't very well do it in the state you're in, Theo. It will have to be Harry,"" Hermione said.


 


""No. I can still-""


 


""We'll worry about it later. Let me get Madam Pomfrey right now.""


 


Theo looked like he wanted to protest, but Hermione moved quickly away. It took her very little time to find Madam Pomfrey. It took her longer to approach once she realized whose bed she stood by.


 


Mrs. Weasley looked old, old and frail. Her hair was grey. She had obviously lost a considerable amount of weight. Percy and George sat next to her on the bed. Bill was standing nearby as Madam Pomfrey worked. Hermione wasn't completely sure what she was doing, but there were spells as well as potions that George periodically held her up for Percy to give her. 


 


When Madam Pomfrey finished, Hermione called her to the side and explained that Theo was awake. She wasn't certain after that if she should go or stay, but Mrs. Weasley solved the problem for her. In a very soft voice, she called out. ""Hermione, is that you? Bill said you made it safely.""


 


""It's me, Mrs. Weasley. We're all fine,"" she said, stepping closer. She almost instantly knew she didn't want to be there. Seeing the woman she thought of as a second mother in this situation was heartbreaking. She could only imagine how her actual children were handling it. 


 


Mrs. Weasley reached out for her, so Hermione took her hand. She couldn't believe how weak the woman's hands were. Mrs. Weasley was supposed to be pulling Hermione in for one of those bone-crushing hugs, not barely able to grasp her hand.


 


""It's so good to see you, dear,"" the older - much older now - woman said. ""I wasn't sure I would again.""


 


Hermione had to hold back a sob she hadn't been expecting. Mrs. Weasley patted her hand lightly, the best she could do at comfort, Hermione realized - not that 

she

 should be comforting Hermione in this situation.


 


Mrs. Weasley said, ""Don't be sad. I'm still here for now. My only complaint is that I won't be here to protect my children - including you. And I'd love to see my kitchen again. But did you know my Ginny has taken up cooking?""


 


Hermione listened as Mrs. Weasley continued to ramble about all her children, including the many, many she had ""adopted"" along the way. It was all Hermione could do for her.


 


**************


 


Harry knew he wasn't entirely welcome here, but Ginny seemed delighted to have him helping, so he ignored Snape's glowering. Now that he 

knew

 about Snape's feelings for his Mum, it was even weirder to be around him than ever before. At least his dislike finally made sense. Somewhat, anyway. He was Mum's son, too, but he knew he looked just like James.


 


They were making treats for the upcoming meeting. Pumpkin biscuits that were meant to promote harmony. As Ginny explained the theory of putting one's emotions into the batter they were mixing, Harry had to ask, ""Is my presence here going to promote dis-harmony?"" 


 


""I leave the emotional muck to Ginny. It will be fine,"" Snape drawled, nonetheless walking away as it came time for her to add the emotional components.


 


""How do you do this?"" Harry asked.


 


""It's mostly just about intention. I think about the results I want, really focus on them, and pull up my magic to push it in.""


 


""Can I help?"" Harry asked, watching Ginny out of the corner of his eyes. Seeing her with flour on her cheek and the dimple in her cheek as she thought about the emotions she wanted and smiled made his heart melt.


 


She turned that smile on him and nodded happily. ""Think about everyone getting along and working together. Now work the dough like this."" Ginny showed him how to knead it - not a step biscuits would normally require, she explained, but essential for adding the proper magical influence in this case. 


 


Harry felt his magic reaching up to help hers, dancing together in perhaps more than harmony. ""Is that going to be-""


 


Ginny was blushing when she said, ""Maybe that's enough harmony from you, Mister. We don't want the meeting to turn into a mass snogging session.""


 


""Or worse,"" Snape said, looking thoroughly disgusted.


 


Ginny rolled her eyes. ""You know, Severus, you might be in a better mood if you-""


 


""Don't you dare finish that sentence, Ginevra,"" he cut in.


 


Harry couldn't stop himself from laughing. When his old Professor glared at him with thoroughly pink cheeks, he couldn't help from laughing harder.


 


""Perhaps the two of you should find somewhere else to practice your ah... harmony while I finish baking these.""


 


""Thanks, Sev!"" Ginny grinned, grabbing Harry and dragging him out the door.


 


Before he knew what was happening, they were in an alcove with Ginny's tongue in his mouth. Harry had absolutely no complaints about this turn of events. In fact, he would be perfectly happy to skip the meeting, the ritual, everything, if he could just stay with Ginny like this.


 


**********


 


George had been looking for Hermione since he was released from the hospital wing himself, but it seemed like he was always a few steps behind her. He had followed her to the planning room, hearing from Lee what had happened with Ron. There, he had been conscripted briefly to help deal with his younger brother, but that thankfully hadn't taken long. Now he was headed up to the library when a quick trip back to the infirmary said Hermione had been with Mum for a while, leaving the ward crying after she fell asleep.


 


He knew Hermione. She would have sought refuge. Sure enough, he found her with her knees curled up to her chest, crying in a window seat at the back of the library. It was windy where she sat, the window having been blown out during the battle and not yet repaired. She was bloody lucky the whole area hadn't tumbled outward when she chose to sit there. It wasn't without precedent.


 


Sitting down next to her, George pulled the girl into a tight hug. ""You've seen Mum, Madam Pomfrey said.""


 


""Oh George! I'm so sorry,"" she whimpered onto his shoulder.


 


""Don't be, love. You had nothing to do with it. And tonight we ward the castle so it won't happen again. That'll be your doing. And... she's not gone yet. Madam Pomfrey has some hope that she could get better.""


 


""Really?"" Hermione asked. He could hear that she was fighting her own skepticism.


 


George shook his head. ""I don't think it's likely, but Madam Pomfrey says it anyway. I think it's to keep Dad from falling apart, honestly.""


 


""Your poor father,"" Hermione said, trying to hold back more tears. ""I'm so tired of all this, George.""


 


""You and me both, Mione. But we're going to make it through. And we're going to win. I refuse to accept anything else,"" George told her. ""Right now, it's time for the meeting.""


 


""Oh, Merlin. I haven't found Harry!"" Hermione panicked, starting to pull away from him.


 


""Five galleons says he shows up with Ginny,"" George grinned, pulling her back down to the window seat. ""Don't worry so much. You're brilliant and you're going to pull this ritual off just fine.""


 


""But I have to have a counterpart and Theo's not able now but Harry hasn't practiced and I don't know...""


 


""Is it written down?"" George asked. ""I'm fair at rituals.""


 


""You... you've done ritual magic?""


 


""Freddie and I..."" his face and voice darkened momentarily, ""we performed rituals now and then to protect ourselves while testing things. Once, we used a ritual to bless a number of items to be used in products. I have some experience, though it wasn't for this specifically.""


 


Hermione looked undecided, but then she pulled out a long piece of parchment, tapped it once with her wand, and handed it to him. George skimmed it, whistling when he realized the complexity of the rituals they would be handling.


 


""Well, I know I can help with this first one, to call the candidates. I'm not as sure about the true ritual. And I see it's not even the final one. Merlin, Hermione. This is a 

lot

 to tackle,"" George said.


 


""I know. I need Theo. He has more experience and he wrote half of it. He knows the whole thing by heart. But having your help for the first part will be immeasurably useful,"" Hermione said, the relief thick in her voice.


 


""Good,"" George told her, standing and pulling her up, too. ""Now it's time to see what the Order has to say.""


 


***********


 


When they arrived at the meeting, it was chaos. There seemed to be a lot of worry about Harry and Hermione, for one, though her appearance helped calm people. She hated it, but she couldn't deny the truth. She was irritated by the fact that Harry was still nowhere to be found. But neither was Ginny yet. There also seemed to be a lot of worry over two young women standing up front. George stopped as he looked them over.


 


""What is it?"" Hermione asked.


 


""Just stunned by beauty,"" he said, indicating one of the girls. They both had long blond hair, though one was curlier than the other. That one looked vaguely familiar somehow, but the one George had indicated was not anyone Hermione recognized. She had perfectly symmetrical features and held herself like a goddess. Judging by the cold, collected gaze she had while scanning the crowd, the girl was undoubtedly a pureblood.


 


Those must be the two young Death Eaters who had surrendered. They looked terrified, but the pureblood seemed determined to stand up straight and face her fate. The younger looking one was scanning the crowd and looked like she was desperate to find someone. Who did she remind Hermione of? 


 


Snape walked in with two overflowing trays full of biscuits in front of him. She hadn't believed it until this moment, but it appeared he really 

had

 taken up baking. Now where was Ginny?


 


There she was, following along looking disheveled but thoroughly unapologetic about it. Harry, on the other hand, was red-cheeked and staring at the floor. Snape looked smug. Hermione could only imagine the scene that must have occurred. 


 


Hermione waved to Harry, but he resolutely ignored her. When she started to stand and march over to him, George grabbed her and yanked her back down, whispering, ""Don't cause a scene. You can yell at him after the meeting."" He handed her a biscuit and, as she nibbled, she found herself feeling calmer about it. They would work things out.


 


The first order of Order business was indeed the girls. ""Introduce yourselves,"" Kingsley commanded. 


 


""Who cares about their names?"" ""They're just Death Eater scum!"" Various people from the crowd jeered and Hermione was glad when Harry was almost instantly on his feet proclaiming they be given a chance. 


 


""I'm Astoria Greengrass, but I go by Story,"" said the paramount of perfection. ""I was indeed a Death Eater, though he rarely marks a woman."" She raised her sleeve to show that her arm was still creamy white and perfect. Hermione felt a twinge of irritation that the girl could have been a Death Eater and still have perfection there when she was marred by Bellatrix's scar.


 


""And your name?"" Kingsley asked the curly-haired girl. She was shaking so hard she couldn't seem to speak.


 


After a pause, Story said, ""Her name is Magenta Brown. She prefers to be called Maggie. Her older sister Lavender might be here?""


 


There was a hush, then angry murmurs. Story looked alarmed and Maggie started crying as no one stepped forward. 


 


""What is Maggie's story?"" Professor McGonagall asked the Greengrass girl.


 


""She's a Slytherin, and got swept up when the Dark Lord's men came for new recruits. She had been living with my family since we did not know where her sister or parents were."" There was an unspoken suspicion that they were likely dead. ""It was a situation, for both of us, to join them as they wished, or be compromised and killed.""


 


""You expect us to believe that?"" someone sneered.


 


""I expect you to at least give them a chance,"" Harry said, rising so that others could see his support as well as hear it..


 


""They're Death Eaters!"" an Auror cried. George made a sound next to her that Hermione took as agreement. She couldn't say that she was feeling particularly merciful at the moment either.


 


""They're barely more than children,"" Harry retorted. ""I'm not saying to trust them with all of our secrets. But they needn't be punished, either. They were under duress."" 


 


""So they say,"" Angelina said. Her reproachful glare at the two girls, and momentarily at Harry, made Hermione wonder if she had some previous interaction with these particular girls or if her anger toward Death Eaters had increased even more for some reason. 


 


""Does anyone know them?"" Neville asked. His eyes were colder than Hermione had ever seen them.


 


""I do,"" said Susan Bones. ""They were Slytherins, but always decent to us."" Hermione noticed that Story was giving the Hufflepuff a decidedly odd look. She must have been shocked that anyone was willing to admit they knew them.


 


Snape stood and said, ""Naturally, I am acquainted with the children."" His oily voice was smooth. ""The Greengrass family, I should remind you, is well known to be neutral politically and as far as pureblood supremacy goes. The Browns are half-bloods. The girl is lucky they were willing to conscript her as a guard instead of a... less desirable position.""


 


""No one needs 

your

 opinion,"" Cormac said to Snape.


 


""What's wrong with his opinion?"" Ginny demanded, standing in her anger.


 


Harry looked frustrated and distressed as he tried to get everyone's attention again, but too many people were yelling at one another. Hermione felt what little patience she had managed to hold in slipping. 


 


""Stop!"" she shouted as she lurched to her feet. A few people did, but that clearly wasn't going to be enough. 


 


With a huff, Hermione sought for a moment to ask Draco for his magic - only there didn't seem any way to manage that. Tugging at it for a moment, there was no response she could discern, but the magic flowed into her. She was almost so focused on the magic that she forgot her initial intent for it. Concentrating, she released the pent up power inside her - that overwhelming glow of her and Draco combined - and brought everything in the room to a halt as she had earlier that morning. 


 


""I 

said

 'Stop.' Squabbling like 5-year-olds won't decide anything! If you can all behave and listen to one person speak at a time, I will release you."" With a deep breath, Hermione let go of the magic, then willed herself to be calm and practical as she continued speaking, no matter how much she wanted to be done with Death Eaters entirely. She would have a talk with Harry about this kind of thing later. For now, it was best to go along with him in front of the crowd. ""Keeping the girls is a risk, but not necessarily harmful to us. They could even be useful."" 


 


""What do you propose we do with them, Hermione?"" Kingsley asked carefully. She could tell he had struggled with which of her names to use. She was pleased with his selection as it was the least problematic.


 


""Wherever you have Ronald, perhaps that would be the best place for them,"" she said.


 


""That will allow the Dark Lord the information that they are here,"" Kingsley noted.


 


""Indeed,"" Hermione agreed. ""It will be up to them what capacity they wish to present themselves. They can behave as prisoners in Ron's presence, or they can let it be known they escaped and help take care of him in the moments he is unable to see or hear. They could do that even as prisoners. It can be their first task to prove themselves.""


 


""What if they kill him?"" Cho asked.


 


""You want him dead,"" Finian accused.


 


Hermione shot him a dirty look. ""Regardless of what else might have happened between us, Ronald is one of my closest friends. I certainly do 

not

 want him dead. They must swear on their magic they will not harm him.""


 


""Will you do this?"" Kingsley asked. 


 


Reluctantly, both girls nodded. They were briefly given their wands and made their vows before handing the wands back and being taken away.


 


Hermione spoke again, ""Whoever takes them up needs a vow from Ron that he will speak of nothing that might help the enemy, including personal information about other members of the Order.""


 


Kingsley looked like he wanted to argue, but finally nodded his agreement.


 


""That brings us to our next point,"" Minerva added. ""Ron, our General, has been compromised and, for the time being, will be unable to act in that capacity. Anyone who is known to be good at strategy, we need your assistance. Please come forward after the meeting.""


 


""Lastly, we have a ritual to perform tonight. Hermione?"" Kingsley gave her the floor.


 


Stepping to the front, Hermione took a deep breath, conjuring a blackboard behind her. Meticulously, she explained the ritual itself. 


 


""Before that, however, we must obviously choose the four representatives. Each candidate will gather within their house, and George and I will be performing the choosing ritual. Later in the evening, Harry and I-""


 


""No, you and 

I

 will be,"" came a stubborn voice from the back.


 


""Theo!"" Hermione snapped. ""You're supposed to be in bed!"" 


 


He was barely standing, but Theo shook his head. ""No way. I'm not missing all the fun when we've spent so long planning this ritual!""


 


""Harry can-""


 


""Hermione,"" Kingsley stepped forward. ""We can argue privately about who will do this with you. Tell me, is this the only ritual we will need? I know you were researching a number of options.""


 


Kingsley knew, of course. He was just asking this way to let the rest of the Order know and to put them at ease about it. 


 


""No. There is this ritual, then a much larger one in the future.""


 


""What is the purpose of this?"" an older woman asked. She had a cat in her arms.


 


""Tonight's ritual will put up much more intense wards around Hogwarts, including on secret passages, the floos, more intense anti-apparation wards. If someone walks into the wards, they will be bounced back. If they try to fight through, they will be transported into a cell where someone will eventually arrive to assess them. These wards are automatic protection.""


 


""That sounds good,"" a variety of people shouted. Others simply clapped or cheered.


 


Neville spoke up, ""With that and the Fidelius, what more do we need? We'll be able to start rebuilding the broken parts of the castle, which was the goal.""


 


""While that is true to an extent, it doesn't take in all of the castle's broken parts. Are you aware of magical places becoming sentient?"" Hermione asked the room at large. Most people were nodding, some with realization in their eyes, though others seemed confused. ""Hogwarts is sentient. It has been since the death of the Founders, I believe, and has become progressively more so over time. 

That

 is the part of the castle that is threatened and requires a more in depth ritual. The wards we will set at that time will be part of the castle's sentience, both protecting and feeding that part of it as well as being able to determine intent on their own and react accordingly.""


 


""That sounds like it will require a lot,"" Susan said, worry evident in her tone.


 


""It will,"" Hermione admitted, taking a deep breath. ""These rituals will require blood magic.""


 


Chaos broke out. Hermione could have held everyone again, but she was honestly becoming tired and did not want to expend the energy for another time. Plus, this was an expected outrage. She let them yell themselves out. 


 


Finally, Minerva managed to regain order and turned to Hermione, ""Are you saying that today's ritual will require blood as well?"" Her eyebrow was raised.


 


""Minimally,"" Hermione agreed, keeping her spine straight and her eyes focused on Minerva. She would not show them weakness. 


 


""Then this larger ritual - it will require more?"" Minerva followed.


 


""It will,"" Hermione told her. She couldn't lie about it. ""But it is the only way to keep the castle from dying. From the research Theo and I have been doing, I suspect if Hogwarts herself fails completely, the whole structure will fall.""


 


Theo nodded solemnly from where he leaned. They had been debating that point only yesterday, but he was clearly going to support her, whatever she declared to their audience. For a moment, Hermione wondered if he had just been winding her up when they argued over it last.


 


""That would have been good to know before we started this path,"" Kingsley said, lips thinning.


 


""It would have, yes,"" she agreed. ""But it wouldn't have changed anything.""


 


Sighing, Kingsley asked, ""Is that everything you needed the assembled members to know?""


 


""Yes. Those who will be candidates, with the full knowledge that a few drops of your blood will be involved, please meet in the Great Hall in an hour.""













UPDATE 10/24/2021: I have not abandoned this, but my muse has at the moment. I hope to get the next chapter out this week, but I'm really struggling with getting it right. I apologize!

 

TRIGGER WARNING: Implied rape in the second segment; dubious consent in the last segment.

I apologize for being a day late. September has been a wild and challenging writing ride in the DFW facebook group. WIPtember focused on WIPs, but I did not choose this specific one as my focus piece, so it got a bit behind.

On a positive - at least from my perspective - keep an eye out for my new story ""Crooked Fates,"" a Hermione/Prewett Twins, which I'll probably start posting in the next week or two depending on how long edits take. It is FINISHED before I ever start posting, minus the editing. I wrote 60k on that story alone this month, not counting four chapters of this and a chapter or two of Weasley Magic. It's been a crazy month. 

For any who follow Hic Sunt Dracones as well, Om is trying to get it out today but she has a lot going on at the moment so it may be a few more days or even next week. I know it's rough at the end of the piece, but try not to murder us. It's worth the wait, really. Mostly. *evil laughter*

ANYWAY. About this actual chapter. Normally if there is some Latin or other language, I put it in end notes. This chapter has so much that I placed the translation in parentheses next to it. Also, I was using google translate, so if you know Latin and something is incorrect based on what I have in the translated part, let me know and I can change it! Had I gotten this chapter written on time, I could have sent it to highlyintelligentblonde who *does* know Latin. Alas, I was a slacker.

This week my alpha/beta was StarGirlPotter. Thank you!

I still don't own Harry Potter.

""You are not going to try to kill yourself for this ritual,"" Hermione insisted.

""You would,"" Theo argued back just as insistently.

""Are you even allowed to be out of the infirmary right now?"" 

""Not really,"" he admitted shamelessly. ""But I won't go rest until you promise me I can be part of the ritual tonight.""

Hermione bit her lip. Merlin, she didn't want to tell him. ""You may have to play a different role in it,"" she said.

His sharp eyes stared into hers and she saw him clicking pieces together. ""Why are there no other Slytherins?"" Before she could speak, she saw his face tighten in a way she wouldn't have noticed if she hadn't spent so much time with him. ""Where's Goyle?""

Biting her lip, Hermione told him. ""He's missing. We don't...""

""He's dead. Merlin."" Theo slumped against the nearest wall, seemingly unable to stand on his own. 

""We don't know that he's dead. He just... He didn't come back to us,"" Hermione qualified, knowing it wouldn't be much better. She hadn't realized...

""That's worse! Do you not see how much worse that would be?"" Theo demanded. ""We can only hope he died before they got their hands on him."" He was shaking hard. There were tears sparkling in his eyes, though Hermione could tell he was fighting not to let them fall. 

""Theo-""

""No! You don't understand! You can't. They'll- Merlin. They'll make his father kill him. Or his Mum. Draco or Blaise if they've already offed the older Goyles. And it wouldn't be an easy death. That snake bastard will make them torture him to death. Greg... he doesn't deserve it. He doesn't... how did he get separated?""

Hermione shook her head. Whatever happened to Greg Goyle from here, knowing he had sacrificed himself for Theo wouldn't help. ""We don't-""

""You're lying,"" Theo stated flatly. ""Don't lie to me."" In that moment, Theo looked every inch the dangerous Slytherin they were supposed to believe in. Hermione had no doubt he would kill someone with that look on his face. Even when he softened it, she could still see it in his eyes. He would kill someone if he had to, for the people who mattered to him. She just wished she knew who fell on that list and who didn't. 

Theo turned away from her. ""When people sacrifice themselves for me, I want to know, Granger,"" he said gruffly. ""So I can help them out or avenge them, one or the other, but I deserve to know.""

""Malfoy,"" she responded, almost automatically. 

Theo turned his head to look back at her over his shoulder. Hermione could see the tears tracking down his cheeks. ""Malfoy what?""

""I'm not Granger. I'm Malfoy.""

""You're claiming him?"" Theo asked in surprise. ""That's new.""

""It is, but... I think it may be the magic. That passage about authenticity. I'm done being annoying, bossy but meek Hermione Granger. I'm Hermione Malfoy and I don't take other people's shite.""

Theo grinned, even though there was still a tear glistening on one cheek. ""Glad to hear it, Mrs. Malfoy. Now I'm going to go and rest for as long as I can. I'll be at the choosing ritual in an hour. Thanks for finding a stand-in for it. Even if I'm picked, I should be able to help with part of it tonight."" 

""If you're picked, we'll work with Harry,"" Hermione insisted.

""What if he's picked, too?"" Theo asked.

Laughing, Hermione said, ""Then I hope you're ready for everything you would have to do with each other if your Sex Magic theory turns out to be true.""

For one moment, Hermione saw a look in his eyes that she couldn't interpret. Did that mean... would he be okay with Harry? Of course not he knew Harry was with Ginny. She shook her head to chase the questioning thought away as Theo turned and headed back toward the hospital wing. Hermione had too much to do to worry about it.

************

Fury didn't begin to describe the emotion Severus was experiencing. Again, they had been keeping Slytherin children in this damned castle, locked away somewhere without their Head of House aware of it. Girls, this time. Not that it should matter, but it did. 

Severus stormed up to the West Tower, to the old classrooms that hadn't been used in at least a hundred years. They, of course, were in perfect condition beyond the dust and grime of time. Eight doors from the tower itself, he heard voices. Two men Severus vaguely remembered from their school days a few years past, blocked his way. 

""We're to let no one in,"" one of the men told him.

""I'm Severus Snape and I demand to speak to those children who are mine to protect.""

""I remember who you are,"" the other said. ""Just don't care. We know what Death Eaters do to pretty little girls like them and you're not getting your hands on them.""

As overwhelmed with anger as Severus was, he was almost pleased that was their reasoning for turning him away. The way the men sneered about it made him slightly more confident they weren't up to that very thing.

""That sentiment would comfort me if they were not in a cage with a Weasley.""

""You saying something about the Weasleys?"" one of them asked. 

""I am saying that young girls shouldn't be locked in with a man,"" Severus growled at them. 

He could see instantly, though, that they agreed. That insolent Granger brat had come up with the worst possible solution. Now the Dark Lord would know for sure that they had defected. If they were caught...

Severus couldn't think of it. Not when one of his other children was missing and presumed captured. Goyle might be lucky enough to be dead, but Severus doubted it. His fury returned. ""I will speak to the girls. Away from Ronald Weasley,"" he insisted. ""You can be in the room with me. We can be out here in the hall as long as there is a door between Mr. Weasley and myself. You will not say anything to him about my existence. Do you understand?""

The two men looked at each other. Finally, one nodded. He went inside, leaving the other to stare awkwardly at the floor. 

""Professor Snape!"" gushed the young curly-haired girl as she rushed toward him for a hug. How this child had gotten to Slytherin, Severus would never understand. She had the subtlety of a bull and an attention span for planning that equaled a fly's. But the child was quite ambitious. 

Astoria - he refused to call her by the ridiculous nickname Story - followed more sedately behind her. He knew she was 17 at this point, not even a year younger than Daphne. Most didn't realize their age was so close. Astoria had always been tiny for her age. The blood curse that had afflicted her since birth kept her from even starting Hogwarts on time. He guessed the other girl, Maggie, must be 16. Both were far too young to be alone and unescorted in a room with a man, even an injured one. Trust a muggleborn to not understand what that would do to their reputations.

Then Severus had to chastise himself. Loathe as he was to admit it, the insufferable know-it-all was right. This was war and ridiculous notions like that no longer mattered. It angered Severus that his Slytherins were collateral damage but... they were. Their parents, for the most part, had made that choice for them. 

Maggie - whose real name Magenta was so ridiculous he refused to think of her as that - had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but Astoria? She had been destined for this torment. Perhaps that's why she looked so calm about it. 

""What can we do for you, Professor?"" she asked him sedately while Maggie practically vibrated next to her. 

""Are you being treated decently? Has he tried to hurt you at all?"" Severus bit out. It was the last thing he wanted to hear about, but if it was happening, he would listen and then he would make the boy pay harshly.

""Oh Ron's great!"" Maggie gushed. ""He knew my sister, you know."" Her voice turned sad then. Apparently her sister hadn't survived. Severus hadn't heard.

""You are both aware that the Dark Lord is privy to anything said or done in front of him?"" Severus asked as a warning.

""Anything said, yes,"" Astoria agreed. ""He is blindfolded, so our actions won't be reported.""

""So you are saying one thing but doing another?"" Severus asked, wondering at her strategy.

Astoria's eyes cut to her friend. ""No,"" she admitted slowly. ""It will be apparent that we are traitors to the cause.""

Of course. Maggie would be unable to maintain that kind of subterfuge. Astoria was smart enough to know that. Still... ""What were you thinking? Getting captured like that and now exposing yourselves this way?""

""Well we hardly planned for the Dark Lord to have a spy in the fashion of Ronald. He seems quite sweet otherwise,"" Astoria said placidly.

Severus wanted to scream and shake the girl. ""But why did you defect in the first place?""

The look she gave him was not friendly. Nor did it speak much to her opinion of his intelligence. ""Perhaps it has escaped your notice, but the Death Eaters aren't very good to women, particularly young ones."" She sniffed as though the statement was beneath her, but there was real fear in her eyes.

Speechless, Severus ran through the questions he wanted to ask. Most were far too vulgar for the innocent girls they should be, especially Astoria as she was a pureblood. But that was the question. As delicately as he could manage, Severus asked, ""Were your experiences with the Death Eaters inappropriate?""

""I am with child,"" Astoria told him. Her voice was sedate, body held with the rigid perfection expected of a pureblood girl. But there was a slight tremble in her hands, and her eyes had a panicked look. ""It is too early to tell for Maggie, but it is likely she is as well. It would be impossible to say who the father of either might be.""

It took work not to react by cursing or throwing things. He knew his face must reflect his anger, though, because both girls took a step back. Having endured what they had, he supposed that made sense. He had to ask, ""Do you feel safe in a room with a man?""

Maggie was nodding enthusiastically. Astoria held back for a moment before answering. ""The Weasleys are good people. Ronald would not hurt us in any way unless we were attacking him or his loved ones. I am not... comfortable with a man in the room, but I am aware we are safe.""

""I will speak with Professor McGonagall on this,"" Severus growled. ""Do you require anything?""

Maggie piped up, ""She needs potions for her nausea. She's constantly sick.""

Merlin. ""You will both be seen by Madam Pomfrey as soon as I can arrange it. We will get you the potions you need.""

********

Despite his insistence that he would be fine with his part of the calling ritual, George was nervous. It wasn't a long or difficult one, but it was important to get all of it right. A representative from each house, one that embodied the traits of that house, was essential to tie the warding magic to the castle walls. Using their blood would ground the magic and set things up for the next ritual as well.

There was a strange scent on the air, very herbal and clean in an earthy way. The scent of magic, a voice whispered in his mind. George quirked an eyebrow at himself. He wasn't prone to hearing voices unless it was Freddie.

With a worried sigh, George looked out over the crowd already gathered. The House tables were gone for now, the floor of the Great Hall divided into four equal parts with a smaller circle in the center where he stood and Hermione would be joining him soon. To the West, the right-hand side of the room, went the crowd of blue Ravenclaws. To the East, the yellow of Hufflepuff stood in place. The Gryffindors were to the South, closest to the teacher's table and the giant hearth behind it. The Slytherins, few though there were, stood nearest the door, to the North.

There were many standing for Gryffindor, more than enough that George didn't have to feel guilty about not joining them. Hermione had also assured him that if he was the best choice, the magic would choose him from the center anyway. George had a feeling with her and Harry in the room, there was no question that he would not be needed, but he wasn't going to say so. 

Looking to the other houses, he noticed there were more adults present for Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. They would have had less fighters in the previous war, George supposed, so there were more of them still alive. There were still large numbers of students, many of them from Dumbledore's army.

Slytherin was the most concerning. There were only two candidates. One was the young man, Theo, looking like he shouldn't be out of the Hospital Wing, ready to fall over in a stiff breeze. The other was Professor Snape, who looked like he might murder the entire assemblage at any moment. He had stormed in breathing heavily as though he had traveled from a far part of the castle. George noticed his sister exchange an eyebrow heavy conversation with the man over everyone's heads. That was a friendship George still couldn't get used to.

Hermione slipped quietly through the crowd and into the center circle. There was a sound following her that George thought sounded like bells jingling lightly. The song of magic, maybe? That voice that wasn't his or Freddie's was suggesting things again. Perhaps it was magic speaking. 

Hermione spoke firmly when she reached the very center standing right in front of a large, simmering cauldron. Her voice carried through, reaching everyone in the hall. 

""What we are about to do has not happened since the days of the Hogwarts founders. They created this spell themselves, to select their successors before Salazar left and their partnership dissolved, though of course the bonds endured throughout their lives, as will those who are chosen here now. We thank you all for your willingness to let the magic consider you, and to the four who are selected - thank you for the bond that you will accept - to the castle and to each other. I know it has all been explained before, but if any of you wish to step down, now is the time. Once selected, the magic may compel you to the next ritual. We do not wish to entrap anyone who does not wish to be a Hogwarts Guardian.""

There was a quiet moment, but no one moved. Hermione nodded with a small smile. ""Let us begin,"" she called. Her arms rose, wand weaving in an intricate pattern before she began to chant:

""Conditores, Audite vocationem nostram! Auctorem tuum imploramus, electio tua qui erit tui propugnator ad munienda moenia Hogwarts iterum sacra.""  (Founders, Hear our call! We plead your guidance, your choice in who will be your champion to fortify the sacred walls of Hogwarts once more.

Each of the Heads of House, standing with their Houses, added their collective plea, chanting together, ""Ad Fundatores nostros vocamus, unumquemque vestrum ducem petimus. Nobiscum hic loquere.""  (We raise the call to our Founders, each of us seek your guidance. Speak with us here.)

Then Horace Slughorn stepped to the northernmost point, ignoring Professor Snape's glare and Theo's look of disgust, presumably at his Head's refusal to stand as another possibility for Slytherin. ""Salazar Slytherin, Ambitiosus, astutus, versutus ac strenuus. Tuum hic reperi vindicem notarum, Formam repraesentandi et ligandi Sacra haec atria.""  (Salazar Slytherin, the ambitious, the cunning, resourceful and determined. Find here your champion of these traits, the embodiment to represent and bind these sacred halls together.)

A green glow of magic surrounded both Theo and Professor Snape, but nothing happened yet. George intoned, ""Salazar Slytherin electiones suas disputat."" (Salazar Slytherin debates his choices.)

Pomona Sprout was at the Eastern wall, her many possibilities watching avidly as she began to speak. ""Helga Hufflepuff, fidelis, patiens, laborantem, pulchra. Tuum hic reperi vindicem notarum, Formam repraesentandi et ligandi Sacra haec atria."" (Helga Hufflepuff, loyal, patient, hard-working, and fair. Find here your champion of these traits, the embodiment to represent and bind these sacred halls together.)

This time, a yellow glow appeared around only a handful of the people in the circle - three adults George didn't know, Hannah Abbott, and Zacharius Smith. George's words were essentially the same, ""Helga Hufflepuff electiones suas iudicat.""   (Helga Hufflepuff considers her choices.)

To the South, Professor McGonagall was standing as close to the teacher's table as she could without being behind it. She called out, ""Godric Gryffindor, strenuus, fortis, strenuus et audax. Tuum hic reperi vindicem notarum, Formam repraesentandi et ligandi Sacra haec atria.""   (Godric Gryffindor, the courageous, brave, determined and daring. Find here your champion of these traits, the embodiment to represent and bind these sacred halls together.)

The red glow that almost thrummed with life around Gryffindor's finest covered nearly all the people standing among their circle, including Professor McGonagall herself. Looking down, George realized that he was surrounded as well. Curiously, Hermione was not, but then he remembered that, with her pregnancy, she had been given a potion beforehand to render her invisible to the selection. 

She was giving him a look and George jumped slightly in realization before stating, ""Godric Gryffindor electiones suas examinat.""    (Godric Gryffindor examines his choices.)

A slim older man George didn't know stood at the Western most point of the Ravenclaw circle. ""Rowena Ravenclaw, sapiens, ingeniosus, intellectualis qui doctrina. Tuum hic reperi vindicem notarum, Formam repraesentandi et ligandi Sacra haec atria.""   (Rowena Ravenclaw, the wise, witty, intellectual who values learning. Find here your champion of these traits, the embodiment to represent and bind these sacred halls together.)

A blue glow surrounded around half of the crowd in front of the man. George intoned, ""Rowena Ravenclaw, electiones suas studet.""   (Rowena Ravenclaw studies her choices.)

Hermione's wand was flying through the air again. Under her breath, she was whispering words to go along with it, words he knew she and Theo had decided the masses didn't need to know. George focused all his attention on placing the proper ingredients into the cauldron in front of them at the right moment in her chanting. 

Suddenly, she stopped, pointing her wand to the north. ""Vindex tuus, Salazar Slytherin?""   (Your choice, Salazar Slytherin?)

The green light flickered and disappeared around Professor Snape, leaving Theo bathed in light and clearly the chosen one for Slytherin. George hurried forward, staying in the center circle, just on the edge. Professor Snape helped the boy over to him, then George pulled him into the center, staying near to be sure he did not fall.

Hermione turned and pointed her wand at the Hufflepuffs to the East. ""Vindex tuus, Helga Hufflepuff?""   (Your choice, Helga Hufflepuff?)

Within moments, only Hannah Abbott was still covered in the faint yellow glow. With a look in which Theo nodded his ability to stand alone, George went and welcomed her into the center circle.

Pointing to the South, Hermione called on Gryffindor. ""Vindex tuus, Godric Gryffindor?""  (Your choice, Godric Gryffindor?)

The red glows around all the Gryffindors pulsed. George felt the heat of it surrounding him. Finally, after what felt like far too long, it faded, from him, from Harry, from all but one: Ginny. Surprise colored many faces, including his own, as George walked over to welcome her into the center.

Finally, Hermione pointed to the West, ""Vindex tuus, Rowena Ravenclaw?""   (Your choice, Rowena Ravenclaw?)

With precision, the blue glows ended on all but Anthony Goldstein. He stepped forward with a smile, allowing George to welcome him to the center circle. Now he beckoned to the four, lining them up in front of Hermione. 

""Gratias tibi agimus, Fundatores, qui tuum auxilium nobis praebens, ad tuum castrum ac populum suum defendat,"" Hermione chanted formally, ending the calling.  (Thank you, Founders, for lending us your aid to protect your castle and its people.)

Then she looked up at the four and smiled tiredly. ""And thank you for joining us to protect the castle despite the sacrifices you will make.""

George could see how seriously the four were taking this, though Theo was trembling slightly. He moved to help hold him up, and Theo accepted gratefully. ""Hospital Wing, please."" His voice was shaking and almost a moan. 

Slowly, they made their way through the crowd trying to get to Hermione and limped out of the Hall. ""Are you going to be okay to do this ritual?"" George asked him quietly.

""Salazar thinks so,"" Theo responded, though he had paled. 

""Do you know something about the ritual that's worrying you?"" George asked.

Theo seemed to think that over. ""There's a lot of walking,"" he finally said, ""And... there is the possibility of more. I... your sister is not who I would have chosen for Gryffindor. Though I suppose..."" He gulped. ""I suppose it's better me than Professor Snape since your sister is involved.""

George stopped moving. ""What are you saying?""

""Nothing,"" Theo answered hastily. ""We don't know what the bonds will do, what they will ask of us exactly. Especially for this smaller ritual.""

""You've already given blood,"" George said with a frown. ""What else-"" He cut himself off. Theo was apologizing for it being Ginny. Apologizing to him, George, her brother, specifically. It was better him than Snape. Merlin fuck. ""Sex. It may require Sex Magic for a bloody school?""

""The ancients preferred to think of it as fertility magic - for growth and development,"" Theo said quietly. ""And we're not sure. The larger ritual - almost certainly will include something like that and... other things.""

""Other things?"" George felt his temper rising. 

""Anyone who participates will know the possible consequences,"" Theo defended.

""Like we knew today that it might involve 'fertility magic.'""

Theo sighed. ""Do you know how hard it was to get them to agree to just blood magic - even with just a prick of blood?""

""Because that isn't light magic!"" George practically yelled.

""Very little magic has a full light or dark purpose of its own. Those things exist, of course. But most magic is based on the intent of the people involved. Casting for protection, no matter the methods, is light magic. When dealing with ancient magic, those methods are older, less acceptable to today's sensibilities, but not dark,"" Theo passionately explained. 

As he spoke, his legs started to give out and George had to catch him. Throwing Theo's arm around his neck, George practically carried him the rest of the way. He was still angry about the possibilities of the rituals, but he wouldn't fight it right now. They didn't know, and wouldn't until it was done. It would have to be okay.

*************

Harry had to work to pull Hermione and Ginny from the crowd. Hermione looked exhausted and Ginny a little overwhelmed. She had known what the rituals would entail, but he suspected she hadn't really thought she would be the one chosen. Like everyone else, she had probably expected it to be Harry. He had expected it to be him.

And as happy as he was to, for once, not be the Chosen One, he would have preferred it had been someone he wasn't so close to. Though statistically he supposed the Weasleys had been most likely to produce a Guardian for Godric Gryffindor, and any of them would have been too close. Ginny was the one closest to him, though, and Harry didn't like it one bit that she was the one.

Looking to Hermione, he decided that she was going to the Hospital Wing. She needed rest before the ritual that evening. 

""Come with me,"" he beckoned to them both. 

They did, but Hermione baulked - of course - when she realized where they were going. ""Harry, we don't have time for the Hospital Wing. You have to learn the ritual for tonight.""

""And you have to rest,"" he told her stubbornly.

""I'll help him with the ritual,"" Ginny spoke up. ""You really do look like you might fall out at any moment, Mione.""

""But-""

""If you don't rest, I will spend my time snogging instead of learning the ritual and you'll have to have Theo do it while being a Guardian as well,"" Harry blackmailed.

""We don't even know if that would work!"" Hermione cried. 

""All the more reason not to let it happen,"" Harry told her placidly. No argument she could come up with was going to change his mind on this.

""Fine,"" she finally burst out. ""But if this doesn't work because you don't know what to do-""

""It will, Mione. I will, promise.""

""I'll make sure he does. He only gets a snog and cuddle tonight if he properly does his part for the ritual. I didn't give my blood for this just for him to bollocks it up,"" Ginny assured.

They were at the Hospital Wing now. Harry noticed that George and Theo were having an intense conversation over in the other part of the wing, but Theo's eyes met his across the distance. Even from here, he could tell Theo had just gone even paler and George nearly dropped him on the bed as his body went limp. 

Harry had to learn the ritual. No matter how much Pepper-Up they gave Theo, he was in no condition for any part of this ritual, much less to play two taxing roles. ""Let's go practice, Gin.""

**********

Even though she hated to admit it, Harry had been right. She had needed the rest after the calling ritual earlier. Hermione had slept and slept hard without even taking a potion. She had already been asleep by the time Madam Pomfrey made it to her bedside.

She could see the matron now, standing off to the side, her eyes focused on Theo and clearly angry to have him out of bed for this. Hermione was no more pleased, but the magic chose him. 

Multiple times, she had noticed him looking worriedly between Harry and Ginny. Merlin, she hoped this ritual didn't turn into anything fertility based. Dealing with that for the second ritual was going to be bad enough. They had mentioned the possibility in the briefing of course, but they had admittedly covered it in language that most people wouldn't catch. 

The few knowing looks she had gotten were surprised, but then nodded in understanding. The ones who got it were the ones who had, at some point, probably used such magic. And they were apparently willing to accept the necessity without the need to tell everyone in plainer language.

Hermione felt guilty for the subterfuge, but this had to happen. Only, now it might be happening to Theo and Ginny and where would that leave Harry? These bonds weren't just for the moment. As someone with an unasked-for bond, she squirmed with the knowledge of how this might affect her best friend. Did he understand what might happen?

It didn't matter. They had to do it, had to follow the magic whatever it called for. If they would. But the Founders wouldn't have picked them if they weren't the ones who would.

Stepping into the center circle, Hermione nodded to Harry. He called out, ""Everyone to your Houses, please.

When everyone was in place, Hermione raised her wand, sweeping it around as she turned in a circle. ""Omnes astantes testes sunt. Accedunt Fundatores pugiles. Huic potioni sanguinem suum, vitae essentiam, addunt. Vincula perpetua inter eos, inter omnes qui in hoc arce habitant, omnes in hac sacra essentia Fundatoris, omnes tueantur.""    (All those in attendance, bear witness. The champions of the Founders approach. To this potion they add their blood, the essence of their lives. Enduring bonds between them, between all who reside in this castle, in this sacred essence of the Founder's ideal, shall protect all.)

As most, including himself if Hermione hadn't translated it for him earlier, did not know Latin, not a soul spoke. The ritual magic, however, kept attention from wandering, every eye witnessing what was about to happen. 

Picking up the athame, Harry walked first to Theo, standing at the Northern edge of the center circle. Harry led him to the cauldron in the middle of the room, though Hermione noticed even as she chanted that their friend's hand trembled in Harry's own and Harry responded by squeezing it to calm him. It didn't seem to help. When they reached the cauldron and Harry turned to him, Theo's deep blue eyes were filled with emotions: regret, fear, sorrow, a pain Hermione feared she understood and was sure Harry didn't. She saw him start to ask, but Theo shook his head and motioned to the cauldron, holding out his hand.

Theo's hand was over the cauldron, allowing Harry to make a tiny cut on his palm, letting a single drop of blood fall before he moved Theo back to his spot. Next came Hannah, then Ginny who he shared a loving squeeze with and she smiled at him. Anthony was last around the circle and everyone's drop of blood had been added. 

Hermione's chanting was getting louder as the blood fell in until everyone in the room could hear her. ""Sanguis corporum nostrorum, voluntatum intentus, vitae essentia in singulis, Magicae deprecamur, ut aedificium hoc, hos defendat.""   (Blood of our bodies, intent of our wills, the essence of life within each, we beseech thee Magic, to protect this building, these grounds.)

There was shifting, particularly amongst some of the adults and Hermione saw from the corner of her eye, Professor Snape pulling back on Minerva. They knew then. They understood what the ritual called for, but Snape would see to it that Minerva did not interfere. 

Harry called out his part as he brushed Signum seeds into the cauldron for protection. ""Hi propugnatores et omnes qui testantur sacrificium ad maius bonum, ad omnium tutelam, custodes Hogwarts fient.""   (These champions and all who bear witness sacrifice for the greater good, for the protection of all, to become the Guardians of Hogwarts.)

Hermione added the fresh murtlap essence for healing as she stirred the cauldron counterclockwise 8 times. Now it would begin, and they would see what happened. She dipped 2 silver bottles into the potion as Harry did the same, chanting together, ""Utres utres tutantur ut potio intus tutatur. Custodes nostri Hogvartensis moenia sanguinem, alimenta fundent, et omnes hic liberi erunt.""   (These bottles will protect as the potion within protects. Upon the walls of Hogwarts our Guardians will spread their blood, our sustenance, and all will be free here.)

The bottles came out of the potion full but completely clean, as they were meant to. Harry took each of the bottles to one of the Guardians, bidding them to wait until everyone could drink together.

As he did this, Hermione divided the rest of the potion into four containers. Theo and Hermione had worked on connecting them to the bottles for days. 

Harry was back beside her when she finished her task, the four chosen ones clutching their potion bottles, ready to drink.

With a sigh at what they were about to do, Hermione explained, ""From the moment you say these words, the moment you drink these potions, you will be the Guardians of Hogwarts, like new Founders in Magic's eyes. You will repeat after me, then drink."" When they had all nodded at her, Hermione intoned the final words of the ritual. ""Potionem hanc capio, sciens me obligaturum in Hogvartensi et confratribus meis. Sanguis meus in huius castri moenia segetet et defendet. Sic fiat fiat.""   (I take this potion, knowing it binds me to Hogwarts and to my fellow Guardians. My blood, with theirs, will seep into the walls of this castle and protect. So mote it be.)

The four repeated her words dutifully, then drank as they had been instructed. There was an unearthly wind that blew through the Hall now, but the Four stood against it, unmoving. Above the rising gail, Hermione called, ""Ite nunc. Unus desuper, alter ab inferis. Tuam ad moenia pande.""  (Go now. One from above and one from below. Spread your essence to the walls.)

Without consciously knowing what it meant, the four divided. One from a tower with one from the dungeons. Anthony and Hannah. Theo and Ginny, just as Hermione had feared. Trying to push down her feelings, she waved her wand over the containers of potion. ""Imple utres.""  (Fill bottles.)  She watched as each container's potion dropped the amount that would have filled the potion bottles. They would not run out until the containers were empty. It would be enough.

*************

Ginny walked slowly along with Theo. The process of dripping the potion along the walls was slow and tedious, for one thing. But she was also aware that his energy was low. She knew he had at least one more Pepper-Up in his robes, but he seemed intent on saving it. For what, she had no idea.

They were on the East side of the castle, moving from the dungeons up to the top. There had been no discussion. It was just what they both knew they had to do. But the higher they moved, the more Theo seemed to drag. 

""You need to take your other potion,"" she told him. 

""Not yet,"" Theo grimaced. He was panting from the effort of moving, but he was still determined. There was something in his eyes that she didn't understand and he wasn't talking unless she forced him.

The magic wasn't compelling them to be quiet, Ginny had noticed. So she wasn't sure if Theo didn't want to talk to her or if he just physically couldn't. They were almost at the very topmost tower of their side of the castle, a tower she had never seen before. She had noticed that her potion bottle finally felt almost empty. It had been magically full since they drank all of the first bit, no matter how much they splashed out on the walls. 

When they opened the door at the top of the tower, Ginny felt a rush of magic. Inside was a bed and nothing else but a small table to one side. The bed was oddly placed directly in the center of the room, in the middle of an arithmancy circle like she'd never seen, all mixed with runes as it was.

""Finish the walls,"" Theo ground out, looking like he might fall at any moment. 

Ginny did as he suggested, though part of her felt a pull to the bed that she couldn't explain. As she looked over at Theo, she also realized she felt a pull to him personally. What... Shite. She got it now. Suddenly. And her first thought was anger... but then the last drop left the silver bottle and a rush of pure lust surged through her. 

Turning to Theo, she saw how his eyes had darkened and he was staring at her the same way she felt. Pulling a bottle from his robes, Theo downed his other Pepper-Up, suddenly standing straighter. 

His eyes were as perfectly blue as Harry's were green. Ginny expected to be flooded with guilt over that, but she wasn't. The magic had too strong of a hold on her. Moving in sync to the bed, they were soon in the center staring at one another. 

Ginny had no idea when or even how it had happened, but they were both completely nude. She knew she was soaking wet and he was certainly hard and ready. 

There was only a moment to look at him, tall and almost lanky with a cock that matched - long with an average girth. It was going to feel perfect inside her. 

From the moment their lips touched, hands wildly exploring one another, Ginny felt like she was on fire. Within moments of touching, they were both coming, from the sheer relief of touching one another if he was anything like her. 

He spurted onto the bed, mixing with her dripping juices, but somehow the bed wasn't wet. It was like everything was absorbed completely. 

Theo didn't stop. His cock was still hard as a rock when he moved forward, slipping inside her for the first time. There was no need or desire for foreplay. They both wanted him sheathed inside her far more than they wanted anything else. 

When he came, hard, inside her, it felt like a cooling charm burst over her. Over both of them if the look on his face was anything to go by. 

His eyes met hers, and suddenly Theo was scrambling away and off the bed. ""Sorry! I'm so sorry! The Magic... I didn't want to. Shouldn't have wanted to...""

""We have a bond now. The magic made sure we would seal it,"" Ginny pointed out, feeling dazed by what had just happened and the power surging through her. 

""Merlin fuck,"" Theo cursed. ""I don't even like women. Shite. I didn't mean...""

Theo looked so panic-stricken that Ginny had no idea what to say. Then she realized. ""You like men? You're gay?""

Looking away so she couldn't see his face, Theo nodded once.

Ginny waited for him to say something, but he didn't. ""In that case,"" she ventured, ""I'm sorry for what you just had to do.""

Whipping his head back to her, Theo stared for a moment. ""You're not angry? That... that I did that with you when it wasn't... I don't think I want to again.""

""Not without the magic,"" she agreed, then a sudden sinking feeling hit in the pit of her stomach. Harry. ""I don't know you, but I'm not really interested in getting to know you that way either. I have Harry, you see. And... Merlin, I don't know what he's going to think. But I think he'll believe me. We couldn't have known this was going to happen.""

Theo was running his hands through his hair, tugging at it as he flopped onto the ground up against the wall. ""I knew,"" he moaned. ""Knew that the magic, the castle, could demand this kind of sacrifice. I just hoped-""

""What!? You knew?"" With dawning realization, and blossoming fury, she accused, ""You were saving that Pepper-Up because you knew we would have to-""

""Not completely! There was no way to know beforehand what would happen. We wrote this ritual ourselves. But I knew enough about these kinds of rituals to see it as likely.""

""Why didn't you tell the rest of us?"" she demanded. 

""We barely talked Kingsley and McGonagall into the drops of blood. If they had known there was even a tiny chance of fertility magic, they would have left the castle unprotected rather than try it. I had hoped it wouldn't be like this.""

""Like what? That you had to fuck a girl... fuck me when you didn't want to?

""Of course I bloody well didn't want to fuck someone I didn't want who doesn't want me either. I think we're both allowed to be upset about that. Merlin, what kind of question is that?"" Theo demanded.

They sat in silence for a moment, both breathing hard as they tried to calm themselves. 

Like lightning striking, Ginny had a sudden realization. ""You knew this was going to happen. And you had to have known you were going to be Slytherin's pick. Who was it you had hoped for?""

""What? Theo asked. ""The castle had to be protected. What are you-""

""Liar,"" Ginny called him out. ""You knew it would happen. And you wanted it. Just not with me.""

Theo had gone nearly white. ""No! I...""

Thinking aloud, Ginny went over everything. ""You're gay, so it would have been a man. Someone you could have had a reasonable expectation it might be. Everyone expected... Harry. You wanted it to be Harry."" She felt her jaw drop. That was a twist.

With his head in his hands, elbows propped on his knees, Theo said, ""I'm sorry. I truly did not want this, even with him. Even if I do... like him. I didn't mean to feel that way about him and I don't want to take him from you.""

""Well, as it turns out, you didn't,"" Ginny snapped, sliding down the wall to sit next to him despite her anger. It was already melting into pity, even if she couldn't let it go without one more jab. ""You took me from him."" 

Theo gasped in an anguished way. ""I didn't want... I would never have wanted to take anyone or anything from him. I hate that it was me. I hate that I knew it could turn out like this. I'm so bloody sorry.""

""On the bright side, if it hadn't been you, it would have been Severus. I can't imagine that going over better,"" Ginny said, bumping him with her elbow. 

A strangled laugh escaped him. ""That's one way to look at this mess, I guess.""

I am SO sorry for how long this chapter took. First, after the climactic ritual, I had a hard time with what exactly had to happen in the aftermath. Then all my alphas have had a terrible time with life lately and it has taken a while for one of them to be free enough to guide me.

But thank you so much StarGirlPotter for alpha/beta-ing this thing and talking me through some of the future directions this will go.

Sunday, June 14th; morning

""She wasn't there!"" Draco exclaimed, tugging at his hair. ""I waited at the fountain and she wasn't there. What do I do?""

Blaise groaned, wishing Draco would just go away if he ignored him. Charlie was still only half conscious and Blaise would prefer to keep him that way - cocooned safely in his arms in the quiet of their secret bedroom.

""Blaise, get up! Didn't you hear me?""

""Bloody hell, mate. I heard you. The whole Manor probably heard you.""

Draco had the grace to look worried for a split second before realization dawned on him, and quickly, his worry was replaced by annoyance. ""That's not how sound works in here and you know it.""

He wasn't wrong. Blaise thanked Merlin it was true that the secret room kept its sound contained. Still. ""You're waking my patient.""

""You mean I'm waking your boyfriend, and you wanted to snuggle a while longer,"" Draco sneered before standing up and moving to pace. Blaise just knew he was about to make a demand for help. ""I need you.""

""To do what?"" Blaise asked.

Draco stopped his pacing and threaded his hands into his hair, but whether it was in fear or annoyance, Blaise was uncertain. All he knew was that Draco really did look like he might pull his own hair out. ""To... I don't know. Put me back to sleep in case she-""

""No,"" Blaise said flatly. ""If she didn't appear all night, they must have given her Dreamless, and she was too tired to come out from under it. You know she's at Hogwarts and safe. No Death Eaters are there. Aside from the spell on Ron, I don't think they even have a spy.""

Blaise watched as Draco moved to the nearby armchair, pinched his nose, and tried to calm himself down. ""Okay. She's okay. Just. She pulled on my magic again last night. I left you alone because you were already in bed and... well I didn't know how conscious lover boy might be, so-""

""Not conscious enough to even think about anything like that,"" Blaise growled, not appreciating the insinuation. They had still done nothing further than kiss and sleep next to one another. Which was fine, but he didn't appreciate Draco's reminder of his former playboy ways and how much he, in fact, would like more. ""And our... my relationship is none of your business.""

Draco looked at him oddly, but Blaise honestly didn't know if it was enough of a relationship to say ""our."" He knew how he felt, but wasn't sure, really, if Charlie returned it to the degree he wanted him to, especially now that he wasn't dependent on Blaise anymore. Well, when he didn't run his stupid arse straight into crossfire.

Grumbling, Blaise pulled himself from the bed, tucking the sheets around Charlie so as not to wake him. 

""Fine, Draco. Tell me about this different magic pull,"" he said as he stumbled toward the kitchen area. He was grateful when Draco handed him a cup of tea, already made to his liking. 

""It's... this wasn't like she needed magic in the moment. It was more like a building need and she took a trickle of my magic.""

""Did she ask for it somehow like she said she would?"" Blaise asked. 

""No,"" Draco said, a little bitterly, Blaise thought. ""But it definitely felt different. Old. Deep. Something... just different from an emergency.""

Blaise's eyes opened wide. ""They've got Theo on their side, and probably working with Granger. Do you think they came up with some kind of ritual?""

""Something to protect them there. I can see it. That would be one hell of a ritual to protect all of Hogwarts, though,"" Draco said.

""Your wife is one hell of a woman and the kind of pull you describe makes sense with the building of magic that happens in a ritual. What are you feeling from her now?""

Draco paused for a moment. ""Guilt. Lots of it.""

""So a ritual that required some things she didn't like,"" Blaise assumed.

""Sounds that way,"" Charlie said, wavering slightly where he stood by the door of their bedroom. ""Did you really think I was going to just lay there while the two of you talked about this? I can't believe she didn't come last night so you could hear what happened.""

Charlie began making his way to the kitchen, clearly intent on breakfast. ""You should sit and let me make-"" Blaise began.

""And have it all burnt to hell?"" Charlie said with a grin, ""No thanks.""

Gritting his teeth a little, Blaise asked, ""What are you going to make?""

""Omelets if you'll dice the veggies and things,"" he replied. Blaise had never been so grateful for the cold box that magically pulled food from somewhere else in the Manor. Blaise was quickly preparing ingredients while Charlie set everything up at the stove. Draco watched the two of them with a small smile that he hid behind his teacup and an eyeroll if one of them looked at him. 

It was... domestic and wonderful in a way Blaise couldn't quite describe. When Charlie reached around him for some of the things he had already diced, effectively surrounding him with his strong body, it took everything Blaise had not to turn and kiss him. Charlie's smirk said he knew it, too. If only it could always be like this.

***********

Professor McGonagall's Scottish brogue was far more easily heard than usual as she yelled, ""I don't care that she's been unconscious when she's pulled a stunt like this!""

Madam Pomfrey looked displeased, but stepped aside, much to Hermione's horror. She had only just woken and still didn't remember what had happened but it appeared that she had, again, magically exhausted herself. At least Harry was in the next bed, so it appeared he had fared no better.

""I see you're awake, Lady Malfoy!"" Professor McGonagall practically spat her name and title. ""Did you think it would be a good idea to start a huge ritual with ancient magic without telling us what would happen? Do you think that was the right thing to do?""

Hermione winced. She had known it wasn't. But she wasn't backing down now. ""You wouldn't have agreed if you knew,"" she told her raging Headmistress. ""And this isn't negotiable.""

Professor McGonagall looked like she might have an apoplectic fit. ""You do not get to decide that!""

""But I did,"" Hermione fired back. ""Someone had to decide it. You've sat here for a month and a half with the walls crumbling around your 'stronghold.' Theo and I researched extensively. This was the only way to bring the level of protection needed.""

""Yet you say it won't protect the castle somehow? That there needs to be something more?"" Professor McGonagall demanded.

""It won't. The castle is sentient. You know that. But the battle damaged it badly. If you want it to remain standing and maintain its integrity, there must be a further ritual.""

""This one required sex bonding! What will the next-""

""Sex bonding?"" Harry asked, sitting up wearily from his bed.

Professor McGonagall whirled to stare at Harry. Slowly turning back to Hermione, she leveled her most disgusted look so far. ""You brought Harry Potter into a ritual, had him chant the things that bound them, and didn't tell him what it would do,"" she hissed.

""We weren't sure-"" Hermione defended.

""You enacted a ritual in my castle and you weren't sure what it would require!?"" Professor McGonagall was only getting angrier. ""What will the next one be - sacrificing someone? It won't happen on my watch.""

""Minerva,"" a frail voice called out. Madam Pomfrey rushed to Mrs. Weasley's side, trying to push her down from the way she was struggling to sit up. ""Leave me be, Poppy. It will be me, Minerva. You know you're right. That ritual will want more sex magic, and it will want sacrifice.""

""And we're not about to agree to such foul magic-"" Professor McGonagall began.

""But you are, dear,"" Mrs. Weasley said. ""Because we need to win this war for the future.""

""There will be another way,"" the professor insisted, tears rolling down her cheeks.

Mrs. Weasley nodded sagely. ""Yes, we could abandon the castle before it falls.""

""We will not-"" Professor McGonagall started.

""Then we will accept the requirements of the rituals,"" Hermione said. Her voice was soft, but it carried weight. Somehow she was still channeling magic.

""And, though no one here will tell my family a word of this,"" Mrs. Weasley began, ""I will be the one in the ritual. I can't protect my children anymore from this body, but I can protect all the kids from inside Hogwarts' walls.""

""Mrs. Weasley, that's... it would solve a huge problem, but... we don't know yet when..."" Hermione trailed off, choking back tears. She couldn't make herself say that Molly might die before the ritual.

""I'll hold on until it's time. If we could, I would like it if Arthur and I could participate in the other part of the magic, too. Haven't done a ritual like that since before Bill,"" Mrs. Weasley murmured, falling back on the bed, energy spent.

Professor McGonagall had tears rolling down her cheeks now as she watched the matriarch fall quickly into sleep. The next ritual would need to be soon, Hermione knew, if Mrs. Weasley was truly to sacrifice herself. Hermione felt the tears on her own cheeks.

Harry sniffled, but took a deep breath and asked, ""You said sex magic? Who?""

""Your ex-girlfriend, that's who,"" Professor McGonagall snapped.

""I don't have a-"" Harry cut himself off, eyes going wide as Ginny burst into the ward. 

************

Seeing Harry sitting up in bed staring at her put Ginny's heart instantly in her throat, especially in combination with the dark looks Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall wore and Hermione's apologetic one. If it weren't for the fact that Ginny and Theo had more than talked through this and she knew he had been far more aware of the likelihood of sex magic than Hermione, Ginny had to admit she would be angry with her friend.

She could hear Theo's soft step behind her. Ginny wasn't looking at him, but she knew from the bond between them that he was in a state of absolute misery. He couldn't hide it from her and that seemed to make things much worse for him. Of course, she was certain he felt her anger and guilt as well. 

Harry rolled off the infirmary bed suddenly and stumbled across the floor, putting himself between Ginny and the rest of the room's occupants except Theo behind her. Harry took her hand and said, ""I don't have an ex-girlfriend because Ginny and I are still together.""

""Maybe you should hear what she has to say for herself before you decide that,"" Professor McGonagall snapped in irritation.

""Maybe they should have this conversation alone,"" Hermione suggested softly, her voice sounding stuffy like she might cry.

""Alone, but Hermione and Theo, please stay,"" Harry said decisively. Ginny saw Hermione shrink into her blankets. She wished she had blankets to shrink into as well, but at least she had Harry's warm hand wrapped around her own - for now.

Madam Pomfrey grumbled, ""I suppose you won't rest until you've had your talk, so get to it. Minerva, come with me. I need some help tending..."" And they were gone, Pomfrey's voice to low to be heard as they moved away.

Hermione cast a quick Muffliato around them.

""Now, why is McGonagall so sure we're not together?"" Harry asked patiently, taking her other hand in his. 

Ginny tried not to notice that both Hermione and Theo had winced. Hermione looked like she was dying to enter the conversation but Ginny gave her a subtle look to say no. This was her own mess and she would handle it.

""Harry, the ritual last night... it invoked... well, you know there was blood magic involved, but also-""

""Sex magic,"" Theo broke in, his voice sounding almost broken. 

""Yes,"" Ginny agreed irritably. ""We had to... it wasn't a choice really once we agreed to the ritual. I didn't realize that was part of it, but we... I had sex with Theo.""

""I know,"" Harry said simply. When they all stared at him, he gave all three of them an irritated look. ""I'm not stupid. Mione, Theo - you two should know at least that I was there for a lot of your conversations when you were making this ritual. Quite honestly, I assumed that I was going to be the one chosen by the castle's magic. I had been trying to figure out what I was going to say when the castle chose me, but then it just, well, didn't.""

""I didn't really think you were paying much attention,"" Hermione admitted.

""A lot of it went over my head, but... I'm a 17-year-old bloke. The word 'sex' tends to catch my attention, so I knew it was a possibility. When I heard the ritual phrasing you chose, I assumed Theo's theory was right,"" Harry explained. 

Ginny felt her jaw drop. ""Harry James Potter,"" she intoned, ""Are you saying you knew you were sending me to have sex with Theo and you were just... okay with it?""

""No. I'm not okay. But neither are you. Or Theo by the look of him. I hate that it was two people I care about,"" Harry said, not noticing how Theo's cheeks flushed at those words, ""But what was done had to be done for everyone's safety. And the magic chose you.""

""Wait,"" Hermione interrupted. ""You seemed confused about all this when Professor McGonagall was talking about... um... talking earlier.""  

Ginny wondered at that pause and backtracking, but there wasn't time to question it. Harry raised an eyebrow and said, ""I thought we were all pretending we had no idea this was really going to happen, right? So the grown-ups don't lock us all away and say we can't go on with the next necessary ritual?""

Hermione's mouth was hanging open. Theo looked barely less stunned. Ginny threw herself into Harry's arms and kissed him. It felt strange, knowing what she had just done, to be back with Harry. She felt the bond with Theo tighten, sensing his emotions of jealousy and something suspiciously like despair. 

Without meaning to, Ginny found herself breaking away from Harry and beckoning Theo closer. She felt Harry stiffen beside her. ""I can't not feel him,"" she whispered, to Harry, but also a little bit to herself. ""We're hurting him like this.""

Theo, though. He didn't come closer. He started to back toward the door instead, his distress so strong through their bond that Ginny nearly ran for it herself. Instead, when Theo turned to rush out the door, she hit him in the back with a Petrificus Totalis. 

""I'm sorry, Theo,"" Harry said tightly. ""I didn't... don't mean to hurt you, but I'm not giving her up entirely.""

Ginny laughed and, despite the fear and horror in Theo's eyes and pouring through the bond, she said it. ""Harry, I don't think I'm the one he's upset about.""

Even through the petrification, Theo groaned, the frantic message through their bond one of a repeated plea. ""No, don't do this. Don't ruin everything."" Ginny could see the words written in his eyes.

But she knew Harry. And she knew there was a part of himself that never fit quite right with her. Or maybe not with just her. Sighing at the feelings from Theo, Ginny shook her head. ""Harry, you wouldn't be able to tell if someone liked you if they flat out told you.""

There was a pause in the room as it seemed like all the air had been sucked out, but Hermione broke the silence. ""I'm fairly certain people have flat out told him they liked him and he still didn't realize it. I remember him coming to me when Cho asked him out years ago trying to figure out why she was asking about the DA meeting.""

Hermione's attempt to break the awkwardness didn't quite work in the way she had expected it to. The silence persevered until an exasperated Harry said, ""You mean like the way Theo likes me? Because even I'm not that oblivious. Not that he's one to talk! I don't think he's noticed how I feel at all,"" Harry complained.

Ginny's hands moved on their own, automatically flying in fists to her hips. ""What do you mean 'how you feel,' Harry Potter? When were you going to mention to me that you had your eyes on someone else?"" Ginny demanded, ignoring the thought in the back of her mind that this was a completely unfair reaction from her and that Harry's awareness made everything much better and easier.

Harry shrugged. ""When we had time to talk here. I was hoping it wouldn't mean a break up, but I was nervous about it, so I hadn't worked up the nerve yet and then you were chosen and we had other things to think about because what if this happened, and..."" 

Harry trailed off, shaking his head before he walked over to where Theo lay, still petrified on the floor. ""If I let you out of her spell, will you stay and talk instead of running?"" Harry asked. His voice was curious more than accusatory. 

Of course Theo couldn't actually answer, but Harry seemed to believe in him. Ginny wasn't so sure, feeling his turbulent emotions as he did.

The moment Harry broke the spell, Theo scrambled into a position where he looked closed in on himself. Ginny felt instant regret for forcing this conversation on him. It wasn't what they had discussed. Harry just... he hadn't reacted at all as they had expected and it made Ginny overly optimistic about this all working out easily. Too easily, perhaps.

A look of nervousness came over Harry as he ran his hand through his unruly hair. ""I needed to talk to Ginny first,"" he told the other boy. ""And... I mean, I wasn't completely sure how you felt.""

""I... you don't have to do this to be with her, Harry. I won't... I would never stand in your way,"" Theo said, his voice quiet. Ginny could feel something akin to terror slamming in waves through the bond. Merlin, she hoped there was some way to mask all this.

""This isn't about Ginny and I, Theo,"" Harry told him. ""This is about you and I.""

""And us as a trio,"" Ginny agreed.

""A triad,"" Hermione corrected, reminding them all yet again that she was still there.

Ginny looked at her for a moment, feeling the gravity of that declaration, then nodded. ""A triad. There hasn't been one around in quite some time, but triads are said to be very powerful. We need power. And we need each other.

""But that still doesn't mean Harry should be forced to be with me when-"" Theo was cut off by Harry's mouth against his. 

The kiss lacked finesse, more of a crash and then raw passion, but it looked like Harry was proving his point now in a way Theo never would have believed through words. Ginny found herself smiling, and Hermione returned it tentatively, then more broadly as the boy's enthusiasm grew. 

Eventually, Ginny hooked her arm through Hermione's and the two girls quietly left the hospital wing, giggling as soon as the door closed. 

""Ginny, I'm so sorry,"" Hermione started.

""Don't you dare,"" she told her. ""I'm happy for this, for them, and for me. But there is a price.""

""Anything, Ginny,"" Hermione told her seriously.

""I was hoping you would say that,"" Ginny said with a grin. ""You're listening to all the details."" She cackled when Hermione groaned.

**********

He was almost as angry as the time Remus... well, she wouldn't think about that. But Tonks was certainly aware that this was one of those times no one wanted to be noticed by the Dark Lord. 

Which is why it filled her with a sick glee when Rowle was brought before his lord and master to be torn apart. She watched from her spot kneeling on the floor as the Dark Lord began with a few small Crucios. ""You are supposed to get us information that is correct.""

""My Lord, I tried!"" he swore. ""I heard what they were planning. But somehow... there has to be a spy here somewhere. Someone who knew what was going to happen and warned them.""

""Let me guess - you're going to blame Bellatrix's boy toy somehow. You think he's in the walls watching us since we can't catch him? Crucio.""

When that one ended, Rowle had blood and spit running down his chin. He must have bitten his tongue. Good. Maybe he would bite it out and he wouldn't be able to run them information anymore. Tonks knew it was a twisted thought, but she didn't care anymore. Anything that hurt him. 

""N-no, my Lord. I think... everyone was here listening when I reported it to you. It could be anyone.""

Tonks thought he was going to torture Rowle again, but Voldy surprised her. He looked contemplative.

""From now on, you report directly to me and only me. My army will be told only the parts they need to know so that we know exactly where the leak came from if it happens again,"" he stated, glaring around at all those assembled. 

""I... I'm sorry, my Lord, but there may not be much to tell. Potter's Mudblood made it into the castle. She seemed to know all about my link with him and how the spell works. She had them isolate him.""

""Isolate him?"" Voldemort growled.

""Yes, my lord. In a room completely alone at first and now... he's basically being held captive with two others,"" Rowle explained.

""Others?""

""They were two of our recruits. The reports said they were captured, but they seem quite happy to be with a Weasley. Magenta Brown, especially. Astoria Greengrass is the other.""

""Greengrass,"" Voldemort muttered, then looked up, his red eyes fiercely glowing. ""There is another sister, yes?"" His question was aimed all around, though his eyes stopped on the father of the Greengrass girls.

""Yes, my Lord,"" Sebastian Greengrass answered, ""useless, both of them.""

""I'm so happy you have no attachment to them as they will both be dead before long,"" Voldemort said angrily. ""Someone fetch the Greengrass girl who is still here. Daphne, isn't it? The other will pay when we take down the castle. Bring in the new prisoner as well.""

""Now, why was the Mudblood at the castle if she hasn't been before? You never mentioned why she and Potter were going to be there,"" Voldemort said, glaring down at Rowle. When he didn't answer immediately, he was hit with another Crucio.

""Please, my Lord. It was a ritual. Something the Mudblood devised, we thought,"" Rowle rushed out.

""Thought before? What do you think now?""

A Death Eater Tonks didn't know stepped forward. ""It appears it was the Nott boy, the one we thought dead or captured.""

""Is this true, Theodore!?"" Voldemort yelled.

""My Lord, the senior Nott is among the injured. He brought in the prisoner, if you recall. The story is that he attempted to kill his son, but the prisoner and Harry Potter stopped him, saving the son,"" the man said.

""But leaving one of their own behind, how very unlike them,"" the Dark Lord mused.

""Well, he's not exactly one of their own either,"" the man hedged. 

Tonks didn't recognize the bloodied boy they brought forward, but he was definitely, despite his bulk, still just a child.

""Goyle!"" Voldemort shouted. 

A huge bulk of a man shuffled forward, glancing fearfully toward the boy who was clearly his own. Unlike Greengrass, this father seemed concerned about the fate of his child.

""What is the meaning of this? Your child is one of them now?"" 

""I'm sorry, my Lord,"" Goyle debased himself on the floor. ""Gregory was always easily led astray. If the Nott boy went over to their side, I'm certain Greg was just following-""

He cut off as Voldemort Crucioed him mercilessly. 

""We do not blame others for our inadequacies,"" Voldemort spat. ""How many of your children are traitors to the blood?"" he asked loudly.

No one spoke, but that only seemed to enrage him further. Fortunately for the elder Goyle, a girl was dragged in at that moment. Tonks had seen her before - lovely, long blond hair, trim figure. A perfect, pureblood princess. But now her dress was torn and she had a bruise blossoming across her cheek. Tonks had a sinking feeling she would look far worse than that by the end of the night. She was another child. The same age as Harry and them, by the look of her.

""Ah... Miss Greengrass. So nice of you to join us,"" the Dark Lord said menacingly. He rose and walked down from his dais, slowly circling the girl. ""Everyone will enjoy you very much tonight.""

The girl immediately started screaming obscenities at him. Voldemort actually strode forward and slapped her before silencing the child. ""You have your sister to thank for your demise,"" he told her with a sinister grin.

Tonks gasped along with everyone else when the girl spit in his face. The Dark Lord drew back, furious. 

""Avada Kedavra!"" he screamed, but instead of the girl, it was her father who dropped at the end of his spell. There was a shocked silence before the girl tried to scream again staring at her father while tears streamed down her cheeks, but found herself still silenced. 

""Did you think you could enrage me and escape your fate, Daphne?"" Voldemort taunted.

Tonks wanted to throw up, knowing what awful things they would do to the poor girl. While her memories were spotty since arriving, he had left her with more than enough to know the kind of horror this Daphne would face. And they would likely kill her when they were done. If not, she would wish they had.

""Don't worry,"" Voldemort continued, looking over at the other prisoner with a sickening grin. ""You won't be alone. This one can be used as well. If you're lucky, we might not even kill the two of you. Might have my healer boy fix you so you can entertain us another night.""

His crowd cheered, even though Tonks noticed there were some faces who looked sickened even as they clapped. She catalogued who looked disturbed by two more of their children being sacrificed to his most depraved minions. Only then did she spare herself the energy to shudder at the thought of Blaise patching these kids up so that the same could be done to them again. 

""My Lord,"" the man, Goyle, begged for attention, down on his needs. ""Please, he's my only child.""

""And a blood traitor. Take another heir. Or make one. This one is worth less than the dirt we walk on.""

""Yes, my Lord,"" Goyle said, but his voice was broken as he looked at his son. The boy was barely conscious. Tonks wondered if they would make Blaise give him something for awareness before the ""festivities"" began.

She didn't have to wait long since it was Voldemort's next command. By the time Blaise arrived with potions in hand, Dolohov and his ilk had already surrounded both the Goyle boy and Daphne Greengrass. 

Blaise was stoic, but even from so far back, Tonks could see the tremble in his hand as he approached the boy.

""Blaise, no, please,"" the young Goyle begged. ""Don't do this to me.""

Saying nothing, Blaise tipped the potion bottle up to the other boy's lips. Sometimes she forgot that he, too, was really just a kid. Tonks wondered if they had known one another well. Judging by how rigid Blaise was standing, they had. 

She wasn't sure what potion he had been told to give Daphne, but he looked no more happy about it. At least whatever words she was trying to say to him couldn't be heard. But then, for Blaise that might make it even worse. Tonks wasn't sure.

Rowle suddenly was beside her, grabbing her and draggin backward, apparently intending to get out of there before the night's festivities were further underway. That was fine by Tonks. What happened next was not anything she wanted to see.

""Leaving so soon, my faithful servant?"" The Dark Lord's voice followed them. 

Tonks felt Rowle's hand on her upper arm stiffen just before he turned back. ""Yes, my Lord. I wanted to check the curse bond again and see if there is anything new happening. I hope that someone will put the Mudblood in her place and get him out of the room they're keeping him in.""

""So curious that they've locked up one of their own. If we could curse others, they would cut off their own feet before they would let them wander about and give away their secrets.""

Shuffling his feet a bit, Rowle answered, ""It was a difficult spell to master, my Lord, but perhaps Dolohov can keep improving it and make it easier for others.""

""Indeed. I will speak to him about it,"" Voldemort hissed, his eyes gleaming with what could only be happiness at the thought of more people cursed. ""Do you have anything else of interest to report?""

""One more thing, yes."" Rowle seemed to steel himself before saying, ""Severus Snape is alive.""

Warning: Minor Character Death, somewhat graphic

I'm back! Finally. I had terrible writer's block for a while there, but I have a plan moving forward now! I'm not promising an exact update schedule at the moment, but I will say I'm already working on the next chapter. 

Thank you to my alpha, MistressLynn, and beta highlyintelligentblonde.

 

I still don't own Harry Potter.

Sun, June 14th, night

Harry crawled into bed next to Ginny, still shocked by her family's attitude now. They had gone from glaring and refusing to let him near Ginny at ""inappropriate times"" to whole-heartedly condoning the two of them sleeping together... with Theo. It was baffling.

Some part of Harry was well aware of why the Weasley men had suddenly stopped guarding Ginny so fiercely. From him, at least. But seeing Theo, looking so worried beside the bed, Harry couldn't imagine anything more ridiculous than thinking Ginny needed protecting from him. 

From anyone for that matter. Ginny could hold her own just fine without Harry's help or anyone else's.

But to imply that Theo was a threat -- especially after the two of them had bonded to each other and to Hogwarts -- was ludicrous. 

Still, Harry couldn't complain when it meant that the three of them were preparing for a night in bed together. Now if he could just convince Theo there was no reason for him to hover off to the side like that.

""Are you getting in?"" Harry asked, holding the blanket open beside himself. 

Theo's eyes grew round for a moment before he rolled his eyes. ""Maybe I wanted to sleep next to her.""

Ginny snorted indelicately at the suggestion. ""Then I guess you would have to be in the middle,"" she commented. ""Because Merlin knows this git wants to snuggle you.""

Going red, Theo couldn't seem to come up with a thing to say to that.

""Come on,"" Harry coaxed. ""I won't bite.""

""Unless you want him to,"" Ginny added playfully. 

Harry rolled his eyes. He loved Ginny, including how fun she was, but Theo was far too uncertain right now to appreciate it. Of course, when he wasn't so uncertain and both of them were back in full form, Ginny and Theo were going to overwhelm him with their sarcasm and wit. Harry smiled to himself. He could be very okay with that. Especially since it would mean they were both happy.

As happy as people could be in the middle of a war, at least.

Finally, Theo moved toward the bed. He was shaking slightly as he slid in next to Harry. They were all three dressed in pajamas. Harry didn't imagine anything was going to happen between any of them except maybe the snuggles Ginny had mentioned. 

Much as Harry might want more, he didn't want it tonight.

This night was about getting comfortable together and convincing Theo, and to a lesser degree Ginny, that he really was okay -- and even enthusiastic -- about this.

Before things could get too awkward, Ginny declared, ""I'm holding you, Harry. I suggest you let Harry hold you, Theo, but that's up to you two."" Without further adieu, she slid her body against Harry, turning him so that he was facing Theo with her wrapped around his back and her arms firmly around his waist. 

Harry looked at the young man beside him and raised an eyebrow in silent challenge. 

Theo blinked his gorgeous blue eyes at Harry then shook his head. ""Just remember you asked for this,"" he said as he moved closer, settling his body alongside Harry's. 

Now that it had happened, Harry was surprised by how forward Theo was. Despite their kiss earlier in the day and the talk they had where Harry reassured Theo that he wasn't angry about what he had done with Ginny, Theo had been almost timid around him.

Pressing his body against Harry, their noses almost touching, wasn't what Harry had thought Theo was going to do, but he certainly wasn't complaining. A broad smile stole across his face as Harry settled in between the two people he had come to love. 

There were still others who were important to him, but Harry knew somehow that Theo and Ginny were the ones he was meant to spend his life with. For the first time since Sirius died, Harry felt like he had the family he was meant to have. 

*************

""Why weren't you here last night?"" Draco demanded when she stepped into the clearing.

Hermione smiled at him, finding his ire somehow endearing as she watched him flipping his platinum hair out of his eyes in agitation. ""I was exhausted and they gave me Dreamless Sleep.""

Gritting his teeth, Draco asked, ""What exhausted you? You took my magic again, but this felt different.""

""I... I did?"" she asked, knowing her face had fallen. Why could she never make it work to ask instead of just taking? Merlin, she didn't even know she was doing it.

Pacing toward her, Draco grabbed her upper arms and pulled her into a rough embrace. ""You did, but I don't care. Are you okay? What happened?""

""There was a ritual--""

""So you knew this was going to happen?"" he asked, stepping away and crossing his arms, trying to hide... hurt? Was he in pain? If it had been anyone else, she would have said she hurt their feelings, but obviously that couldn't be the problem with him.

""I did,"" she admitted, suddenly feeling guilty about it. If she had known she would be taking his magic, she could have warned him. ""I didn't know it would take your--""

""Well now you know,"" he said gruffly, cramming his hands in the pockets of his trousers. ""So if you're going to do anymore rituals,"" he sneered, ""you could let me know first.""

Hermione stared at him for a few moments, waiting to feel angry or at least irritated. She didn't. And her previous sense of self-preservation that had cautioned her not to tell him anything about what they were doing was absent as well.

""There will be another, a bigger one, but it will be a little while. A month, maybe more,"" Hermione told him quietly.

Draco looked taken aback. ""Bigger than this? You won't have enough magic even if you pull everything I have, too.""

""There are more people adding their magic to that one."" Hermione wasn't sure why she suddenly felt defensive. 

""What in Merlin's name are you trying to do? What did you do last night?"" he asked, sinking down onto the fountain edge.

She stood in front of him and started to tell him, then paused. ""You've said you don't want to know. I don't think this is such sensitive information that you can't know it. It's just hard to tell what--""

""Don't. If it's something important, I can't know it,"" Draco said, though his frustration was a living thing.

""What if it's something--""

""No. Nothing important,"" he commanded.

Huffing, Hermione said, ""I thought you were a master Occlumens.""

""I am,"" Draco said, huffing right back, ""but anyone can crack. And I think I've said this before -- he only needs me barely alive so that my blood is inside these wards. I don't think he would hesitate to torture me into insanity for information if he knew we could do this.""

""But you convinced him you knew nothing about where I had gone,"" Hermione said.

Draco nodded, but looked worried. ""I just don't trust that he won't find out somewhere. He's the bloody Dark Lord, Hermione. You have no idea what he's capable of.""

She smiled down at him when he used her name. Somehow hearing it spill from his lips always put her in a better mood.

Instinctively, she stepped forward so that she stood between his legs, pulling his head against her body and running her hands through his hair. Hermione could hear his sigh, so much like relief, as she began running her fingers through it. 

""Okay,"" she said, ""I won't tell you anything, but... I feel awful about it. About... What if I'm keeping secrets I feel you should know?""

Draco almost moaned when he spoke, ""If it affects the safety of someone here, you can tell me so I can protect them. Otherwise, I refuse to know, Granger."" Despite switching back to calling her ""Granger,"" he was nuzzling into her like a cat, his arms wrapping around her waist as though they had a mind of their own.

Hermione dropped slowly to her knees, sliding down until her head was below his. Draco's hands moved into her hair now and pulled her closer, his head bending down, pillowed lips pressing to hers and bringing a soft sigh from her.

""Need this. Need you,"" he whispered between kisses that Hermione fervently returned.

Draco pulled her up against him, rearranging the two of them until she was straddling his lap, her core pressed against the hard length she could feel between them. Hermione whimpered with a burning need she had no memory of ever feeling before, though her body rocked against him as though she knew exactly what to do.

""Sweet Merlin, it's been so long,"" Draco said softly.

For a moment, Hermione continued the path she had been kissing up his neck to his ear, as her fingers toyed at the hem of his shirt, but then the words caught up with her -- the words and everything they meant.

She jerked her head back, suddenly filled with the anger and frustration that threatened to overwhelm her anytime she thought about everything she couldn't remember. 

That were entirely Draco's fault.

Hermione pushed away from him even as he whimpered a protest. Her own body protested as well, but she dragged herself away from him, standing and backing away.

""What--""

""Sometimes I forget that you know everything that happened when I don't get to have those memories,"" she said coldly. Hermione knew she felt better, less magically exhausted, when she had touched him and spent time together... and logic would suggest that the more they did, the greater the effect. But she wasn't going to explore that possibility when he had treated her so poorly.

Draco's eyes were dazed at first from their kisses. Then as they sharpened, she saw pain there that almost made her regret pulling away from him. ""Hermione, I...""

As he tried to keep speaking, he began to fade away, the real world apparently calling, leaving Hermione angry, frustrated, and yes, more than a little turned on despite it all.

************

Mon, June 15th

The lights in the infirmary didn't come on until after four in the morning. Charlie wanted to run straight out and see what had kept Blaise all night, but he knew it was too dangerous. 

Cautiously, he crept first out of the secret room, into the lab. It was still dark inside, odd since Blaise usually ran straight in for potions. Moving silently toward the door, he was confused at the lack of sound. Blaise had never been so late before without either stumbling straight into bed or clamoring around the infirmary trying desperately to save a life or ten.

When Charlie listened closely, he heard a strangled sound that made him rush into the infirmary, danger be damned.

A quick glance showed him a new patient, and the heartbroken sounds of Blaise sobbing were just on the other side. Something horrible must have...

Charlie almost stopped, the mutilation was so horrific. The person was naked, of course, but there was so much blood and their limbs sat at odd angles covering the parts that would have told for sure if the body was even male or female. He thought it was probably a woman based on general size, but he couldn't be sure. Were they even still alive? But if they weren't, why had Blaise brought them here? 

""Blaise... What do I do? Can we... is there anything we can do?"" Charlie asked, his voice soft but urgent as he approached. He didn't understand why Blaise wasn't working on the person. Unless it was already too late, but Charlie swore he had seen a tremor of movement.

He barely recognized the voice that answered. ""We can kill her so she doesn't have to suffer anymore."" Then the sobbing began again.

As appalling as the thought was that the poor girl was alive, Charlie made his way around the bed. His goal was Blaise, crumpled on the floor next to it, sobbing so hard he couldn't get enough air to breathe.

Charlie knelt next to him, placing his hand on Blaise's. Swallowing hard at what he knew he needed to offer, he asked, ""Do you need me to do it?"" 

""She... I can't... I already gave her three pain potions. So she... she can't feel anything while she bleeds out. She's passed out from blood loss already. It won't be long. But if we... If we do anything to help the process, they'll be able to detect it. I should do it anyway, let them torture me that much more. Who cares? But I can't. Charlie, how do I kill someone I care about? Daphne... she... we grew up together. They already killed Greg. And part of me wants to save her. I could. She doesn't have to die. But they would do it again tomorrow and the next day and keep on and it never ends..."" Blaise babbled at him, desperate for something, for some kind of absolution maybe, or a solution to this new horror.

Understanding the situation a little better, Charlie lifted Blaise off the floor to look him over. Blaise was not physically harmed as far as he could tell which was a relief. So this was only the mental anguish. Not that it wasn't more than bad enough, but he could have been hurt or tortured already on top of it. 

Blaise just buried his face in Charlie's neck and cried. For what felt like hours, all Charlie could do was hold him and hope he would calm. When he had cried himself to sleep, Charlie scooped him up, glancing dubiously at the bed again, and carried Blaise into the secret room and their bedroom there. 

Charlie knew he shouldn't think of it as theirs when his place was down in the training camp and he was due to go back to it today, but the secret room was as close to a home as he had right now. Someone needed to see to Daphne, but this close to dawn, he couldn't do it. All he could do was have Draco check. Only, if Blaise grew up with the girl, then so did Draco. Charlie's heart hurt for them both, but something had to be done.

When he walked into Draco's room, the blond was tossing and turning, shaking his head vigorously in his sleep as though telling someone no. He shouldn't mind being woken from whatever bad dream he was having. Not wanting to startle him too much when he already seemed volatile, Charlie gently shook the young man awake.

""No!"" Draco shouted at him when he came fully out of it. ""No! I have to go back! I need to explain to her--""

""Rose Garden?"" Charlie asked, feeling bad that he had interrupted. ""I thought you were having a nightmare and--""

""You can't just wake me up because of what I'm doing in my sleep!"" Draco snapped. ""It's too important--""

""This is important,"" Charlie insisted, grimacing at how gruesome this task was.

""Something happened?"" Draco said, switching gears instantly as he started to scramble out of bed.

Charlie nodded. ""Something bad, but I'm not sure what it was that happened. Blaise wasn't able to talk about it and he fell asleep. There's a... Draco, whatever happened, it involved two of your friends and--""

He had to stop talking to grab Draco's shoulder and hold him down. ""Listen first,"" Charlie demanded. ""You need to know before you see her. The girl is injured beyond... Blaise said the only thing we could do for her is let her die.""

""What?"" Draco nearly shouted. ""What kind of bollocksed up bullshit--""

""If he saved them, they would be tortured over and over again. You know what it's like to be the entertainment."" Charlie hated to bring it up, but he needed Draco to understand what he would be facing out there. He watched the blond's face drain of color as he took that in. ""I wish I could take care of them myself, but it's morning so I can't just waltz out there.""

""Who?"" Draco asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Charlie swallowed, wondering what his young friend's response would be. ""Blaise said Daphne."" 

Draco pushed Charlie's arm off of him and threw on his glamour to be Drew-the-Healer's-Apprentice. Charlie just barely caught his arm as he followed Draco into the lab.

""Draco, if you need...""

Shaking him off, Draco said, ""I don't need anything."" 

Draco set his shoulders back in a stance that Charlie recognized as preparing himself for the worst. He strode out and headed toward the only occupied bed beyond ""Draco's"" own at the back. 

Charlie started to head back into the secret room when he heard a crash and the sound of retching. Merlin, that wasn't a good sign. Peeking his head out, he saw that Draco had crashed into a cart of supplies as he stumbled away from the body. Scourgifying the area where he had just been sick, Draco made his way shakily back to Charlie, nearly as transparent as a ghost.

""She was a friend,"" Draco snarled, looking like he might be sick again. ""They... they defiled her! Like they do everything!""

Charlie gave a mental sigh of relief at the past tense, knowing how fucked up it was to feel that way. ""She's passed?"" he asked quietly.

""Yes, she bloody well died. You stood by and let her. Too busy taking care of lover boy to help her. We could have saved her! Hidden her!"" Draco exclaimed. There were tears in his eyes, but he didn't let them fall. 

""Draco..."" Charlie started, but it was no use. The Slytherin had stormed into the secret room and sunk onto the sofa, head in his hands.

Charlie followed him, but didn't say anything. He didn't feel right sitting down next to Draco either. Not when he was so distraught and blaming it partially on Charlie.

""Blaise must have been ordered to keep her alive,"" Draco mused after a while. His body was trembling with the effort of reining in his emotions, but he managed.

""And he chose to save her as best he could instead,"" Charlie said gently despite his worry for the man he loved.

""He could have done something else!"" Draco started again but then finally let go of the sob he had been holding in. 

""Could he?"" Charlie asked. Draco just sobbed in response. They both knew the real answer. 

As his friend slowly calmed, Charlie thought he could find a way to help process what had happened. Maybe remember the good things. ""What was she like?""

""Daphne?"" Draco gave a half laugh through his tears. ""She was known as the Slytherin Ice Queen. Not the friendliest, but she had her moments. I would never have wished...""

""None of us would have,"" Blaise's voice came from the bedroom door. He was leaning on it heavily.

Charlie started to rise. ""Blaise, you need to rest.""

""No. I have to... have to deal with...""

""No, you don't,"" Charlie argued. ""I'll handle that when I go back to being Bart. Say you ordered me to dispose of the body on my way down.""

The look of relief on Blaise and Draco's faces was worth any discomfort he would deal with while handling the task. 

""What the bloody hell happened to her?"" Draco demanded.

Blaise paled, shaking his head. ""You know what happened to her. Don't make me say it, Drake.""

""You had to watch,"" Charlie stated, knowing it was true. 

""And it... Draco, it wasn't just her,"" Blaise said, tears starting down his cheeks again.

Draco paled even more dramatically. ""Was it Story? Was she just not as badly hurt? Or--""

""It was Goyle,"" Blaise said, his tone flat. ""And there wasn't... there wasn't enough of him left for me to supposedly try.""

""Are you sure they will believe you tried?"" Charlie asked, his worry for Blaise outweighing his revulsion at that statement.

""No,"" Blaise said.

""They'll punish you either way,"" Draco pointed out.

""I know. But... I did enough to them by giving the potions he forced me to. I deserve whatever punishment he gives me--""

""Don't you dare say that,"" Charlie said, feeling the well of rage he kept hidden at all the atrocities of their world peeking out for a moment. ""You deserve nothing because of this. None of you, none of us, deserve the insane things these monsters come up with.""

Blaise gave him a sad smile. ""Thank you, Charlie. But I'll be punished whether I accept it or not.""

""There's no reason to punish yourself more,"" Charlie insisted, moving to guide Blaise onto one of the large chairs, kneeling at his side. 

One slim hand closed around his, hanging onto Charlie like a lifeline. ""I can't live with this,"" Blaise said brokenly.

Draco surprised Charlie by appearing on Blaise's other side, kneeling in mirror image to himself and grabbing Blaise's other hand. ""Listen hear, git. We live with it by helping the ones still under their thumbs. People need you. And me as your apprentice. And Charlie when he busts us all out of here.""

""I don't know how--"" Charlie started, still worrying over the subject in his mind.

""Doesn't matter. You're going to whether there's a plan already or not,"" Draco continued confidently. ""We're strong enough together to make it through this and help others do the same. We can't save everyone."" His voice hitched as he must have been thinking about their friend in the other room. ""But we can save a lot of them. And we're bloody well going to.""

Charlie couldn't help but feel a surge of pride for the young man. He could see it shining in Blaise's eyes as well as he looked down at his friend in shock.

Draco stood before either of them could say anything. Squeezing Blaise on the shoulder, he said, ""I'm going to get to work on some potions for the day. I'll handle the infirmary for a while if you want to rest.""

Not waiting for an answer, Draco left the room. Charlie looked up at Blaise and reached up to dry a tear from his cheek. ""He's right, you know,"" Charlie said softly. ""We're going to get through this. It's horrible and terrifying and painful, but we'll make it.""

""Merlin willing,"" Blaise muttered, but nodded.

Charlie gave a half smile as he leaned forward. ""Until then, we have to live life as best we can, love."" He hesitated, stuck on how to comfort Blaise -- knowing he could use his body to distract him, but uncertain if it would be better to hold him and let him talk. He struggled to decide what Blaise would want most, relieved when his thoughts were interrupted.

""Could you hold me for a while, Charlie?"" Blaise begged. ""It won't be long. I have to--""

""I know. You have a lot to do, but let me take care of you for a while,"" Charlie said, pulling Blaise close and kissing his temple. It wasn't enough, but it was all he could do.

Warning: Talk of underage pregnancy from rape, nothing graphic

I apologize that the last chapter did not have a warning for character death. I have gotten complacent with the things happening being fairly calm on not needing warnings for a while there.

This story is slow going these days, but still moving and with direction.

Thank you to MistressLynn for her awesome alpha'ing.

Tue, June 16th

Hermione woke disgruntled. The slant of light into the infirmary told her it was later than she had planned to get up. The Order had a meeting scheduled just before lunch. Why hadn't anyone woken her? 

When she tried to get up, Hermione unfortunately realized there was good reason she had been left to sleep. While she felt better than she had last night, being with Draco hadn't restored her since the bond was interrupted by her anger. Idly, Hermione wondered if getting angry with him was detrimental to her healing.

""I can see the wheels turning,"" Ginny commented, making Hermione jump. 

She was curious as to why Ginny was here. But before she could ask, they heard voices nearby in the exam room. 

""You are indeed both with child,"" Madam Pomfrey was saying to the two girls. ""I can brew a simple potion to take care of the situation if you would prefer,"" she offered. Hermione felt a momentary surge of jealousy that she had been too far along for an abortion by the time her pregnancy was discovered. At least she assumed it had been, since no one mentioned it. She had never actually thought to ask.

""Yes, please,"" someone replied.

""Are you sure I'm not too far along?"" another girl asked.

""You are close. I'll need to make it quickly,"" Madam Pomfrey admitted.

But the second girl answered, ""No, don't bother. My family belongs to him now. Our Mum and Dad won't care what happened to me once they know I'm a blood traitor. Daphne would care, but I doubt very seriously that she'll make it out of there alive. So... so I want to keep the baby.""

""Child, a baby isn't like a replacement family. It will love you, of course, but it's not the same kind of love you receive from your parents or a close sibling,"" Madam Pomfrey spoke gently.

""I'm keeping the baby,"" the girl stated determinedly.

Madam Pomfrey nodded, ""Okay then, Astoria. Potions for the both of you for now. Nutrition, and anti-nausea. I'll begin brewing the other for you, Miss Brown.""

The two Death Eater girls. 

Hermione's eyes met Ginny's. This wasn't a conversation they should have been privy to, though it was hardly their fault Madam Pomfrey and her charges had forgotten to silence the room. 

With Ginny's help, Hermione slipped out of her bed and worked to get dressed before the others noticed and came out. She and Ginny quickly and quietly slipped through the infirmary and out the doors.

With a sigh of relief as the door closed, Ginny questioned, ""What do you think happened to them?""

Hermione knew her expression must be bleak from the way Ginny flinched. Grimly, she said, ""I think the Death Eaters use their own just as much as they do their prisoners and 'wives'. I doubt those two had any say in the situation that got them pregnant.""

""But maybe the father was someone they were dating or--"" Ginny started, her lip trembling as she tried to come up with other possibilities. 

Shaking her head, Hermione's voice dropped lower as she said, ""Not with the way they were discussing the babies. I know... I know what it feels like to have no idea who your baby's father is. And, for them, to know that it was rape, by enough men that it's impossible to tell... Those poor girls!""

""They'll be judged for it once people know,"" Ginny commented.

""And idiots who do will face me,"" Hermione fumed. 

Ginny looked at he. ""Are you sure, Mione? It's not always easy being the Slytherin defender around here.""

""What do you mean by that?"" Hermione asked curiously.

Ignoring her for the moment, Ginny said, ""It's nearly time for the post-ritual meeting, and we still need to get you some breakfast.""

""It's almost time for lunch,"" Hermione grumbled. ""We can just wait.""

Ginny rolled her eyes. ""I figured you would say something like that. Here, have a biscuit.""

""A biscuit for breakfast?"" Hermione asked in surprise.

""I promise it will help you feel better,"" Ginny told her as they walked.

She couldn't deny how right Ginny was. Nibbling on the biscuit made her feel much better -- more energetic and even more magically able. ""What was in this?""

Ginny grinned. ""They're just something a little special Sev and I made to boost the people who need it.""

""Sev?"" Hermione questioned.

""Sev. We're friends now. I know it sounds ridiculous to bake and be friends with Professor Snape, but he's not so bad once you get past the outer shell.""

Hermione stared at her friend in amused shock. They certainly got good results. There was no contesting that. ""So he's your Slytherin to defend?"" she asked.

Ginny nodded. ""And now Theo.""

""Harry and I are here to defend Theo as well. And Snape,"" she added hastily at Ginny's glare. Really, it was a wonder anyone dared still have bad feelings toward the man when Ginny had decided he was worth defending.

""I would offer for you to come bake with us, but I'm afraid I remember that time Mum tried to help you make biscuits,"" Ginny snickered.

""Ginevra Weasley, are you telling me Professor Snape is better at baking than I am?"" Hermione said with mock indignation.

""Shhhh. He's better at baking than I am,"" Ginny admitted. The two girls laughed and continued teasing each other along the halls.

Finally, they made it to the meeting room, a centrally located former classroom. Hermione's dearest hope for the meeting was that there wouldn't be too much more yelling, though she was certain Professor McGonagall wasn't the only person angry with her. 

When Ginny and Hermione arrived, it seemed that only a quarter of the Order was there. And those present looked tired and drawn. 

""Are you okay?"" Hermione found herself asking Kingsley.

""You tell me,"" he said with irritation, ""I've felt like this since your damn ritual yesterday. Are we going to get better or is this somehow permanent? We won't be much good in a fight--""

""Yes,"" Hermione assured him before he could outline the worst-case scenario she was already constructing in her head. ""You'll be feeling better in a day or so. In a way, we are each individually more vulnerable for this brief time period, but overall the castle is safer, which means we are safer.""

""I don't understand why--"" Kingsley began.

""Because that's how ritual magic works,"" Hermione snapped. 

Narrowing his eyes, Kingsley replied, ""I understand how ritual magic works, Lady Malfoy. What I don't understand is why this powerful ritual isn't enough.""

Hermione took a deep breath, trying to calm her irritation. ""As I've explained to Professor McGonagall, this is about the castle's sentience and overall integrity. I can explain more during the meeting when everyone is around to hear it.""

Kingsley began, ""I think I should be appraised before--""

""I'm not repeating myself so that you can feel important, especially with half the Order already here, Kingsley.""

Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. ""Let it go, Kingsley. I'm curious as well, but we can wait a few more minutes."" 

She spoke with more of a Scottish brogue than usual, clearly still annoyed with Hermione, but she had backed her nonetheless. Hermione wasn't sure what McGonagall's support meant, but she sent her former Professor a small smile in thanks. It was not returned.

Slowly, more Order members stumbled in, and Ginny handed out biscuits as people walked through the door. Most were already eating them before they realized Snape was standing there holding the tray she was taking the biscuits from. It was one thing to know he was helping to bake meeting refreshments,and quite another to see him standing there serving them. 

Hermione was amused by the skeptical looks, and watched as they began to perk up from Ginny and Snape's concoction. Her eye caught Snape's and she gave him a small nod of thanks. To her immense surprise, he smiled in return. 

She was happy to see Harry and Theo arrive together, looking far more comfortable than they had the day before. Both of them stopped by Ginny, Theo pecking her on the cheek and Harry giving her a real kiss. Madam Pomfrey arrived with the two young Death Eater girls. George was one of the last to come in, but he came straight over to Hermione to sit.

""Hullo, Mione,"" he greeted. ""How angry are they?""

""Plenty,"" she replied, unconcerned, ""But they'll get over it when they can start building again.""

""That will be a relief,"" he said wholeheartedly.

""You can say that again,"" Neville grumbled from her other side. Hermione glanced over and did a double take. Neville looked like a wraith. Cho was on his other side holding his hand, and appearedworried.

George leaned to her ear and said, ""He's not been doing well since his Gran passed.""

Hermione wanted to ask questions, but now wasn't the time. Kingsley stood and cleared his throat. ""As you all know, last night we performed a major ritual to secure the castle. Which means today, we can begin rebuilding.""

A relieved cheer went up. Leaving Hogwarts broken for so long concerned everyone. 

Kingsley continued, ""Each team will consist of builders and a runes expert. As we build, the wall interiors must be protected and tied into the rest of Hogwarts' magic.""

""What does that mean?"" someone called from the back.

Hermione stood. She needed to take control of the discussion. Walking to the front, she began. ""Some of you may know that this castle was built around 990 A.D. You may not know that the Founders carved runes into the foundations of the building and filled them with their own blood. It gave Hogwarts safety measures that protect the castle even today, despite the damage."" She was in full lecture mode, but didn't want to lose them. ""Do you know what else they did?""

When no one answered, George spoke cheekily, ""No, Professor. What did they do?""

Rolling her eyes, Hermione explained, ""Their blood and the rituals they did imbued the very walls of this castle with a sentience that normal buildings don't have. Even less known is that upon their deaths, the Founders sacrificed themselves to the castle itself, bonding their magic with the structure. Over the centuries, the magic given to the castle through their sacrifice has deteriorated to the point that it was possible to damage Hogwarts. Its defenders rose to the call, but were frankly overpowered. We can do better. We can rebuild, and do it even better!""

""How?"" Kingsley asked, too taken to pretend he knew what she was going to say next.

""We all know about the legendary Chamber of Secrets. That was Slytherin's room. What many don't realize is that each of the Founders had a secret room.""

""Where are they then?"" Seamus called from the back. 

Hermione bit her lip. ""That's the problem. We don't know. The Room of Requirement is one, I believe. Most all of us here know where that is.""

""Godric's room, certainly!"" Cormac shouted.

""No,"" Hermione disagreed. ""It's possible, but I don't believe so. The room gives whatever is required to whoever needs it, completely loyal to those within. It's impossible to be certain until we find the others, but I think it's Helga Hufflepuff's room."" 

""What if one of those special rooms has been destroyed?"" an Auror asked.

Unsure, Hermione shook her head. ""I don't think they can be, but we just don't know. There's so much we can't learn without finding the rooms themselves, unfortunately.""

""What do you think we're looking for?"" Anthony Goldstein asked. 

""I don't know,"" Hermione admitted, ""If we're looking for something of Ravenclaw's, I imagine it would be some sort of study or observatory.""

""Gryffindor's would have something to do with bravery,"" Arthur Weasley said quietly.

""Or foolishness,"" Snape countered, but low enough that Hermione doubted most of the crowd heard him. Those who did glowered at him. Even Theo.

""I ask because Susan and I found extra rooms we didn't know about when we were performing the ritual. I wonder if the others did as well.""

""There was at least one,"" Ginny volunteered. ""But I don't think that a tower bedroom is what either of the Founder's would have chosen as their special room."" 

She showed no signs of embarrassment, but Theo blushed profusely beside her. Muttering, Anthony admitted that a bedroom was one of the rooms he and Susan found as well, in addition to some other rooms he had never known about before.

""The real question is whether Freddie and I knew about them,"" George said. ""And the Marauders before us.""

""Perhaps you could explore with the map? George? Harry?"" Hermione suggested.

""They'll need to do it quickly if Harry is involved,"" Kingsley stated.

""Why?"" Harry demanded.

Kingsley stared at him as though Harry were a misbehaving child, ""You'll need to go back to the safe house this afternoon.""

""Only if Ginny is coming with me this time,"" Harry retorted.

""I see no reason why she should--"" Kingsley began, but Hermione knew she had to interrupt.

""Harry. I don't think she can. Neither can Theo. They both have to be in the castle, at least for now until the second ritual occurs,"" Hermione said sadly, knowing what it would mean for Harry to be separated from them both.

""What happens if they leave?"" Susan asked fearfully.

""I don't know,"" Hermione said, ""But I don't believe it would be good. If they're captured, it would be devastating for one. But also, their loss might destabilize the castle for all we know. It's a risk we shouldn't take.""

Ginny stood. ""Why should Harry leave?""

""He's a target,"" Kingsley said. 

""And the rest of us aren't? A giant castle full of the Resistance to their regime?"" Ginny asked incredulously.

Hermione cleared her throat. ""Wouldn't Harry be more of a target outside of Hogwarts?""

""He might--""

""He's right here. And he -- I -- want to return to my family home, which no one told me even existed by the way, but not right now. I understand you sent me there to keep me from going out on raids. I understand why now. Dean has the training under control and I want him to continue it. I'll stay in the castle.""

""No, you need to--"" Kingsley began again, but again Harry interrupted. 

""You may be in charge of the Order as a whole, but you're not in charge of me, Kings. I remember all those tactical conversations Ron told me about. And I know the stupid prophecy. I'm a key player here and I won't be treated like a child and ordered around."" 

""You don't get to make decisions like that, Mr. Potter,"" Professor McGonagall said, not unkindly. 

""I'm sorry, Professor, but I do. I'm an adult. I've hunted and destroyed Horcruxes. I have literally died for this cause. I'm staying in this castle. I'll go back to Potter Manor when it's time. Until then, I'm living here. I'll behave myself and not go out on my own or even with large raids. I get it. My safety is important to the war efforts. But I won't be controlled any longer."" Harry was standing firm, not shouting, but he didn't need to.

Hermione felt a swell of pride. Across the room, she saw Andromeda with a similar look. There were those who appeared worried, and some their age seemed disgruntled that Harry wasn't doing as he was told when they had to, but for the most part, they seemed willing to accept Harry's stance. He was the Chosen One after all.

""I will be staying here at the castle as well,"" she announced. 

""You can't--"" Kingsley began.

Glaring him down, Hermione said, ""I need the library, my partner in figuring this out will be here, and communication is abysmal. Which, I have somewhat of a solution for that.""

She reached into her bag and began to pull out notebooks and bits of jewelry. ""I've combined the Protean Charm with a few other spells depending on the medium, and made anew method of communication. Laying the objects out on a table, she explained, ""The notebooks are for communicating between people in the written word. You write in it, the receiver sees the words and writes back. The jewelry is less explicit but easier to take into a battle.""

""I can see how it would be convenient to wear,"" Dean commented, ""But what does it do?""

""Well, the necklaces, for instance, heat up like the DA coins did and you can project a message onto them with your thoughts,"" Hermione explained. ""The rings heat up but only have a few letters. You'd need a code. They're not ideal, but better than nothing. I was working with the pieces I had.""

There were more questions and Hermione answered until she began to lose patience. ""We can learn more one on one if you are given the devices. Having real communication will help the efforts of us all.""

There were murmurs of agreement and then Kingsley took back control of the meeting. ""The next order of business is that, again, we have prisoners we need to deal with.""

""They are not prisoners,"" Snape snapped. ""They are children and they are under my protection.""

""Is this about Story and Maggie?"" a voice asked. Hermione was surprised to see that it was Hannah speaking. 

Professor McGonagall blinked. ""Do you know them?""

""I do,"" Hannah said. 

""You didn't mention that before,"" Kingsley stated, looking perplexed.

Hannah shrugged, blushing. ""I was afraid to speak up. They wore Death Eater robes and I thought they weren't the girls I remembered.""

""What makes you think they are now?"" Professor McGonagall asked.

""I've spoken with them and recognized who they are. I think they can be trusted,"" Hannah insisted. She looked around, then smiled when she saw Susan Bones nearby, holding little Teddy for Andromeda. ""Don't you think so, Sue?"" she implored.

""Yes, even though they were Slytherins, we could trust them even when the Carrows ran the school,"" Susan agreed. ""They were the ones who told us about the adapted Cruciatus, that if it didn't hurt to act like it did anyway.""

""Trust is a strong sentiment,"" Kingsley said, and nodded grudgingly to Snape, ""But we do need to find somewhere they can be properly housed."" 

""There is no reason why they can't live in the Slytherin dorms again. There aren't students to be bothered by them,"" Snape advocated.

""Pardon me,"" Madam Pomfrey spoke up. ""I would like to speak on behalf of young Maggie. She helped in the hospital wing last year and would be well-suited to stay where she has been.""

""With Ron Weasley?"" Professor McGonagall asked somewhat shocked. Everyone began talking, especially the adults.

""Yes,"" the matron replied. ""You've trusted them to do it already and it has worked well. It has been Maggie doing most of the tending. During their exam this morning, she expressed her wishes to continue. It helps us to have someone with him. Why not continue?""

Kingsley held up a hand. ""We'll consider this, but it would still leave Miss Greengrass on her own. They each need a handler. For that matter, General Ron can't be the handler for Miss Brown. Someone else will have to mind her.""

""I'll be hers,"" Cormac offered. ""I was friends with her sister, after all."" 

""You were not!"" Parvati argued suddenly. ""I will be her handler. Cormac just wants to get his hands on her. Lavender was like my sister, which makes Maggie my little sister, too."" She was sniffling by the end of the statement, saddened by thoughts of her friend.

""Do you think you can be impartial if this little sister of yours is doing something that proves she's a danger to us?"" Professor McGonagall asked.

""Of course,"" Parvati replied, insulted. ""I'm not letting anyone hurt General Ron or our war effort in any way.""

""That's decided then,"" Kingsley said with relief. ""Now for the other...""

A couple of boys raised their hands but Kingsley shook his head to the negative. ""I think it would be best if she's paired with a girl.""

No one moved for a long moment, then two hands went up. Susan and an older lady with a cat on her lap.

Kingsley appeared instantly bothered. ""Susan, you have already said you're friends. This would be a conflict of interest for you. Not to mention that your work tending the little ones is very important to our efforts. Miss Turnbuckle, I'm afraid you may be a little too old--""

""Excuse me, young man, did you just say I'm too old to guide a young witch to the side of the light? Let me remind you that I used to babysit you as a child and change your nappies,"" Miss Eliza Turnbuckle informed him primly.

Blinking, Kingsley glanced around, noting everyone's amusement. Most didn't seem perturbed by the thought of the old woman taking this Death Eater girl in hand. 

Indeed, Miss Turnbuckle added, ""I'll get her straightened out, nice and proper.""

Madam Pomfrey snorted and Hermione remembered the conversation they had overheard. She met Ginny's gleeful eyes. Hermione wasn't sure what she felt personally, but she knew things were going to be very hard for Story with Miss Turnbuckle. The ancient witch was ruthless.

""Okay, then,"" Kingsley relented. Trying to make it sound like his own idea, he announced each of the girls' keepers and that if anyone saw them acting suspiciously, to please report them.

""Are we going to talk about Ron?"" George asked from beside her. 

Hermione took his hand, knowing how hard this was for him, for all the Weasleys. Ron had been a terrible git to her, but he was still family, for her as well as them, and Hermione was worried about him, too.

""I believe that discussion will be held amongst the war council and those working on his cure--""

""You mean Snape,"" Seamus said, arms folded across his chest.

""I--""

Ginny stood. ""Yes, he means Sev, who you might recall has been working with me since the battle and brought both Harry and Mum back to us after it. He's doing the best he can for Ron, too,"" she said, furious that her friend was so distrusted.

There was a general hush for a moment, though it was hard to tell whether people were ashamed of their assumptions or afraid of Ginny. The girl was formidable and Hermione suspected that was more the cause of silence. 

Trying to regain control of the situation, Professor McGonagall stated, ""Yes, we mean Severus, who is working around the clock to provide potions and come up with a cure. It is a complex curse, and so may take a while yet but I am confident he will find a solution.""

""And when he does,"" Kingsley continued, ""he'll be our General again. Until then, I am working with Auror Robards to ensure any raids we run continue to be successful.""

""You don't sound like we're planning to go out,"" Angelina observed loudly.

Kingsley narrowed his eyes at her slightly, but nodded. ""For the time being, all of our efforts will be focused here, on rebuilding the castle, unless there is something we need to respond to.""

""Is it best to take such a defensive approach?"" Percy asked.

Professor McGonagall peered over her glasses at him. ""While an offensive might be nice, we need to first ensure those we protect are safe.""

""We also need to be searching for the Founders' rooms,"" Hermione spoke up to remind them.

""That, too, if we should come across them, but it's not our first priority until the walls are rebuilt,"" Professor McGonagall replied firmly. 

As much as she disliked the thought of waiting to determine the next ritual, Hermione could understand why the rebuilding was more important right now. She just hoped the Death Eaters didn't take them away from the task before it could be completed. Surely with magic they could move more quickly than with Muggle construction.

""Everyone, please move to the side as your names are called to receive your new teams and orders.""

Hermione listened for her own name as she watched others being sorted.

""They won't be calling on you,"" a voice that sounded vaguely familiar said.

She jumped and turned, seeing the girl she had heard in the infirmary just a little while ago -- Story. ""What are you doing here?""

""Madam Pomfrey came and got us when the meeting was basically over, to turn us over to our keepers,"" the girl said with a smile.

Processing that, Hermione returned to what Story had said to her. ""Whyever would they not call on me?""

Rolling her eyes, Story said, ""You're pregnant. And your mind is too valuable. They'll need you for other things.""

""But we need everyone working together. They just said--""

Story shook her head. ""You're not part of everyone. Look, they haven't called Harry yet either, though I bet he'll wind up helping anyway.""

""Of course he will,"" Hermione agreed with a huff. She'd like to see them try and stop him. What was their excuse at any rate? That a rock might fall on him? That could happen inside the broken walls as well and no one had worried so far. She ignored the little voice saying they tried to make him leave the castle, so maybe they were worried about that, too.

""You, young lady, will be spending some extended time in the Hospital Wing recovering,"" Madam Pomfrey said, having walked up behind her. ""And you,"" she said to Story, ""go find Miss Turnbuckle. And mind you, be good to her.""

""Yes, Madam Pomfrey. Of course,"" Story answered humbly before walking off toward the ancient witch.

""Do you see how she just did as she was told?"" Madam Pomfrey asked. For a moment Hermione didn't realize she had been speaking to her. When their eyes met, she saw the matron's expectant look and began to heat up for an argument. But Madam Pomfrey shook her head. ""No. You've gotten away with too much, child. Your body -- and especially your child -- can't take much more right now. It's time to rest.""

""Please do, Hermione,"" Theo said. Harry nodded beside him. 

""Why would the two of you--""

""Because you need it,"" Harry said. ""We're safe here and they're not making us leave. You can take a break and let your magic settle for a few days. Merlin knows mine needs to as well.""

""Perhaps you should come to the hospital wing as well,"" Madam Pomfrey suggested.

""Erm... no. I just meant... there's no shame in her going,"" Harry said while Theo snickered beside him.

Madam Pomfrey looked him over before nodding. ""You two run along. But you, Lady Malfoy, are coming with me.""

**********

Draco could barely make himself get out of bed. What was the bloody point? All he was allowed to do was make fucking potions to contain as much of the Dark Lord's damage as possible. Some of the potions would go to the evil bastards who worshiped Voldemort instead of to the people who needed them. He wasn't even able to leave the infirmary today. It would be Blaise's day to make the rounds.

That was when he noticed the sounds. Someone was in the potions lab. His potions lab. He moved quickly, throwing on clothes and scampering to the door of their secret room, peering through the crack provided to him by the Manor. 

Blaise. It was just Blaise. 

Though as he got a closer look at his friend stumbling between cauldrons, he had cause for concern. Glamouring himself as the healer's apprentice just in case, Draco stepped out and approached the man.

Within moments, his doubt about Blaise's identity was swept away. Graceless though he was right now, the man was undoubtedly his friend. Draco had just never seen him quite like this. His hands were shaking as he stumbled about, dropping things in the cauldron and muttering. There were bags under his eyes and he looked worn, like he had lost weight and perhaps sanity overnight. 

""Blaise?"" he whispered, not wanting to break the man's trance, but needing to check on his friend.

A potion bottle dropped to the floor and shattered, as Blaise whipped his wand out. ""Who's there?"" he demanded, not seeming to recognize Draco's alternate self.

Draco dropped the glamour, and held his hands up. ""It's just me, Blaise. Just Draco. Are you... what are you doing?""

""I'm making a potion, a bloody cure,"" Blaise slurred.

""A cure for what?"" Draco asked, trying to sound calm. He knew Blaise hadn't been okay since Charlie left the day before, taking Daphne's body with him. Merlin, Draco wasn't okay either. But Blaise's stupor was beyond anything he had seen in their many years of friendship.

""For their spying curse. For whatever they did to the Weasel. This has to bloody end, Drake. We can't keep losing people to this fucking madman. And our next step is to make sure the Dark Lord doesn't have a spy on them.""

""Blaise..."" He wanted to tell his friend to go rest. Blaise had obviously been up most, if not all of the night, but he knew better than to suggest it. Instead, Draco swallowed hard and asked, ""Have you made any progress?""

""I don't know,"" Blaise groaned, dropping onto a stool and rubbing a hand over his face. ""No. I think... No, I'm bloody certain there is some kind of spell component necessary. Without having a sample of the Weasel's blood, it's hard to experiment on the potion, but I don't know what else to do. How to figure out the charm.""

""We need to know more about the spell that was used,"" Draco surmised.

Blaise nodded, but looked even more defeated. ""Dolohov created it, like all the other horror show magic that the Dark Lord loves. There's no way to get information from him.""

They both stared at the ground, fighting their frustration and feelings of helplessness. Then Blaise gasped. ""Your mother,"" he said.

The blood drained from Draco's face. He couldn't think of her. Not when she still considered him a monster. Not when he always would be one to her.

Blaise appeared contrite, but continued, ""She might know something Draco!""

""H-how are you going to get her to talk to you?"" he asked, knowing his mother had shown nothing but her pureblood icy mask since it happened. 

Blaise's face fell. ""I don't know. But I have to try. Who else could--"" He paused, seeming to realize how painful it would be for Draco to not be someone she would talk to.

Shaking his head to clear his overwhelming feelings, Draco slowly said, ""One of the other slaves maybe. One of the women. They see each other sometimes.""

""Who would be brave enough, foolhardy enough to--""

""My cousin,"" Draco said, suddenly certain she was the answer.

Blaise looked up at him and Draco saw the acknowledgement in his friend's eyes, though he still tried to deny it. ""Tonks shouldn't have to sacrifice--""

""But she will. She'll at least try. She needs this war to end even more than we do. She's got a kid out there,"" Draco said.

Running his hands over his face again, Blaise stood and vanished the mess he had made in the cauldron along with the shattered potions bottle. ""I'll go--""

""No. You're resting here in the infirmary today,"" Draco told him. ""I'll get you to bed if you need to stay available. You need rest.""

""I can't,"" Blaise protested.

""You have to,"" Draco insisted. ""They didn't come for you last night. You know they will tonight.""

""Or another night soon. The times he waits are always worse and you know tonight will be bad.""

""Fortunately, your apprentice is barely competent, so he can't kill you,"" Draco reminded him.

""Is that a blessing or a curse?"" Blaise asked. 

""A blessing for us making it out of here alive,"" Draco stated firmly. ""And for helping to put an end to all this. Now get to bed. I have potions to gather and rounds to make. I'll talk to Tonks."""

I can grin darkly to myself, making that parallel, because no one will mind, and no one will even notice. No one's going to read Remus John Lupin's thoughts out of boredom or curiosity...well, Sirius might try, but he'd have to find the spell first, and anything that requires that much work isn't worth it in his book. So I'll lounge in the common room and listen to his laugh meld with hers, while at the same time I'll lounge in my thoughts and think of what could be if he'd only been a little bit different...a little like me.

He beckons me over to speak, and I stand, pushing such thoughts aside.

When I look into his eyes, I smile, even if my feelings are futile...."

It's not an unfamiliar sight, or an uncommon one, so Gideon barely registers it as he unpacks his groceries. At times like these, he allows his over-observational tendencies to fall by the wayside and just basks in the peace of his apartment and Spencer's presence.

            What is different, which Gideon only registers when he turns fully to ask the genius how he'd like his steak, is that Spencer is reading.

            Reading. Not Spencer-reading, just reading. He's hunched over with panicked anticipation, fingers thumbing through the pages at a fraction of his usual pace even as his eyes flash rapidly across each line. It's even the same book; its lovingly worn blue cover telegraphs its persistence.

            ""Good book?"" Gideon questions.

            ""Uncommonly,"" Spencer murmurs. Gideon bites back a smile as he turns back to the stove; that will be the last of Spencer's attention he receives until they sit down to eat.

            He makes Spencer's steak medium and cuts it in half because he knows the young doctor won't eat it all tonight - if he can pull his focus away from his novel long enough to eat at all. Spencer doesn't look up at his plate until Gideon manually presses a fork into his hand.

            ""Eat,"" he commands, and Spencer does. The book is set aside, a paper napkin holding his place. ""We could play chess after dinner.""

            ""Maybe after I finish my book,"" Spencer offers.

            Gideon eyes the paperback. There are still a good hundred pages under the napkin. ""Alright.""

            They make idle small talk, nothing important of existential but interesting, none the less.

            Afterward, Spencer has an eager bounce in his step as he takes their plates to the sink. He glances back at the book on the table and Gideon shoos him toward it. He rinses the dishes and tosses them in the washer. It doesn't take long.

            When he turns back, Spencer is enthusiastically devouring his novel once more. Gideon can't help the small, indulgent smile that tugs at his lips.

            It looks like they won't be playing chess tonight.

            More than an hour passes before Gideon hear the scrape of Spencer's chair across the tile. Gideon has already settled into bed, but he sets aside the case files he's been reviewing in favor of a compendium of quotes JJ gave him. It's sat unopened on his nightstand for weeks.

            After the Fisher King, Hotch mandated a solid week of vacation. At home, Gideon's been doing his best to keep Spencer from profiling entirely; he needs a break. Gideon doesn't, but it wouldn't be good if the young genius saw him working.

            He's bored by the time Spencer finishes readying for bed. The quotes are cliche and overused, and he's already spotted three botched sources. Besides, Spencer cuts a far more distracting vision, bundled up in plaid flannel and one of Gideon's schools shirts from thirty years ago. It's no chore to set the volume aside and wait for Spencer to join him, just watching.

            ""You were reading slowly tonight,"" he comments as the younger man settles into his side. A cheek rubs against his chest, vibrating with Spencer's acknowledging hum. ""Is something wrong with your subconscious processing?""

            ""It deserved conscious realization,"" Spencer answers.

            ""Yeah?"" Gideon's hand finds its way into Spencer's hair, scraping gently against his scalp. ""What was it about?""

            ""It was Harry Potter,"" Spencer explains, as if Gideon hadn't at least read the cover. ""JJ thought I'd like it. It's, uh, it's about a school for wizards.""

            Gideon knows the plot, of course; the series has become somewhat of a cultural phenomenon, and Stephen's been singing its praises since he read the first one on a girlfriend's recommendation in college. But he'd like to hear what Spencer thinks, and it's not often that the genius feels he can explain things to Gideon.

            ""I don't know how to explain it,"" Spencer says. ""It's a children's book, but it's well-written and complex... it's incredible.""

            ""I'll have to read it,"" Gideon says, omitting the fact that he already has. Stephen can be persistent, and he'd had no choice once JJ joined the fray.

            A tentative arm snakes its way across the older man's chest.

            ""My mom - the other day, she said the best way to read something is to have it read to you. By someone you love.""

            Is that so? Spencer's mother is a smart woman, but Gideon suspects this is a pointed hint.

            ""So read it to me,"" he suggests.

            The younger man's eyes slip shut as Gideon presses a careful kiss to his forehead. The lamp is turned off, and still Spencer's smile illuminates the darkened room.

            ""Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much..."""

Harry doesn't know how he got here, standing on Draco's porch, the rain a constant thrumming in his ears. He doesn't know why Draco is inside, or why he's upset at him. 

""Where's my Harry Potter? Where's the bloody Gryffindor who protects those he loves because he loves them, not because he needs it for the fame? Where'd he go?"" 

Draco's glare is so violent it lights him up from the inside, but Harry knows there's disappointment, heartbreak, lined in those silver pools. He knows Draco's expressions, he knows everything about this man in front of him. 

""I don't know you anymore, Potter.""

The use of the last name stabs him in the heart more than anything. These last few years he'd just been Harry, or love, or my darling, in the most tender of times. In these last few years he'd grown closer, they'd grown closer. 

""You need him,"" Harry says. ""I could be him."" 

""I don't want you to have to try to be him,"" Draco says, almost pleadingly. ""I don't want you to try to be him, Harry. I want you to just be him...just be you.""

Harry doesn't understand. Of course he is himself, he has never changed. But Draco is the fourth person to have told him he's changed. Hermione and Ron said almost the same thing when he left their home for the last time a few months ago, and Luna had told him as much when she saw him in Diagon last week. 

""I just want him back..."" Draco's voice is so broken, so devastated, that it tears at something deep within Harry's chest. Tears are streaming down his elegant face. 

""He can't come back. He won't come back.""

""Well,"" Draco says, retreating back into the house, wiping at his eyes. ""Let me know if he does.""

Harry stands on the porch so long that he can no longer distinguish the rain from the tears on his face."

Privet Drive was full of normal families and normal lives, and no family was more normal than the Dursleys.
The Dursleys lived in a perfect little two story home and were a seemingly perfect three person household.
The thin long necked wife was speaking about a fight between one of the neighboring couple, the little necked husband was barely listening and thought about his drill company, Grunnings, instead, and the extremely fat son was trying to watch the TV from the table but was distracted by his food.
Seeing this family, there would be no thoughts of anything abnormal, but there was one abnormality in this family and that abnormality had a name.
The young boy was currently resting on his mattress, he was given a meal hours ago and was still hungry. He looked around the room as he struggled to sleep. The dimly lit room wasn't a bedroom at all, but the cupboard under the stairs was the only room that Harry Potter ever had."
